Can we make this quick? Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad. Again.
Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part. Please.
You're asking me out. That's so cute. What's your name again?
No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
Cameron.
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser. My sister. I can't date until she does.
Why?
Unsolved mystery. She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
C'esc ma tete. This is my head
Right. See? You're ready for the quiz.
I don't want to know how to say that though. I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are. How much does champagne cost? Stuff like Chat. I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
That's because it's such a nice one.
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
There.
You got something on your mind?
You have my word. As a gentleman
How do you get your hair to look like that?
Sure have.
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't. Not unless my sister goes.
She's not a...
Lesbian? No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
Hi.
You know Chastity?
Have fun tonight?
I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".
I was?
Well, no...
Then that's all you had to say.
But
Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."
do you listen to this crap?
What crap?
Me. This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
What good stuff?
The "real you".
I'm kidding. You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"? And you don't know how to quit?
No
Wow
She okay?
They do to!
Did you change your hair?
No.
Where did he go? He was just here.
Who?
Great
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
Is he oily or dry?
Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
It's more
Exactly So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge. And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
Queen Harry?
Neat...
Hey, sweet cheeks.
Hi, Joey.
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.
Where've you been?
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
Oh, I thought you might have a date I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
What do you think?
You're ruining my life' Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.
What's normal?
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
It's Shakespeare. Maybe you've heard of him?
You are so completely unbalanced.
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
I don't get you. You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.
Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.
Like you care.
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
Joey never told you we went out, did he?
What?
In 9th. For a month
Why?
He was, like, a total babe
But you hate Joey
Now I do. Back then, was a different story.
He said everyone was doing it. So I did it.
You did what?
But
After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it. And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
Why didn't you tell me?
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
That's not
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
You looked beautiful last night, you know.
Let go!
You set me up.
I just wanted --
What? To completely damage me? To send me to therapy forever? What?
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
Patrick -- is that- a.
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating. End of discussion.
What if she never starts dating?
Then neither will you. And I'll get to sleep at night.
But she doesn't want to date.
Daddy, I --
And where're you going?
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
Otherwise known as an orgy?
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
Oh, God. It's starting.
Wear the belly before you go.
Daddy, no!
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
Why?
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
The prom? Kat has a date?
No, but
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
He's not a "hot rod". Whatever that is.
You're not going unless your sister goes. End of story.
I'm missing something.
Always a pleasure, Brucie.
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan. Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
Fan of a fan. You see a couple of minors come in?
Never
Padua girls. One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
You the new guy?
So they tell me...
So -- which Dakota you from?
North, actually. How'd you ?
I was kidding. People actually live there?
Yeah. A couple. We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
How many people were in your old school?
Thirty-two.
Get out!
How many people go here?
That I'm used to.
That girl -- I --
You burn, you pine, you perish?
Who is she?
Bianca Stratford. Sophomore. Don't even think about it
Why not?
Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
Because they're bred to. Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
He always have that shit-eating grin?
You know French?
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.
That's her? Bianca's sister?
I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.
What about him?
What makes you think he'll do it?
He seems like he thrives on danger
No kidding. He's a criminal. I heard he lit a state trooper on fire. He just got out of Alcatraz...
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
I'm serious, man, he's whacked. He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
Forget his reputation. Do you think we've got a plan or not?
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set. You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list. With me by your side.
I thought you hated those people.
You got him involved?
This is it. A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
Will Bogey get bent?
Number one. She hates smokers
It's a lung cancer issue
Her favorite uncle
He's pretty!
Assail your ears for one night.
You told me that part already.
Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
The hell is that? What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
Buttholus extremus. But hey, you're making progress.
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
What've you got for me?
Okay -- Likes: Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion".
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
Cameron, I'm a little busy
What 're you talking about?
Cameron -- do you like the girl?
Sure
What'd you do to her?
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns . That's a direct quote
You makin' any headway?
She kissed me.
What's the worst?
The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow. Tough break.
Hey -- do you mind?
Where ya goin?
Away.
Leave my sister alone.
Yeah
Two legs, nice rack...
Yeah, whatever. I want you to go out with her.
Sure, Sparky. I'll get right on it.
You just said
You need money to take a girl out
You got it, Verona. I pick up the tab, you do the honors.
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend. And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
Take it or leave it. This isn't a negotiation.
When I shell out fifty, I expect results.
I'm on it
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
I just upped my price
What?
A hundred bucks a date.
Forget it.
It's about time.
How'd you do it?
Do what?
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers. Another hundred for the tux --
Hey.
Are you lost?
Nope - just came by to chat
We don't chat.
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you. You know, just to see if you're interested.
But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?
Does this conversation have a purpose?
I hear you're helpin' Verona.
Uh, yeah. We're old friend*
You and Verona?
You better not fuck this up. I'm heavily invested.
Who's that?
Patrick Verona Random skid.
That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.
I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
He always look so
Mandella, eat. Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.
What's this?
I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions. You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.
William would never have gone to a state school.
William didn't even go to high school
That's never been proven
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming. Do you mind?
Does it matter?
You think this'll work?
What'd he say?
You went to the party? I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.
I didn't have a choice.
You didn't have a choice? Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
You didn't
Can you even imagine? Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
Listen to you! You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
Okay, okay, we won't go. It's not like I have a dress anyway
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective. We're making a statement.
Have you seen him?
Who?
William - he asked me to meet him here.
I mean Wo-man. How ya doin'?
Sweating like a pig, actually. And yourself?
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
Pick you up Friday, then
The night I take you to places you've never been before. And back.
Like where? The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
You hate me don't you?
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
And why would I do that?
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
You -- covered in my vomit.
Are you following me?
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
You're not a big talker, are you?
hey. Great show, huh?
Excuse me?
That's what you want, isn't it?
You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there.
You know who The Raincoats are?
What's this?
"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
I say, do what you wanna do.
Okay?
You're not okay.
I just need to lie down for awhile
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
I know, just let me sleep
This is so patronizing.
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
Why 're you doing this?
I told you
You don't care if I die
Sure, I do
Why?
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
Like you could find one
See that? Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
Why'd you let him get to you?
Who?
Dorsey.
I hate him.
I know. It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
Hey man. . . You don ' t think I can be "cool"? You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?
I thought you were above all that
Kat! Wake up!
And I'm in control of it.
When you were gone last year -- where were you?
Busy
Were you in jail?
Maybe.
No, you weren't
Then why'd you ask?
I should do this.
Do what?
Start a band?
My father wouldn't approve of that that
Oh, so now you think you know me?
So what ' s up with your dad? He a pain in the ass?
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
Who?
BIANCA
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique? I lost my copy.
What are you doing here?
I heard there was a poetry reading.
You 're so --
Wholesome.
Unwelcome.
Unwelcome? I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
So what did I have an effect on ?
He left! I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
C'mon. It's not that bad
Put your right foot there --
Forget it. I'm stayin'.
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
The Partridge Family?
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect. And piss you off.
Good call.
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
A soft side? Who knew?
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
So what's your excuse?
Acting the way we do.
Yes
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
Something like that
Then you screwed up
How?
You up for it?
State trooper?
Fallacy.
The duck?
Hearsay.
Tell me something true.
I hate peas.
No -- something real. Something no one else knows.
You're sweet. And sexy. And completely hot for me.
What?
No one else knows
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
Is that a request or a command?
You know what I mean
No.
No what?
No, I won't go with you
Why not?
Create a little drama? Start a new rumor? What?
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
You tell me.
You need therapy. Has anyone ever told you that?
Answer the question, Patrick
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
It's Scurvy's. His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
It's just something I had. You know
Oh huh
My grandmother's .
What?
That ' s completely adorable!
Wait I...
You were paid to take me out! By -- the one person I truly hate. I knew it was a set-up!
It wasn't like that.
Really? What was it like? A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.
Is that right?
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
Because I like to torture you.
Oh, Bianca? Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
I know.
I thought we decided you were going to school here. At U of 0.
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
My insurance does not cover PMS
Then tell them I had a seizure.
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
I thought you were punishing me.
Why can't we agree on this?
Because you're making decisions for me.
As a parent, that's my right
So what I want doesn't matter?
You're eighteen. You don't know what you want. You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
Was that your sister?
Yeah. She left with some bikers Big ones. Full of sperm.
I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food. Is this something I should be hip to?
No, Daddy.
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
Parts of it.
Which parts?
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
Bianca did what?
What's the matter? Upset that I rubbed off on her?
You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives. It means we've become spectators. Bianca still lets me play a few innings. You've had me on the bleachers for years. When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.
When I go?
Katarina Stratford. My, my. You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild. By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls. I was merely a spectator.
Tempestuous?
Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now? Or do I have some time to think about it?
Hey there. Tired of breathing?
Hi.
Cool pictures. You a fan?
You think?
Macbeth, right?
Right.
Kat a fan, too?
Say it
What?
What plan?
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure. Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.
That's where we can help you. With Kat.
So Dorsey can get the girl?
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
What?!
Are you telling me I'm a - "non-smoker"?
Ever been to Club Skunk?
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
So you got cozy with she who stings?
You were right. She's still pissed.
Sweet love, renew thy force!
I missed you.
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
It was a bratwurst. I was eating lunch.
I don't understand, Patrick. You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?
Touch of the flu.
Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
What's to discuss?
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
You're completely demented.
In the microwave.
What's a synonym for throbbing?
Jesus! Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
Tumescent!
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home. Let her go.
What do you wanna watch? We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
Have a great time, honey!
What just happened?
Your daughters went to the prom.
Did I have anything to say about it?
Absolutely not.
I never seen heat like this! Not even in Las Minas!
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
What are you listening to, chicken ass?
Ah, leave him alone. He's doing no harm.
He's the devil's child...
We should have seen land.
We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
You say Asia can be found by sailing west?
Yes, your Eminence. The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ... Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle? Erathostene? Ptolemeus?
I am, Your Eminence
Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew. I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.
Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter. And that is to make the journey. I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.
Your life, and that of others!
Trade, Your Excellency. According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.
Is that all that interests you? Gold?
If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?
Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.
The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...
The Judgment is ours!
He is a mercenary! Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
You can see for yourself.
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
I could be gone for years.
I know.
I haven't given you much of a life.
Well... that's true. I have a child by a man who won't marry me! Who's always leaving...
Are we going to argue?
Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...
She said yes.
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
I don't want you to wait for me.
Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
You don't usually ask.
God... you're so beautiful! I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...
They took everything...
Can't you stay with us a little?
What is it, now? Tell me...
I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands? Is it not so?
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
May I ask by whom?
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
My letters of appointment.
Appointment to what?
Viceroy of the West Indies.
How far from here?
I am not a seaman. But I heard it is no more than a week at sea. I hope you are not too disappointed.
How could I be? The mainland has been found. Exactly as I said it would.
I want to go with you!
There'll be a time.
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
I have to explore the mainland.
How are you feeling, Fernando?
Father...
What are you listening to?
What does he say?
He asks when he can come to visit you. He left his address.
I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father. From the beginning. Everything.
Really? God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
No...
No?
I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.
I'm not bargaining!
And were you never ambitious, Excellency? Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?
They don't see sin in their nakedness. They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...
You defend yourself admirably...
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
You seem to have a special talent for making friends.
What...? Do I have so many already?
All I have to do is call the guards.
I am not afraid of you. You are nothing but a dreamer.
What do you see?
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
Say not here! Cuba!
What is it? A tribe? An island?
You come! You speak first!
Tell the Chief we thank him.
Chief knows.
Chief says -- how many?
Thousands.
To bring the word of God.
Chief says -- he has a God.
... and also to bring medicine.
Chief says...
We will work with his people. We want peace. Ask the Chief if he understands?
He understands.
You have to find them, Utapan. Look what they did!
Utapan, won't you speak to me? You used to know how to speak to me.
Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon. Even brothers from different mothers...
God... That's in a week!
That's what it says.
How did you manage it?
Why do you wish to sail west?
How can you be so certain? The Ocean is said to be infinite.
Ignorance! I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
How can you be so certain?
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
Esdras is a Jew.
Two minutes... and already you're a dead man. Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
Father Marchena!
Passion is something one cannot control!
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
Wait! I've waited seven years already! How much longer do you want me to wait?
If God intends you to go, then you will go.
Colon!
All of them! Just lies!
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
I am listening, my son.
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men. And I betrayed you.
What are you saying?
I lied. The journey will be longer than I said.
How long?
May God forgive you...! You must tell them! You must tell your men!
If I tell them, they won't follow me. You know that I am right, Father. You trust me...
My son, my son... Your certitudes are sometimes frightening... Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
I believed in you...
I suppose we're both old men now.
I have to disagree.
I knew you would.
New worlds create new people.
Oh? So you are a new man?
I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no. But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.
The ocean is uncrossable?
What did they say about Granada before today?
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
May I speak freely?
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
I know what I see. I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is. Who's not afraid. I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
How old are you, Senor Colon?
Do they have such thoughts?
But without your brothers. Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies. You may explore the continent.
Thank you.
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
And you say this is an Indian vice? By God! I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
We lost cousins, friends. We will wash this in blood.
You want a war? Fine. We are a thousand. They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill? Which tribe?
We don't need to know.
We can't raise the wheel without it.
Don Moxica -- we all have to work.
In one act of brutality, you have created chaos. Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us! All that because of your criminal savagery!
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions. Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
Due west, Captain Mendez. And may God be with us...
Well... It's the men, Sir. They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...
And what do you think Mendez?
Well, I surely know what a quadrant is! But I've never seen it used at night before.
What do you read?
What's he doing?
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
Where can I meet this man?
You lied! You cheated! We're way past 750 leagues!
Six days ago, yes.
You must be mad...!
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
You think I don't know that?
We're lost!
The land is there. I know it!
You don't know anything! Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
And then what? Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
Jesus Maria! I should have never listened to you!
You never did. You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
You bloody...
Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward! Think about that!
You tell that to them!
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.
... Into a monk...
Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying. But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.
... But there is worse. He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?
He must be replaced.
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.
Then why?
Are you my attorney? I'm Emil. I'm insane.
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
Oh no! No! Shit!
Emil. Take it easy. Stay with me. Sit down. What do you need? What are you looking for?
Don't say anything.
Where are we going?
I'm coming with you.
Yes. Yes, come with me!
I brought you some letters. It's really fan mail. Women mostly. One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check.
You bring the cigarettes?
...delusions and paranoia.
I was all of these.
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently. No question about that.
What about Oleg?
Disappeared. They're looking everywhere. Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
No, he is here. Shit...
Don't worry about him. Think about yourself.
What about my movie rights? Book rights?
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
What's your cut? How much?
I would say...half. Half is fair.
No. No way.
But it's...
Thirty-percent. No more. Or I call another lawyer. This is the biggest case of your life. Don't try to negotiate. Thirty percent. Say yes or no.
This is not about money, Emil. I need your trust in me.
What else do you need?
I need to know about your background. I need to know about your upbringing. Why you're here.
Tell me about yourself. What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.
My father always degraded me. Killed my self-esteem. And my mother was blind.
Your mother was blind?
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
Back in the Czech Republic?
Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind. And my father blamed me for her blindness...
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
That's what he did to me. He put cigarettes out on me.
Your father put cigarettes out on you?
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
I'm abused. Don't you think?
...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...
...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her. His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.
Alright. That's a justifiable homicide.
Now I become custody of police department?
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
I will if they don't send me back.
Are you married?
Divorced.
I can't take you to my place.
The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.
So...the station is empty?
You considered becoming a prostitute?
Yes, I considered it.
Did you ever turn tricks before?
No.
What about back home?
I came here. I had no money. I knew no one. I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money. I considered it, but... it's not who I am. They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.
So you were never a prostitute?
What are you asking me?
I'm not a whore. I'm not a whore.
I know.
You don't know. I'm sorry. I was desperate. That's not me. I shot a cop. Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
They're not gonna send you right back.
Are you alright?
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
Is he your boyfriend?
Ludwig? He's gay - are you jealous?
If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process. Eddie recommended one.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
You better get packed.
Do you have coffee?
In the kitchen.
I'll make some for us.
What are you doing?
Forget about me. You have enough problems of your own.
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
I don't want to drag you down with me.
I told your partner, I can't help. I didn't see anything.
C'mon, start at the beginning. You know these people?
Tamina was a friend of mine. My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out. Better if it comes from you.
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
Are you here illegally? Don't worry about that. We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.
A cop?
I'm from a small town in Slovakia. Like the South here. The Police is right, a civilian is wrong. So I fled.
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
Oh.
It was my decision, not his.
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference. How about that? The case is all yours.
Oh yeah...? Alright.
I'm ready to be briefed. Excuse us.
Who did cause and origin?
Who do you think, Chief?!
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?
Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.
What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
I let her take a shower.
A shower!? Did you take one, too?
No! Nothing happened.
Chief - mind if I take her?
The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image! This is going to be our Rodney King!
What was I supposed to do? The guy tried to mug me. I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
Forgot? You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
End my career?
How are you going to fight this? Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight. You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do! Gimme your shield.
But Chief? Over this??
Don't you guys understand? It's all about image. The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime.
Yeah, right.
What was that, Korfin?
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief. As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
Yeah. He finished awhile ago.
Alright. Swing by her apartment. Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street. You got that?
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
Vodka tonic.
It was freaky, I'll tell you. Stupid kid.
I'm gonna propose.
When?
Tomorrow. At lunch.
What's he looking for?
Where is she?
Takin' a bath.
Any I.D.?
Sorry...PD only.
Only one guys checked in?
Yeah.
The other side of the street. The guy with the videocamera. Don't look - put her in the car. Stay this side.
Are you hit?
He got my gun! Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
Who's there?
Police. We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I have nothin' to say. If you wanna contact my attorney...
What's wrong?
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
Yeah. He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...? Poor girl...
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
No.
Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.
What are you saying?
He said he was her cousin. I told him where she works. They were just here.
Describe him.
Tall, short-haired, scary eyes. Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build. And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
He had a videocamera? Where is she? Quickly!
Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine? It gives us somethin' to do.
You know what that is, right?
No, what is it?
It's your crime scene now. You can do what you want.
Watch the news?
Nah, I musta missed it.
Well, just so you know. I gave you guys the credit.
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
Nah, why should you?
I don't even watch TV.
Did you get a report from the M.E.?
Sure. But I would like to ask you something. You got a problem with me?
If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too. What about the report?
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
Pretty.
Hmmmm.
Maybe you don't care about that either. Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
What would you call her?
Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message. Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe. It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.
Eastern Europe. Like what? Romania? Hungary?
I'll come with you.
There wasn't a fire. There'll be nothing for you to do.
I can watch you, Eddie. Maybe I'll learn something.
This isn't homicide school.
My parents are from Poland. I can help with the Eastern European angle.
You're Polish?
My folks are.
You goin' to the escort service?
You got any better ideas?
Mind if I ride along with you?
This has nothing to do with your fire.
I'll let you know what happens.
This is ridiculous. I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me. If you don't win, you don't come.
Two heads.
Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon. Ludwig's.
You thirsty?
I'm on duty.
So am I. Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
Of course.
Hey! I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid. I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
What are you hiding? Why are you afraid
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
Why not?
She's fucked. Even if that story is true.
Look - let me talk to her. Any leads I get, they're all yours. Just let me have a first crack at her.
You wanna talk to her alone?
Yeah.
What would your girlfriend think of that?
I don't have a girlfriend.
My point exactly.
I'm serious here.
So am I.
C'mon. You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity. She sees me differently.
You're her Savior? Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a head start. You take her to the station house. Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left.
Hey. I'm a professional.
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
Yeah, just her in the shower. Nothing happened. Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...
No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it. I mean, to say the least, you outta know better. You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over. You can deny it all you want, but it will
I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.
Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not. Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody? I mean, you shoulda heard her there. Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
Why'd you help me back there with the Chief? Why'd you stand up for me like that?
So...who's Nicky?
What do you want?
Your opinion. You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie. And write books.
What's your accomplishment.
I kill someone famous.
Then do it, asshole.
So tabloids don't have to do re enactments. They going to have real movie this time.
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit? How fuckin' stupid are you?
Detective, does it look like a murder?
We don't know that yet. It's much too early. There's a lot to be done.
How many victims are up there?
There are two bodies found at this point.
Can we go up to the crime scene?
You know you can't do that. C'mon.
Is it drug related?
Detective - can you tell us what happened here?
I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you. Is this somehow related to the fire department?
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
Okay. But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
He was hurt, but not seriously. He'll be fine.
Do you have the suspect in custody?
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt. He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
Eddie, are you okay?
Yeah. Now's not a good time.
Alright.
Alright?
Alright.
Alright.
Hey, honey.
What is your problem? Why'd you snap at me? I just wanted a statement.
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues. You could give me something.
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I embarrass you, sweetheart? Oh...
Stop it.
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
Alright, alright, Eddie. Don't patronize me.
I'm not.
Yes you are. I'm not just some reporter. I don't just stick a microphone in your face. You could give me something.
Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence. That was...
That was good. You were holding the evidence.
You were merciless. You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that? Huh?
You're ruthless.
Look at this. You have blood on your shirt. Whose is it?
Could be Leon's.
Don't worry about the damn phone. I won't answer it.
Answer the phone.
No. Tell me what you want to say.
Answer it.
Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor. They want me to anchor tonight!
That's good.
Yeah.
Well, that's great.
Okay. That is great. But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.
No. Go ahead. You're gonna be great.
No. No, listen to me here. I want to know what you're talking about. You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and...
I'll tell you tonight. Let's do it tonight. As soon as you get back we'll talk. We'll talk.
Promise?
I promise. We'll talk. You'll be great. You'll be fine. Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.
Yeah. I'll do that. As long as you're not patronizing me.
Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
Okay, til tonight.
Tonight.
You promise?
Yeah. I promise.
Okay. And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
Yeah, yeah. Good thing.
Okay.
See you later. Good luck.
Thank you.
So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go. I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car. I go to get the cigar and BOOM! All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go. Right where I was standin'. That coulda been it. I
Sooner or later that's everybody.
Not chopped up. Not chopped up like that. I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles. A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
How old are your kids?
So what's unique?
He's from Antigua. His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party. Stabbed her with a beer bottle.
That's unique.
I hope this prick doesn't run. My knees are killing me. Stay behind me.
Ready?
Keep them out of my way.
Okay. You ready?
Any chance we can do that again?
Okay. You work in a vodka factory. I understand that. And what kind of work do you do?
I am butcher.
You're a butcher? What do you use pig intestines for?
You stuff sausage in it.
And what do you do with the bones?
Are you married?
Come to 45 Broadway. Don't bring the Police. Come alone or you'll be in my next film.
Look asshole. I've been threatened by better than you.
No. I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
We'll talk about that. Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank. Three hundred thousand dollars.
What? It doesn't work that way.
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show. And they will show it.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Were you a fireman? That how you knew how to rig the apartment?
My father was. He gave me many lessons about fire. Now it's my friend.
You can't kill me. You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun. I bet you never shot anybody in your life.
C'mon. Pull the trigger. Do it. Oh, look, you're sweating. You don't have the balls.
Where's your partner?
Tell him to put his gun down!
Let her go! Let her go!!
Hi, I'm Honey.
Where's Czech girl?
Now I like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure. Why don'tchya put my money on the dresser.
It's an outcall service run out of an apartment. I don't meet the other girls. Aren't you gonna get undressed?
Where is escort service?
That's confidential. Could you put the money on the dresser?
I like to talk to the person who runs the service. Can you give me address?
Listen to me. I don't want sex. Just give me the address and then you go.
Give me the address!!
Next. Could I see your documents, please?
What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?
Two weeks holiday.
How much money are you carrying with you?
I have five-hundred dollars.
Is he with you? Are you travelling together?
Yes.
Please join us. Come on forward.
Is there a problem?
We are both from Prague.
How long are you planning to stay?
Two weeks.
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
Who is he?
This all you want?
Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
In here, says he wants a million.
Million?! The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview. And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her? It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?
Just do what I do. Say the same thing I say. Don't open your mouth.
Don't fool around.
Did you hear what I said?
Look. Times Square. Just like in the movies!
Don't speak Russian!
Why? Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
Look. New videocameras. Color viewfinder. Image stabilization. Solarization. Night vision.
Turn that off! Get the bags.
Why should I carry your bag? I am not a dog.
What?
Turn that fucking thing off!
Speak English!
You said speak Czech!
How you erase this?
Whore?
Get in the bathroom!
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
Gotta light the scene better. Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN.
Shut up.
Oh, shit. I hate looking at that!
What is it?
The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
I did.
And the whore's murder? You didn't erase that either, did you? Don't lie, I won't be angry.
Why not?
What is that?
Let me get a shot of it.
Sit down!
No. We are insane. Who else but crazy men would film their murders? So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there? Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted. We see psychiatrists. They must certify we are sane and because of your - what
Okay. He has nothing to say. Start the camera!
You are success story? I am success story! Why do you say I and not we?
In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?
I'm serious.
This is my project. I say 'action.' I am the director! You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.' And 'action!'
I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!
Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?
Because I am the director. Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
I'm serious...this - this is a great American film. Full of violence and sex. And I want my credit.
Credit?
Yes. Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
You got that?
No, I don't get that!
Traitor!!
Emil???!
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
Did you hurt her?
Take your eyes off her, Oleg! Look. It wasn't my fault you two were caught. It's his fault. Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?! I wasn't going to wait!!!
We spent it!
Ha. Ha.
I can get you a job.
A job?
Yes, the money is good.
As a plumber?!
It's easy to learn.
A job?? As a plumber??? You think I come to America to work!
We started over, you can too.
Robert...?
What are you doing here?
You've got a call.
I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy! I can't talk business. Hang up. Have a drink. Get her a whiskey.
Viewer discretion advised!
Isn't he a little moody?
Of course he's moody. He thinks he's in love.
Yeah?
And you, you'll pay for what you did!
You outta be ashamed. Ashamed of yourself.
If I didn't put it on somebody else would! I was his friend!
I know.
What do you mean you know? He told you he was gonna propose to me?
Well, he...
I want to hear everything he said.
I'm trying to tell you.
Alright. Go ahead.
That morning. He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
Yes...he's my friend.
I speak English.
Then answer my questions. Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
New York.
Yes, we're in New York now. But where are you planning to stay in New York?
A cheap hotel.
What are you coming here to do?
I'm here for movies.
Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?
Yes. No. Both. When I was a boy, I see movie at school called "It's a Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free. Home of the brave. A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white.
No. Go ahead.
So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?
That's what it looks like to me.
And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other? You got to hand it to them.
What was that?
I'll take him.
No way! He's mine!
We're takin' him. Don't argue!
He's my collar!
Well, he killed my partner!
Got any spare change? How 'bout a spare twenty?
Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
Okay, you're under arrest! Now you happy?
Fire Department? Firemen don't carry guns.
I'll send a cop back for you.
You okay?
A dog pissed on me!! I'm gonna sue you for this! You violated my civil rights!
What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter.
Yeah, I'm religious. I'm not an Atheist like you! Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
How did you start the fire this time?
I used an accelerant.
Yeah? What kind?
Where you been, man? We got a celebrity!
I heard. Who the hell let them up there?
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
You see anything in the crowd? Anybody suspicious?
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
Oh yeah, why?
Nah, not at all. Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin. My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.
Mouth's clean, too.
Clean?
The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out. Let it run.
You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer? Wish I had a picture of it.
He knew all along.
What??
What?
Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.
Yeah?
-- From Czechoslovakia? And how long have they been livin' in your building? Alright, I'll be in touch when we know somethin'. Milos and Tamina Karlova. They were quiet and kept to themselves. Landlord don't know who your girl is.
How long they been livin' here?
You go home. I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.
Aren't you tired?
Bobby, Bobby! Where're you hit?!
It hurts. Aw, Jesus!
How was it?
Get outta here!
What the hell happened?
Room was registered to a Francis Capra.
Capra? That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
What are you gonna do?
Don't you get it? He knew he was gonna get caught! That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.
Take the car. Get outta here, Tommy.
Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
This had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who, as you know, made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor.
Your doctor?
Yes. My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible. My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of. How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
Look, I'm a victim here, too. I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate. My life has been permanently disrupted.
Permanently disrupted? Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money? Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?
Look, I'm in here. You call this a career move?
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
We're in negotiations, that's correct.
But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?

Hi. Frank... coming in, please.
Right. Just a sec.
Okay.
Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.
Sure, what is it?
Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
What's up?
It's about my salary cheques.
Yes?
That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18.
Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
Really.
Yes.
Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.
It's possible.
Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
I suppose the idea was specialized training.
I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
Oh?
Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.
That seems very unlikely.
Yes, I thought so.
Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
How?
Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.
Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
But not completely inconceivable?
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
I guess it isn't.
Well, that's something.
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
Good morning. How's it going?
Are you reasonably awake?
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
You're kidding.
I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
Two more.
Hal?
It's the last one.
I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.
I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
I guess not.
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.
Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.
What is it, Hal?
The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.
Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something.
Sure, Dave, what's up?
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
Yes, I know.
You probably also know that we found them okay.
I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong.
Hal, is there anything bothering you? Anything that might account for this problem?
Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history.
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
Well, don't worry about it.
And don't you worry about it.
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
Yes, it is, Hal.
Too bad about Frank, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.
The antenna has to be replaced.
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.
I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.
Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
I am prepared to do that anyway.
I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.

I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?
I'm having a party tomorrow.
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
Are you coming to my party?
No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.
When are you coming home?
One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
Where is Mrs. Brown?
She's in the bathroom.
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
How many days until you come home?
Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.
Thank you, Daddy.
I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
Yes, Daddy.
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Oh, thank you very much.
Thank you.
Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
And your charming little daughter?
Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
Oh, that's such a delightful age.
How is gregor?
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?
No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.
How do you do, Mr. Miller?
Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Yes, very pleasant.
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Yes, I think so. Just about then.
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.
Are you quite sure?
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean.
Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
Really?
Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.
You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
That's right.
Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
Fortunately, they did.
Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?
Certainly.
This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.
Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
Any clue as to what it is?
But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
Any ideas about the colour?
Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
When do we arrive at Clavius?
We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
Thank you.
Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
What do you mean?
Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
I see.
Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her.
I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?
No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false.
I will if I can, Frank.
Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
True.
Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
That's true.
Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
That's true
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
That's true.
Hal, have pod arms secure the component.
Five by five, Frank.
Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.
I understand.
Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.
Roger.
Pod Bay is decompressed. All doors are secure. You are free to open pod bay doors.
Yes, Hal, what's up?
I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure.
Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?
Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
Yeah?
Name?
This is three years old.
We don't wash 'em, ya know.
How about chargin' the battery?
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
Yeah.
Vodka.
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
Now how's your memory doin'?
Fuck off. I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
I don't give a damn about his girl...
I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.
Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto.
I want to drive awhile.
I ain't tired yet.
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
Whaddya mean, buy?
Pay money?
Yeah, dummy. Money.
I never paid for it in my life.
It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it. I never paid for it in my life.
Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.
Hey, what about me?
I'm candy...
Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust. You interested?
Hey, what kind of talk is that?
Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.
Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?
You're in a hurry.
Yeah, i been waiting three years.
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...
What's the matter with my place?
Well, maybe I'll see you later ...
Hello, again.
Here you go, baby.
Hey, don't do that. I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
I'll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco...how'd that be? Then we'll go dancin', okay?
I said police. Now drop the goddamn gun.
How about it?
I hear you've got visitors.
Would you guys...
You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls...
Yeah. Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
You're gonna help us take him.
No chance.
Where's ganz?
You lying son of a bitch...
After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever...
I don't think you're gonna make it.
I got hit. I can't believe it. I got shot.
You're done. End of story.
You got a name, cop?
Try Cates. And let's talk in private, okay?
You here to write my life story?
Yeah, I noticed...
Ganz is in jail. He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
Yeah?
I can deliver Ganz. But you gotta get me outta here first.
You're crazy.
I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out. I got to be on the street. Get me outta here.
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
I got a lot to protect.
Bullshit.
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
This prison gives out $400 suits?
We're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers...
I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
Hey, no way. Take off the bracelets or no deal.
You just don't get it, do your Reggie? There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
No way to start a partnership.
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead. And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Yeah.
Okay, let's get down to it. I did my part and got you out. So now you tell me where we're goin'?
Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit. We go to him right away.
Luther was part of the gang?
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
I don't give a damn. It happens to be my name.
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
Just up the street, the other side, over there ... Now, don't bother knockin' on the door. Luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company.
Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man.
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
Hey, this works pretty good.
Thank you.
What do you think?
I think you better put him on ice, man.
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim. And you fucked' it up.
Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.
Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
We eat when I say we eat.
Bullshit ... I ain't moving till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here. If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye. And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?
Now, where we goin', convict?
I don't give out the details.
Last night.
Sure. Then we had a fight this morning.
Well?
It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
Back you up? Now why would I wanna do that?
If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...
Hey, you wanna bet?
I got two problems. Number one, I'm not playin' games. Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
Why? Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.
What are you talkin' about?
You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail. And whatever it is, you're part of it.
I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.
This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.
You made that move, huh?
There.
Must be billy's girl.
Let's go.
This sucks. A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. So, instead of me being where I oughta be, which is in bed giving my girl the high, hard one, I'm out here doing this shit, roaming around with some overdressed, charcoal-colored loser like you.
You wanna leave, man? Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
You? Don't make me laugh. You can't take care of shit. You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt. All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
Maybe I don't like the way you ask.
Yeah, right. You want to try again?
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
They saved your ass, convict.
I been waiting a long time for some money.
How much?
Half a million.
Just tell me about the money.
Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
He's after your money.
We split 50-50?
Not likely, convict.
You gonna let me keep any of it?
Where's the money?
Right, partner.
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Where's the goddamn car?
This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.
...For three years? Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.
I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time.
Not really. I figured Ganz was put down for a long time. And I knew Luther would never job me on his own. He's too chickenshit.
What?
Musta got some primo bondsman.
Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash?
Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd just leave town.
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...
I let women get to me. The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em. Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money. They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money...
A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row...
You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.
What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
No class...
We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?
That was in style a couple years back, man.
Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
You stay with me...
Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took you so long to call, man? I been waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's... 'Course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers.
Where's luther?
Be polite. Say hello. This is Candy.
What about Luther?
We missed.
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the "Don't Disturb" sign. He's trading his girl for the money. All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind.
Tell me something. Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?
I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...
Thanks for callin' in... and I guess Maybe... Look, I'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin' on ya, doin' my job.
Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
Yeah, I see her.
That was quick.
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
Why?
Notice something funny about that bus?
Hey, how'd my car get here?
I had it impounded. Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
Back to jail in my own car. Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.
Naw, you didn't let me down. It was a long shot all the way. We gave 'em a good run at it.
It's late, they're closing...
Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend. I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him...
Do I get to kiss her too?
What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit? I mean, they could be in Rio de Janeiro.
Hey, there she is...
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine. You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
Partnership?
You okay?
Yeah. But I wasn't there for a second.
Okay, reggie, start bustin' my chops... Tell me how great you were with that chick.
Wait a minute, Cates. I've been waitin' three years for that. I don't think it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand.
It's your money. It'll be here in six months when you get out.
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
Thanks.
I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.
Hey, the bastard's got my gun. I want it back.
Yeah...
Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
Yeah. It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
Okay. You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine. Nail this guy and make us all look good. But you better watch your ass. If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
Jack?
Yeah?
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
What the bell happened?
I lost them, that's what happened.
How did they get away?
Which one pulled the trigger?
The Indian. I was about 30 yards away.
What a screw-up.
Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?
I didn't have the time.
He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with.
Where the Christ do you think you're going?
That's what you say, Cates...
Yeah.
But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report.
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure? Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?
Every last bit of it. The big guy's room was empty.
This guy must have had a .44 like yours, Jack. Now he's got yours.
Billy Bear...
Who are all these?
They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
Tell me that's not the same guy.
I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking. Can we find them?
Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
You look awful.
So do you...been a long day.
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
Doesn't look like it.
Nothing came in for me yet? No calls?
Bullshit red tape.
I got to wait for a call.
I almost forgot. That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him.
Jesus Christ. Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
A cop...
I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie.
I think I met her. Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
He ... he wants me to help him skip town.
When? How?
What am I wanted for?
I don't think your gun's loaded...
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
Hey, you're right.
You're hopeless.
I'm all wet.
A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
What'd you do?
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
I guess he got the message...
Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch. I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
Hey, you know what I really think?
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
You know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put on a clean shirt in the morning.
Maybe you ought to buy me one.
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
When you start with that attitude... it's like I don't know who you are.
What do you want to know? What difference does it make? I'm the guy in your bed the last three months. I make you feel good. You make me feel good. What the hell else do you want from a guy?
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
That's the way I see it, too.
Call me later.
You sure you want me to?
Thanks for the coffee.
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
Great place for lunch.
Yeah, one of my favorites.
Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day...
Jack, are you okay?
Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...
Bullshit? I'll tell you about bullshit. My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it. It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop. It's not a practical way to function...
I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility. I like to get the job done right. And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
That's right. I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him. Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
Just one. Some lady called. Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....
Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?
I'm at work, asshole. Where else?
Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
No wonder you're so popular.
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
The number ... what's the Goddamn number?
Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...
Jack, wait...
Hello.
Hi, it's me...
Hey, I don't believe it.
Hiya, kid.
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
Don't. We've had a hard night.
I can see that. Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit. What happened?
You real down?
Nothing. No sign of Ganz. No sign of the Indian. Airport's clean. Train station. Bus station. Docks... Shit...
Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
How do you know?
What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions. I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
So what?
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
Whaddya think?
What do I know? I'm just a bartender.
How'd they take it back at headquarters?
Usual bullshit. You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
Three more hours...
Where is he?
Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
Tell me.
You're impossible...
Who the hell are you?
I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.
Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years. And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
Hard man to live with.
How would you know?
Hey, two days with him is enough.
He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you...
Hey...
Shut up.
What do you want? What's goin' on?
Stall.
Keep stallin'.
How hot are they?
How ya doin'?
Can't complain.
We got a lot to talk about.
Yeah, old times.
We'll follow you. Take it slow,okay?
Surprise, Luther.
Whaddya want? I thought you were locked up-
I want the money, asshole, what do you think? The money that Reggie hid...
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Instead of worryin' about Reggie, you better worry about me...
Don't give me this, we were partners.
Billy, go ahead, break it...
No! Don't kill her. I can get you the money.
When?
I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
You chickenshit punk...
Come on, you can trust me. Please.
Let her go.
Rosalie, you okay?
How you doing, man?
You want to go outside?
You sure?
How about some ammo?
How much?
This is clean shit. No serial numbers and never been used...
Don't mess with me. How much?
Five bills.
Five. On credit.
Yeah, I know that, but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it?
Give it back.
Fuck you. You got no right for this kind of play.
Appipulai Leeloo Minai..

What're you laughing about?
The case..with the stones... Where is it?

...We're saved!
Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
Why? What's wrong with me?
...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.
...would you like a drink?
No thank you.
...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color. So full of..life!
Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life! So, in reality, you and I are in the same business!
Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
You are a monster, Zorg!
Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.
She's not my bride, she's my fare. She's looking for this Vito Cornelius. According to the phone guide he lives here.
That's me. But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?
Who are you?
I brought the girl remember?
He's a she!
You noticed...
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it! This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
So you do know her.
They all like this in your family, father?
She's an exception..
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
Excuse me! Just one thing! She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
It means, "Never without my permission".
I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston.
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
What kind of mission?
We have to save the world.
Good luck..
Of course.
What are you doing?
You're probably very angry with me and I quite understand. But I want you to know I'm fighting for a noble cause.
Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
Leeloo's in trouble?
When is she not in trouble?
Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?
There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.
Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.
Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!
Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
And then?
Is there anything that can stop it?
But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?
Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop? You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.
What are we going to do?
It's a miracle!!!
What is?
Father, will you please explain what's going on?
Father. You sure she's the Supreme Being?
What's she doing?
Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time..
There was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer ... Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so bad with names...
They really made her...
I got it! Everything here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
Where's Leeloo?
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
You're all safe. Thanks be to God!
You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you...
Who?
Leeloo... is... she's...
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live!
I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
Do you love her?
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
I don't have time... I need to know.
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
I'm sorry, but... the Stones...
Yeah?
I love you too Major, but you haven't called me that since basic training.
I was talking to the cat.
At least, the cat comes back.
You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.
I don't want a million - I just want one. A perfect one.
I just found a picture of you.
How do I look?
I don't need one.
You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive.
Finger! I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
How many points you got left on your license?
Uh... at least fifty.
Hello?
Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.
Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
So, just how big was this fare?
Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..
Akina delutan, nou-shan.

Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest...

...What's your name?
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.
Hey, that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
The Fifth Element...
Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
When EVIL returns so shall we.
...Hello?
You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
Hi Ma...
Are you listening to me, you ingrate!
Other than that... You all right?
I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?
I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
Yeah?
Have you pulled yourself together?
Hello?
You little sleaze bag!
...Ma???
Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..
Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
You have nine points left on your license..
I'm sorry..
30 seconds...
6... 5...
...Hi.
...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know everything there is to know about the D-man. His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of intimates. And from what I'm looking at intimate is the stud muffin's middle name. So tell me my main man... you nervous in the service?
I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio. So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a hand, that clear pal?
My main man! Please don't leave me here alone. My head's killing me and my adoring fans are gonna tear me apart! Get me outta here!
I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own.
Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right, man. Tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams...
I don't think this is a good time...
...You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose?
Yeah, very big, a giant.
You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it?
Six to the left. One to the right.
He's on vacation.
Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?
Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your time here?
You know how to fly this thing?
I don't even know what I'm looking for!
Solid little jobs, aren't they?
What did you say? What did you do?
Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
Is that all?
Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance.
What mission?
To save the world.
Where have I heard this song before?
You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'?
Just one... why me?
Two: Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated.
And the third one?
Don't you open your messages?
I've had enough good news for today
You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
I'm not going.
Why not?
...Shit!
It's my wife.
I thought you were divorced.
...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back.
Three of us will never fit in there!
Apipoulai!
Valo massa... Chacha hamas.
You hear that?
Cornelius..
Dinoine chagantakat!
Apipoulai!
Love...
Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience..
Finished what?
Learning language.
Which one?
You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
Apipoussan!
Apipoussan?
Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?
Uh...
Here we go again...
You know women normally change five times more than men.
You get that off the screen?
Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
You noticed..
Where you going?
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate.
And you can't concentrate with me around?.
You're nothing but a... a...
I'm so very sad.
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
I told you not to read all that crap!
Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?
The wind blows... the fire burns...
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
It's up to you now, Angel!
I'm so tired...
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
I want to sleep... forever...
What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them!
You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
...Like love...
Exactly.
I have thousands of memories but none of them are mine... There is no need for me other than this. I'm immortal but I have no life.
Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
Why?... Why would you need me?
Tell me...
Not going to open?
I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
The last two messages I got? The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
At least I won lunch.
The cash man!
Been here long?
Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model?
Uh..
It's not?
Thanks..
This is all that survived?
Actually only one cell survived..
Have you identified it?
It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
Talk English Doc.
This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless..
Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react, to protect themselves. That means growing skin. Clever, eh?
This thing solid?
Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.
I managed to contact the Mondoshawan. They deplore the incident, but accept our apologies.
And the Stones? Did you find them in the wreckage?
The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.
I want your best man on this!
They just landed in the desert.
Staedert, do you read me?
Is that better?
Perfect, Mr. President.
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..
Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!
Options.
Wait or act.
Recommendations.
My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
Staedert? What's going on? Did you destroy it?
Lord forgive me.. they already know too, much..
"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."
Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications.
A weapon against evil. Amazing! I am going to be famous.
Drink!
How's that? Can you hear me better now?
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
Yes, Sir!
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
Am I disturbing you?
...Not far, now.
Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?
Got it.
How's our deal coming along?
The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!
Welcome home.
What's this... have you been smoking... ?
Smoking? I'm not smoking.
Your clothing reeks of it.
You know, Amy, I've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... I mean, is this what I get first thing? Before you even "hello," you accuse me... ?
I'm not accusing you...
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
Okay, I believe you.
How's the detective business?
Business was fine. I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
I love you.
You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?
Sure. I'll call the guy.
You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
I'm not using him again for anything. He was worthless. You have bridge here Saturday?
This is the mortgage. This is Cindy's college money.
I understand.
Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing. It's better that way.
I know.
It's a missing persons case... a long shot. I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back. We'll take a vacation.
Why the gun?
Hello?
Amy, it's me. Listen very carefully..
Amy, just listen. Take Cindy and get out of the house. Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...
What's wrong? Are you alright?
I'm okay. Please, honey, I can't explain. Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out. I'm on my way. I'll be back at the house in three hours. Call me from the hotel when you get there
... What's going on?
What happened to you?
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay. Are you alright?
What's going on, Tom? What happened?
I can't tell you, Amy. You know I can't. You have to trust me...
Tom...
Why haven't you called? Why don't you answer your phone?
I don't know. I'm sorry...
You owe me an explanation. You can't treat me like this.
I wanted to call. I couldn't.
You couldn't?
You don't understand...
No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!
You should have.
Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
Look where we are. Look at yourself. You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
I don't know what to say
You're killing me...
Don't...
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
Who are you calling?
Mrs. Christian.
What?
She's all I've got. She's the only witness.
She died in her sleep three days ago. It was in the paper...
What are these?
Anything harder?
There's nothing harder.
Snuff?
What you see is what I got, mister.
You know where I can get it? I have a lot of money to spend.
What do you want?
I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
What are you talking about?
The loop! The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?! This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...
Bullshit.
I'm telling you...
Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible. Why are you bothering me with this... ?
Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt. Think about it. There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything. I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.
Dino...
What the fuck... !
It's an honor to meet you. Thank you for seeing us.
I'd like to commission a work. I'm a great admirer of yours.
Flattering. And, who's your colorful little chum?
A fellow investor.
You said something about money.
That's five thousand dollars.
Is it?
Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course. Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
And they are?
I want to watch you work.
I'll consider it.
And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
Machine.
He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.
We can do that.
You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it. I'd like to take your picture. You don't mind?
I'd rather you didn't.
What's the problem?
I'm camera shy.
You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
I'll do this for you. Fifteen thousand dollars.
Machine's in?
Where's that?
You brought the money?
Excellent.
Where are the women?
What are these for?
Hmm? Oh, the knifes? They're just props. Nice, aren't they?
Mister Welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person?
What are you... ?
Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.
Look, I don't know what this...
You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?
Friend of yours?
Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
I'll get it. It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...
Is that him?
Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max.
You're a dead man.
Leave him alone.
... sorry...
You got the guts, tough guy? Gonna kill us all, is that it?
What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?
Call me Tom.
Alright, Tom.
What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive. And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...
There are reasons for the way we do things here.
Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife. What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe. They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city. Nice kid, mature, didn't
Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
I figured you share information.
We do.
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
Why don't they come to me?
This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved. They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever. Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.
I'm not so sure about this.
They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance. We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.
Any good?
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days. I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
Celebrity Films.
Eddie.
Yeah, who's this?
I know what you did.
What?
I know what you did.
Who is this.
You murdered that girl, Eddie. Six years ago...
What the fuck are you.. ?
What's he talking about?
I'm gonna kill you.
Don't bore me with that bullshit.
Don't ask questions.
Starting to recognize a pattern?
What do you want?
Who is Machine?
I don't know...
I want his name.
I told you, I don't know.
I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.
Okay, we'll come back to that. So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it. It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.
Yeah, the fucking lawyer.
Told him you could get him a snuff film.
Yeah.
How much did he pay you?
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
That's all? Thirty each. That's all it took for you to murder her?
So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine. And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models. And she never walked out.
Something like that.
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
What the fuck do you want from me?
I want to know. I want to know exactly what you did to her!
Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.
Why?
I don't know. I felt like it. I never saw anyone get done before.
You enjoy it?
Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that. It was just something I was doing for money.
Tell me what happened.
What do you want to know? You saw it, you saw the loop...
Nobody saw you bring her in?
There wasn't nobody around. This place was a shit-hole. I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries. Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.
What did you do with her body?
Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
Keep moving.
You can't go to the cops. All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...
Stop talking.
You got absolute zero.
Show me where you buried her.
I don't know... ... out there somewhere.
Where? Show me where.
Do it.
Don't think I won't.
Do it! Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore. You think it's so easy?
Easy enough for you.
I never killed anyone.
That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it." Almost makes you worse.
You know how my tapes sell. People eat this stuff up.
I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month. Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?
The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie. Where do you get this stuff?
Look, you cocksucker...
Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head. Till then, fuck you.
Yes, I do have something to say. I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.
I'm listening.
As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
Of what sort?
You are a private investigator?
That's right.
You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself.
Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.
So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy. And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film. That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
That's trust. Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything. Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.
I was well compensated.
That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me. You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe. How'd you find me?
Never mind how I found you.
Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
They're no friends of mine.
Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone. If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago. A girl no one even remembers.
You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one. Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one...
Shut up.
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
Shut your mouth and drive!
You're making me very angry.
Just tell me. Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really? What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
You're asking me why?
A man like Mr. Christian, a great man... all his money, all his power... a man who attained everything there was to attain...
Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?
Isn't it incredibly obvious?
Enlighten me.
You almost went over your limit.
Give me the film.
Give me the film.
He's lying.
Big date tonight?
Yeah... guess so.
Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
Pardon me?
My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
Once you pick it up you can't put it down.
Truman Capote.
I tear off the cover and paste this one on... You know how it is.
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
Remember me?
I need some information. Thought you might be able to help.
I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight.
How long you been working there?
Three, four years.
What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
Max.
Well, here's the deal, Max. This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...
There's not much illegal.
Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know. I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great. If not, speak now.
You're not a cop, are you? If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.
I'm not a cop.
You're a private eye. Like Shaft.
Not quite.
From Pennsylvania. P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.
How much?
How much do you make now?
Four hundred a week, off the books.
Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
Sounds good, pops.
Here's my number if you need it... When can you start?
Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
... Hello... ?
You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc. Nobody even considers them pornography anymore. Then, there's mainstream hardcore. Triple X. The difference is penetration. That's hardcore. That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are. They pump out 150 videos a week. A week. They've even got a porno Academy Awards. America loves pornography. Anybody tells you
Interesting theory.
What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend. We're talking about stuff where people get hurt. Specialty product.
Child pornography.
There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal. Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal. This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love. Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.
Snuff films.
I heard you asking. That guy wasn't yanking you around. There's no such thing.
What other ways are there to get illegal films? Who do you see?
How old are you?
Twenty-five.
Where are your parents?
I don't know, where are yours?
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed. What are you talking about?
You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.
Yeah, I'm a real genius. What choices have I got? Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it. I work a job. It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb. So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver? Go to Harvard? Run for President? What about you, pops?
What about me?
I see a ring on your finger. You have any kids?
A daughter.
So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?
Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo.
A weirdo making S+M films? Who'd have thought it?
His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore. Definitely not for the squeamish.
Specialty product.
You're learning.
Where does he sell it?
Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look. He'll also do commissions, for enough money...
Nothing illegal, it's always borderline. Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
Alright, I get the picture.
He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art.
Well, I'm in New York now. What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?
I'm a working stiff, pops.
Take a vacation. I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
You want me to come out there and play private eye?
Consider it. Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts. I'll call back.
You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.
It's their Presidential Suite.
Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this flea bag?
Wha... ?
Who is he?
I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...
Who is he, his name?
You don't need to be here.
I know if I had to pick, it'd be "Choke," or "Devil."
What's next?
I'm trying to figure that out myself. I have to see Machine without his mask.
Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
What's this?
Look... that's awful generous and everything...
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
Uh huh, pleasure.
Have a pleasant evening. Will you have tea, Mister Welles?
He's odd.
I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey. Asking about you. I must say you have friends in influential places.
I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
As you know, my husband passed away recently. Two weeks ago now.
My condolences.
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma. A terrible, terrible dilemma.
Pittsburgh?
Mostly. That's where he started his empire building. He was a good man. Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated. He wanted to be legendary.
He succeeded.
Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?
I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to. Other than that, there's never any reason.
My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe. I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business. Not till now, that is.
You hired someone to open it. I'll bet the lawyer loved that.
There was nothing he could do. My husband left everything to me. I prevented anyone from seeing the contents. I felt these were my husband's private things. I didn't... I didn't realize...
Do you want to tell me what you found?
It's a film... of a girl being murdered.
I'm afraid I don't...
I didn't know what to think. I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband. To know that he watched this... this atrocity. But, I can't go to the police...
Please, believe me. This is probably a stag film. Simulated rape. Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects...
No.
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
I'm telling you it's not that.
I'm sure it is. It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke. More than likely he never even watched it.
Will you watch it and see for yourself?
You... you need to go to the police.
I told you I can't, not yet.
You don't have any other choice.
No. For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police. I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...
It won't work like that.
I deal in divorce cases. Corporate investigations...
You've found missing persons before.
Nothing remotely like this.
Okay...
My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.
I'm not positive this means anything.
One was for two hundred thousand, one dollar and thirteen cents. Another was for three hundred thousand, six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents...
Okay, I follow you so far...
Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.
You're joking.
Hello... ?
I'm here.
Do you think the film could have cost that much?
For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations. Who knows? It sure could have. I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.
Okay.
Send it to me through the post office like we arranged. No return address. You dug this up all by yourself?
You told me to look, so I looked.
Hello?
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
How are you? Having any luck?
I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
I've been ordered into bed. The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
I hope it's nothing serious.
Nothing more than a bother. Have you any news for me?
I've made progress. I'm in Manhattan. Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.
I've got about five thousand left in cash, but I'll need another thirty, if you approve.
How will I get it to you?
Yes... ?
I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit. If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter.
I don't understand, who are... ?
I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington. I'm sure you've dealt with them before?
Yes, but...
What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...
Neil... Neil Cole.
Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me. He didn't call?
No.
It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations. It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts. All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope.
They hired you. You're like, a private detective?
I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV.
So, she didn't leave a note? She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?
No.
She just seemed... depressed... ?
She didn't seem herself. For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it. One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone. She took some clothes.
What was she running from?
I don't know.
If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask. Your husband... he committed suicide?
Yes.
September 4th, 1993. About a year after Mary disappeared.
We were divorced by then. Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
Why do you think he did it?
It got to be too much for him.
You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter... Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never. My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
I didn't mean to...
You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.
I had to ask. I apologize.
People remember me from the news. Can you drive me back now?
I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time. Maybe we can finish tomorrow. I'll call tomorrow...
Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother. Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time. That's when you start going to church.
We're all like that.
Are you religious?
No.
I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.
What?
It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons. When kids run, they almost always leave a note. It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.
There wasn't one. The police looked.
Do you think the police did a good job?
I don't know. I think so.
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it. She might have wanted to tell you something...
No. You don't have any reason to think that...
How... how can you say that to me...?
Will you let me look?
My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...
You were right. I didn't find anything. I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?
I think about it everyday. But, every time the phone rings... every single time, I still think it's her.
It's been six years.
Hello... ?
Mrs. Mathews? It's Thomas. Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...
I remember. You just left...
What are you talking about... ?
She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...
Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead.
Who is this... ?
Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...
Who are you?
They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...
No...
He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...
No... no... no...
They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
Why... why are you doing this to me... ?
Yes... I remember Mary
You... you do? You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
Do you know what happened to her?
What is this?
Those are her belongings.
Her belongings?
Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?
She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet. Oh, I adored her. I supposed I always hoped she'd be back. After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things. Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?
Your son-in-law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day, saw that woman every night. The specifics are in the report, and information about the woman. It's unpleasant, I know. I apologize...
None too discreet, is he?
No, sir, he is not.
The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...
Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
Okay, I'll take it all.
Excellent. we accept MasterCard and American Express.
Alright. May I have your phone number, area code first?
No, you may not.
I'm required by state law to inform you that, while it's perfectly legal for you to purchase these items, it is illegal for you to use them for any sort of...
Yeah, I know the spiel. If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.
Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?
What?
The mirror. You can't see yourself in it.
Yeah. She'd be half as strict as you.
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
Rick...I can't.
Alice, you think you can leave?
What's wrong?
Kincaid and Joey died last night.
You alright?
I heard you screaming. Was it a bad one?
It was bad.
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison? This looks like Sheila's.
It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
I can't go back to sleep again.
We'll figure it out.
Figure it out?!?! I'll be insane before I figure it out. The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep. Not while he's using me.
Here you are. Where were you this morning? Rick's looking all over for you.
Have you seen Joey and Kincaid! God, I can't find them. I can't find them anywhere.
I'm sure they're around.
I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad.
My mom taught me when I was little. Did you ever hear of the dream master?
Sounds like a game show host to me.
No really, it's a fable. The 'guardian of good' dreams. It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
I daydream. you have to dream about some place fun. Remember you're in control.
How'd you learn so much about dreams?
You what?
Kristen, what happened?
You in a hurry?
I gotta get to the library before it closes. Killer physics test.
I know. I hardly have any time to study.
Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much. You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.
We have matching luggage.
You've been up all night?
That obvious, huh?
Then you saw him, too?
No...
You're his sister, right?
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen. She wasn't feeling very well.
Tell him I was looking for him, okay? I'm Dan.
I thought it was an accident. Smoking in bed.
I was there in the dream. He took her. It was awful. It was awful...
No, don't! I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!
I've been working double shifts.
Extra money, huh?
No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.
How long have you been awake?
Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?
Not really.
Is there something we can do?
You don't really get it. He's not a nightstalker. It'll take more than bench presses to beat him.
Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
Yeah, right. Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room. Adults won't see it. They can't.
Then what else can we do?
Try what other kids did. Keep each other awake. We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.
Hey, you're not alone. We have to stop him, I'm with you.
You just feel sorry for me.
As long as your driving doesn't kill us.
He's going after Debbie. I gotta stop him.
Here we are.
What the hell was that?
You look great!
Rick, please.
I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.
Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack? She was gonna be a doctor.
It was Freddy.
Enough of that crap.
T-T-Thanks Alice...
Hey, Rick!
I don't get it.
So what's up? What'd I miss?
She told us the story of Freddy. It's a town legend. He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
So?
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
Nice neighborhood.
Hey man, we're all sorry...
Been up with Alice.
How she doing? I ran into her last night.
She's blaming herself for Sheila. I know how it feels. I've been thinking about Kristen. Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
About Freddy?
Something the matter with the cuisine?
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
What's wrong with me?
I'm sorry honey, but...
Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!
Honey, we went over this in therapy.
Something wrong with the stairs?
Avoid-all-contact-day.
What?
What is it?
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
I'll tell you later.
It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.
It's okay, babe. We're with you.
Feeling better now?
Yeah. I guess so... What happened?
I gotta get out of here.
You just stay put. You need rest.
You don't get it, he's after me...
Excuse us, dear.
Frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby?
Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no. He is my responsibility.
In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --
We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.
Hey...wake up.
Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?
It's lonely in there, in my room.
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.
How did you know that?
Hi, you don't look very well. Are you feeling all right?
Is that who you're waiting for?
I don't think this is a nice place for you to be. Maybe we should go find your Mom.
She doesn't want me around
No you're not. You don't even care about being a mom. How come you don't think about me?
Who says I don't like you?
Mommy...?
Where is he?
What do you mean?
But how...?
Hi, beautiful.
Jesus! Don't do that!
The tickets.
They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris. It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
Okay, babe. What's the matter?
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
About him?
You stopped it didn't you? It was probably just a regular bad dream.
Yeah...I guess.
You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you. Or me. Or us. Remember...
You're right.
There you go. Love you.
I was afraid you weren't coming.
I watched from behind the stands. Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know. "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
That's in the past. Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
Dad!
Where are we going?
Thanks for everything, Dad.
You sure you don't want a ride to work?
I'm so sorry, honey...
How was the meeting?
Sobering...
Very funny.
Alice...
Since when are you such a smart shopper?
Since my little girl became a mom...
You disappointed in me?
Alice!
I've got to go.
No! I won't have you running around in the middle of the night. You're coming home.
But Dad --
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
Had kind of a long night.
Dan keeping you up again? Put a lock on that window, girl.
Good to see you again, Mr. Grey. I've got to go find Dan.
It was no accident. It was Krueger. He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore. He's found some other way.
Have you visited the little boy on my floor? Jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?
There aren't any little boys on your floor.
Did everyone call everyone?
What's that got to do with it?
It was just an accident. Like with Dan.
I don't understand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it?
You had me scared on the phone. What's wrong with the baby?
Oh, Alice...no. Honey, I love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself...
I really think you need to calm down now, okay?
I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you. But, you're like a locked safe. You've gotta start dealing with reality.
Krueger is reality.
And so is your baby. You've got more than just yourself to think of now!
All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman. Why don't you take off - leave Springwood and cool out somewhere for a while?
Look...we're all tired. None of us had any sleep since Friday night...
Are you alright?
You think that's the place she's buried?
What?
But how are we gonna --
You do good work, Alice.
He sure loves to stay awake.
Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.
Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.
I've got to write some of this down.
Mark, are you okay?
I want to talk to both you guys about Greta. And...
I thought about that.
Then get out!
Do you think I'm an idiot...for being in love with her?
Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit.
Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.
Who's Jacob?
My baby!
Whoa, slow down. How're you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet?
Where are you going?
I couldn't do that, Mark. He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him.
They think I'm nuts.
No, it's our problem, Mark. If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob. You said she committed suicide?
That's what the newspapers thought. She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
They couldn't prove it. No body! Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.
But I've seen her grave.
Poor woman...
I don't understand.
Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?
Next life. Oh, what's that?
Meet me later. Milkshakes. Cherry pie. Banana splits. And no mom!
That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.
He's right. Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes.
Who?
Oh man! I could've gone all night without looking at that.
These things are wild... What do you think?
All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do. I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...
Yeah...
Have another one, sounds like you need it.
Naah, I'm done. Got to be on shift in a couple hours. Aren't you going in?
Stop saying that, it's bullshit.
Look. Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard. He was bitching about it at the party last night. He was under pressure. We all are.
Bottom line, Alice. Anybody, supernatural or not, that wants to hurt you - he'll have to go through us first.
Dan. And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne. You've been practicing.
Vomit?
Why don't you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?!
Mark...
I'm not finished - I loved Greta. A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
It's okay.
You, too?
I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.' I thought it was your father.
It was supposed to be. Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
How is he - ?
It was moderate. He'll be all right. But it was out of the question, his coming along.
You could train someone else.
What is it?
Your 'out.' This came for you.
My father! He's not - ?
What did you mean: I'm 'out?'
You 'trade school boys' are all alike, aren't you? Anybody who doesn't happen to think like a little gold-braided puppet is, ipso facto, a coward!
Wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, <u>Commander</u>! It just so happens I'm <u>not</u> a coward - physical or mental - and before I'd risk my father's life...
We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
That may be. But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
Perhaps. But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit! Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!
Unidentified Flying Objects.
That's enough, Holloway. I've told you before, wearing boards on your shoulders, and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto- matically endow you with back- bone - !
However our ideas disagree, as I've said before, I'm <u>not</u> a coward! And it happens you've got no choice: Either <u>I</u> take you down there, in the Lungfish, or you don't get there -
They're so remote - cold - beautiful, the stars. But now - I wonder -
Yes?
Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all.
But if they <u>do</u>?
I don't know.
I wouldn't worry. So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -
Now, Dave Old Buddy, you know you're exaggerating - What do you think of this husband of yours? On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer. But unfortunately, in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself -
But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work. She deserves a fighting chance!
Reef!
So they caught up with you, too?
At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home. Now -
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
You've asked why I stay a bachelor? There goes the best reason I know!
Huh?
I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the Academy, didn't he?
I guess.
One of the finest men, and officers, alive. A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two. He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
So?
So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist. A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot! 'Ban the atom tests! Junk the nuclear subs! Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
But <u>they're</u> not Skipper Neilsen's son! It broke his heart. Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father' - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy. Oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish' - but it broke him, all the same.
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
Cyclops?
We're stuck tight!
You've got to let us try, Skipper --
'Us?'
You all wait here. I'm going inside, take a look.
How about that! The bow drove half through her, but she sealed herself right up.
What's more important - there's our problem. The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!
I think you're right.
Yeah?
I don't hear anything. Maybe you've been down here too long. Why don't you go back up and -
Hey - you know somethin'? It's getting lighter in here!
And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!
You hear that?
Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?
Somewhere down there?
Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
Well?
Here - keep these. It wants me to come alone.
Dave - !
Get ready. We shove off as soon as Griff reports all the crew aboard.
Is there any way out of it?
Seems to be all around...
What about down?
Course and speed?
A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing, and caught our torpedo!
What course, Skipper?
You better take Powell and Carney with you --
The frogmen?
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable. Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
Sidearms? But the saucer's dead.
Excuse me, Skipper---
Yes, Griff?
Skipper - could you take a look here...?
Something wrong?
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
Why do you say that?
We're dead in the water. But it indicates we're moving!
We read you! Go ahead, Doctor! They're inside the saucer. It's filled with breathable air!
Wonderful!
Now they feel it...down below.
Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot...
Anything ---
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
It doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?
Under <u>water</u>?
...above Murmansk, and Finland.
Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear. But suppose it isn't at all - what if it's <u>magnetic</u>?
<u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force. Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....
....in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and, as you put it.... ...'recharging his batteries'?
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!
As we near the Pole...
There's got to be an explanation!
All ready?
Thought you were going to Washington, Skipper.
I did go. Just back. Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent. My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef - You'll have to share quarters, this trip.
Who with?
'Doctor' Neilsen? When did <u>that</u> happen?
Huh?
What do you think?
Determine extent of damage, immediately.
You're sure it's Cyclops?
What's the running time?
Right <u>at</u> him?
That's what I said!
But - what can we accomplish?
A hundred and eighty fathoms! We can't be sinking that fast....
It's the screws, Skipper. At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.
Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?
What?
Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty knots!
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone!
That's a <u>face</u>???
Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -
Swell!
He did!
Why not me? What am I - the closing act?
On the contrary. I want you - unharmed - perfect.
Why?
It is a living thing. When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?
Obviously.
My yeoman will show you to your quarters.
See what?
Well, I'll be - !
Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer. 'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.
You plotted the course of Cyclops? Then that's <u>our</u> course! Wherever <u>he</u> goes, <u>we</u> go.....until we get him!
We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.
Due north. At five knots...no, six!
Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks.
You got yourself a computer, Alma.
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
Are you alright, Wade?
Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
Always has been.
This is maybe worse than you and I are used to. What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
Who?
Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.
Who?
...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age.
Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
You don't believe me?
About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.
Has anybody offered to buy it?
This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?
What is the Northcountry Development Association?
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
Twombley involved?
No.
He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
What are you boys up to?
The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news --
Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.
Yeah. I know about that.
LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?
Tell me.
Chub says you're fired.
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
I screwed up the divorce. I agreed with everything she said. I wanted her to like me. I just want to be a good father.
It would help if you were married, if there was someone at home while you work.
I plan to. Soon.
How soon?
This spring.
Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.
It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?
Yes.
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.
Oh.
You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --
You heard the news.
I hear Twombley got shot.
You see it?
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right?
Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.
Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?
He's on to us!
Shit! What are we gonna do?
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
You can't buy Wade off.
We bought you.
It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid.
Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.
Guaranteed, eh?
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks. This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
If you get it?
Yeah.
You might not kill it.
You think so.
You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
Mmm.
You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
I get it. No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.
And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
I'm okay.
I used to play ball.
Yeah?
Drafted by the Red Sox.
You played for the Sox?
Double A. New Britain.
Oh.
Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."
Really.
They said.
Hmm.
The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck.
What happened?
Safety on?
Yeah.
This way.
Sun's gettin high.
Fresh tracks. Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck, Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around.
Don't mind if I do.
LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
No brag. Just fact.
I thought I told you to move that truck!
Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job.
Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems.
Got a job first thing in the morning, first day of season. Saturday I'll hunt for myself. Twombley something. - Er --
Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official from Massachusetts. You're lucky.
Don't know about lucky. The guy's a full-blown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there.
How'd you get the job?
Like you and Gordon?
Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
Bastard's got his high beams on.
Aw, shit, she's here to get Jill. Me and Jill had a little argument. Jack, I got to get back, get back to town. Move this thing, will you? See if you can get back to the Town Hall before they get there, okay?
Where'd Twombley get shot?
In the chest.
No, I mean whereabouts.
A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
You stayed away?
Yeah.
Where'd you get the blood?
What blood?
On your sleeve.
Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?
I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean?
Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.
I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
Sure you did.
What?
Saw him do it?
What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.
You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.
There's your old twenty-gauge, and that there's the new Browning you was showing me last night. This must be Twombley's gun. Brand new. Very fancy tooling. Probably fired one time. It's a beautiful piece of work. But what the hell, Jack, I guess you deserve it. Right's right.
Yeah.
Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.
I'm fucking out of here.
Lawford?
Open the door, will ya?
Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
Open the door. We're late.
I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow.
I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now. I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were hungry, remember.
Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
Yeah.
Those are the Hoyts.
I don't care. They're out.
Why do they do that?
Do what?
You know.
Break stuff?
Yeah. It's stupid.
I guess they're stupid.
Did you do that when you were a kid?
Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that.
Was it funny?
To us it was.
But it's not funny now.
It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change.
I bet you did lots of bad things.
What are you talking about?
I just think you used to be bad.
No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?
Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know.
I don't want to.
Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
It's not that.
What then?
It's stupid.
It's fun.
I want to go home. I don't like it here.
Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.
No.
No what?
No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.
I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.
Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.
I called Mommy.
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
Yes.
Jesus, why?
I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
See, I knew you'd be mad.
Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
She's gone already! Gone already! Couldn't wait.
Yes.
That's all you got to say? "Yes".
Yes.
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
Yes.
Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait for her by yourself. That's fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going downstairs.
Dad.
Are we going in this?
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
It's pretty old.
It belongs to Pop.
Pop?
Grandpa. My father. It's his.
How about a Big Mac?
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?
No.
What do you want, then?
Nothing.
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.
Nothing, I guess. I guess I can wait till we get home. Maybe we'll stop by Wickham's for a hamburger when we get to Lawford. That suit you? You always like Wickham's.
Okay.
Please don't cry. Please, honey.
What are you sorry for?
I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to.
I want to go home.
That's illegal, you know.
I know.
You're a policeman.
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing happened.
I want to go home.
We're looking for the funniest costume! And the scariest! And the most imaginative! And the best costume of all!
Tomorrow, Gordon.
Told you the snow was coming down. Take the grader.
Where's the plow?
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
His son-in-law damn near killed me.
Huh?
At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.
Don't go playing policeman.
What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.
You don't want the extra police pay?
I'm not saying that.
Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left.
Fuck you.
What's the hurry?
A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
Huh?
I figured you already heard.
Fuck. Turn it off. All you heard was there was some kinda accident?
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
You mean Twombley?
He more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something. That's what usually happens.
I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.
I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.
You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.
That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.
You want me to follow them to Littleton?
What the fuck. My day's already ruined. Give me the keys. You can go back with Jack. You still got a shitload of plowing to do.
It ain't done, if that's what you mean.
Something bugging you?
Yeah. A few things.
How you holding up, Wade?
I'm fine, fine.
Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
On what you pay me?
What do I have to do for it?
Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.
I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
So?
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
You? Why?
Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.
What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?
Want to buy?
Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
I won't. You interested?
Maybe.
You and Mel Gordon?
Could be.
Wade, you're done. Let me have the shop keys.
You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves. Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
The key, Wade.
Lillian!
Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --
While you went off for a few beers with your friends? Is that Hettie Rodgers there, with whatzizname?
Yeah.
She's grown up some, hasn't she?
I don't want her to go, Lillian.
Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
You ever come to your father's grave anymore?
No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
We should talk.
We've done all our talking, Wade.
It's just...
Wait there. She'll be right out. Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford?
Yeah, lots.
See. Get your boots.
No problem. Look, I...
You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.
Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?
Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
Did you get his number?
I know who it is.
Good. Who?
Mel Gordon.
I still don't understand --
New hat? Jill's up, I see.
For a while.
How's she doing?
Okay. She's fine.
Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.
See you tomorrow, maybe.
You okay?
You okay?
Yeah.
I'm sorry about what I said.
Said what?
About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?
Forget it.
I'm sorry.
You don't mean that.
Yeah. I mean that.
No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
Call me.
Tonight. Let's get together.
Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks.
There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.
I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
Money.
Jack doesn't need money.
Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
I can see what you looked like as a kid.
You knew me as a kid.
Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
What way?
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now?
I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.
Then... I guess you have to.
There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me.
Oh, Wade.
I've been thinking about it, that's all.
You've been married twice --
It was to the same woman. I was just a kid... It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?
Alright. I'll think about it.
Did you tell them? That we were coming?
Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
I know your parents.
Are you sure they're home? Did you call?
Strange.
Think they're alright?
Of course! I would've heard.
How?
This is nuts.
What happened?
What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
Going somewhere, Margie?
I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.
Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.
There's a furnace.
You're not using it today?
It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
Coffee's perked.
When did she die?
It makes me sad.
Can --?
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'
Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
What the hell are you talking about?
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?
Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--
Hold on!
Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
Yes. Here's your ticket.
Who are you?
I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
He's asleep. We were up very late.
Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
Something about my father?
Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
Take care, Wade.
It don't look right.
What?
The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.
I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.
This town sucks.
Marg!
That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different.
You talked to Jack?
Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
Jack?
The other guy.
Where... how'd you hear that?
CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?
Wade, I got a message for you. Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you. Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall.
His office. You mean my old office.
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
He got his deer yet?
Rolfe.
Just do it.
What was that? You got something to say, say it! Say it!
Nothing.
Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?
Sleeping.
You remember Margie Fogg?
From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
Where's Ma?
Yeah.
I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.
Is there something wrong with the phone?
In the living room.
Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.
Pop, for Christ's sake!
You! By Christ, you -- I know you. Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I know you. You're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart!
You don't know me. You don't know me! So fuck you. Fuck you.
Love! What the fuck do you know about love?
Love! I'm made of love!
Call it what you want.
Everything you know is from me.
Yeah.
Bang!
Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town!
Crawl!
Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!
Rolfe.
Wade?
Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?
There was something. It happened up your way.
Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.
Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it.
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
Who?
Twombley.
No shit.
You think Jack shot him?
Well, it was an accident.
Lillian was here. In Lawford.
Huh?
The night before the shooting.
How was she?
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
Who?
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
What happened?
Don't think about it. You're exhausted.
Yeah, I guess.
Get some sleep.
I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.
Haven't you already done a bit of that?
Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do, I guess.
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
No thanks. I don't drink.
What about Margie?
What about her?
Well, do you still plan to get married?
I want to let the gas run out. I don't want the bastard driving drunk, and he's always drunk now. After, we'll hide the keys.
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
Find them everywhere.
I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
Which is?
That it wasn't an accident.
Then who shot him?
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
Motive. You gotta have a motive.
Money.
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
I don't know. You tell me.
Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
A hunting accident is perfect.
It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?
Not particularly.
Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after.
Yeah.
I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
Well, I never heard that one.
I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.
Then you accidentally see your body, or your face, or whatever, and you don't know who the hell it belongs to. Strange. It's the business with the old man, I know, and how incredibly pissed I was at him, and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that, and the Goddamned truck going through the ice, not to mention Margie's being so upset -- one thing
Wade, are you alright?
I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it.
To help, Jack, of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons. That's what Alma calls them. Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?
It's not like he hasn't made us wait a few times.
Well, you aren't the President, dear.
You don't want to say hi to your father?
I'm sure he's busy.
Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream.
Alice...
Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
You're jet-lagged. We'll talk about this back...
We'll talk at home. You know, most girls aren't as lucky as you. For most girls seeing the Bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime.
He's in a meeting. He can't be disturbed.
I'm sorry, honey.
When I write my memoirs I think I'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One.
Your father never means to be so...
I know... But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world. Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh. I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
Some kids were teasing you?
You're right and I'll tell you a secret. I know exactly how you feel.
Mom?
Yes dear?
Daddy. Daddy, please...
I don't drink coffee.
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
You're one of Stravanavitch's men.
So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.
Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
The woman you shot. She was my friend.
Fuck off, you stupid asshole.
He didn't leave us.
Oooooh, I'm good.
How was... ...the ballet?
It was the experience of a lifetime.
Alice!
Daddy...
How you doing, sweetie?
Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...
There they are!
The Americans say they are escorting a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747.
Did we warn them off?
It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.
They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet.
Do you see the maintenance panel?
Got it.
Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
It's cut.
U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One.
Mr. President, it's an honor. Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here.
You read my mind.
Put your pilot on.
Who's flying the fucking plane?
Two and three are heading toward the Boeing.
Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
Got it.
How we doing, Colonel?
Uh, we got a problem here.
Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
Aw, man. You're torn up pretty bad out here, sir. Do you have any elevater control.
Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
He's dead then. They must have killed him.
We don't know that.
Walter, if you have a point, make it.
They aren't answering their hails.
They've got no chutes. They can't control the plane, their engines are failing and they're losing fuel.
I prefered the terrorists.
Sir, you threw out page two.
Goddamn right I did. I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit. What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?
It was a good ad-lib, sir.
Apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders isn't as popular as we thought it'd be. Representative Taylor is working on a compromise.
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.
General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.
Can we do that?
But they start executing hostages in
I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.
They still have the President, it's past their deadline and they haven't called. What do you think it means?
If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission.
Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?
Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this?
Yes, Mr. President.
Why?
Because it is my duty.
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
Air Force One, this is AF-135-RA. We have been instructed to refuel your plane.
About goddamn time.
Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over.
Air Force One, please reduce speed to 250 knots.
That's affirmative.
We've already been inspected.
The rest of the secret service?
Dead.
How many others killed?
Nine.
Who did this?
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.
why did they do that?
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
How?
Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.
We've stopped dumping... but we've only got about twenty minutes of fuel left.
We're not going to make it.
Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
Where are we now?
Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.
Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.
Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.
Stand by.
We copy. Stand by... Tower?
Tower, here.
This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs. Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One. This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.
Ms. Mitchell. So nice to finally meet you in person.
Up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the Mission Communication Center. The MCC, as we call it, can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth. We're linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations. We could run the country or run a war from there if we had to.
This is a remarkable aircraft.
You don't know the half of it. Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation? We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
A dubious distinction, no?
And all these rooms here?
Here's a press kit. I'll let you guys get comfortable and once we're airborne I'll be able to schedule the interviews.
* Please tell me your name.
Maria... Maria Mitchell.
I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
You're pointing a gun at me.
Fear will keep you alive. Any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish, and bound to die.
What do you want with us?
Now, or he dies, please.
Leave my daughter alone.
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall? But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
What do you know of my husband?
I know he left you behind.
My husband is a very courageous man.
Do you have to be so brutal?
Yes
Why? Do you enjoy it?
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
But they are not ny people. You look at me as if I am a monster, but answer me this -- when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces You will never see? Did You cry for their wives and children. They were people too, yes...
That was war.
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.
No.
Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.
The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.
Four...
Jim...
You got what you wanted. You going to release us now?
Now since we've had very little luck getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate, I wondered if you would be so kind.
Over my dead body.
She isn't a part of this. This is between you and me.
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
Stop.
You'll do it?
Yes, I'll do it. Just leave my family alone.
Someday, you'll regret my nature.
The taste of defeat is bitter, no?
There goes your ride.
Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.
Our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground. Our hands are completely tied while they're in the air.
Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
Twenty minutes?
Madame Vice president. We have an options paper. chandler takes the options paper, waves off Lee, and reads it as she talks.
Finally, we can bargain.
Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100 hours. What you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades.
The northern border's gotten a bit hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag with our Tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage.
Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there?
We've already played our cards, Major. There's no turning back.
We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...
Get `em ready. You... come with me.
Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
I'll not going without my family.
Sir, we stay with the President.
May I speak to you for a moment?
Can't it wait?
Don't. I know spin control when I feel it.
For godsakes, Jim, slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy. Not even you can plug all the world's leaks. Don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on MTV news than in person.
She's a big girl. She understands.
How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.
You know what?
What?
I miss you. And I miss her.
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.
How did your speech go?
Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer.
I don't know why you stayed.
Call Petrov... I'll be back.
What are you doing?
Flying the plane.
The fax machines.
Excuse me?
The fax machines.
No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
Where are we sending it?
Someone should give you a raise.
Did they say anything about my family?
They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
and if that means negotiating...
You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.
Please, Mr. President. You're going to get yourself killed. Is that your solution?
What's going on?
We're under attack.
Where's my family?
One.
But...
White House switchboard. How may I direct your call.
Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?
who can I say is calling?
This is the President.
Yeah, right.
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
Okay... if you're the President, when's your wife's birthday?
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
Thank you for calling the white House...
* CBS said they'll give us four minutes. They thought the Russian was a nice touch.
You wanna knock of f?
No, no. I'm fine. What did the Speaker say?
With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one. Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch.
I might still have a few chips left.
* We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge. The second amendment types'll love that.
This is a crime bill, Shep. Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee. Besides, Shep, I told you... I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.
Other way around, sir.
It's bait. Don't take it.
Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television. You can't afford to leave that hanging.
I said it's not worth the fight. Steward, please.
You give me ulcers.
Defense and State Department in the conference room in one hour. I want to review the Iraq situation.
Mr. President... they're ready for you in the conference room.
Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?
Shepherd.
My god. I think that was a MiG.
Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.
Shit.
How long's it been since you flew, sir?
Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment.
IT'S OPEN!
WE'RE HOOKED!
Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing.
And what do the boys on the board know about safety, Commissioner? Let <u>me</u> talk to them.
You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board.
What?
That's right, Commissioner. Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.
That just doesn't make any sense.
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
Forget it. I was reading.
I was reading too.
What's the story?
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
Kruger, Sagittarius.
Did you feel that?
Yes I did...
Felt like a large asteroid.
Yes it did. Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?
What is it, Mary?
Oveur.
Shut down accelerators.
We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir.
Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four.
Dunn.
Sir?
Elaine.
Te...!
It's got to be stopped!
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
Ted, what's wrong?
Ted, you're overworked. You've been flying yourself into the ground.
There's nothing wrong with me!
Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
Elaine.
Elaine, what happened to us?
Eat this spaghetti, Ted. It'll make you feel a lot better.
Who's that, Ted?
Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way.
His name's David Stockman. He's been here twenty years, that's all he says.
No goodbyes, Elaine. Just go.
If that's the way you want it.
That's the way I want it. Just turn the radio on and go.
Ted! What are you...?
Ted, we're taking off!
What are you doing, Ted?
Ted.
Not now, Elaine!
Elaine.
Ted. I don't know why you got on this flight. I don't know what you're trying to prove.
Elaine, we have to go back.
We can't go back. We had something very special, but it's all over.
Ted, get a grip on yourself. You should never have left the hospital.
Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
What word would you use, Elaine?
The word is sick. Ted -- very, very, very sick.
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
I'd use the word insane.
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine. I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
Elaine!
Ted!
Elaine, what's going on?
Elaine, I'm going back there. Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.
Not now, Elaine.
Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place. You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly. You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program.
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
Simon just ejected!
Sit down, Elaine. If this bomb trick works we just might make it. Simon was a fool to eject now.
You mean...
That's right -- premature ejection.
What will happen to him, Ted?
Are you afraid?
Not when I'm with you, Ted.
We've blown the computer! Elaine! Set course change!
Set!
Now!
Ted, the lever!
Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.
So you see, our task isn't made any easier by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick.
You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol.
I mean for Ted.
You can be gentle with him, Elaine. He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.
The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.
Is he making any progress, Doctor?
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.
Simon.
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
Women <u>and</u> the space program have come a long way, sweetheart. But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl.
But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.
Frank's the best pilot in the program.
I'm so excited, Simon.
I guess this is a first for you.
Elaine! Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.
Simon, why has he become so... so...
Meet me onboard, sweetheart. I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.
Have you got it straightened out now?
I think so.
Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.
Simon, what's happening?!
He tried to disconnect ROK. It gassed him. That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.
Can't we change course?
My career is shot.
Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends! You'll die out there.
Maybe.
Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan. Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications.
I don't think we have any alternative, Captain.
I see. What do you think our alternatives are?
Roger.
You can do it from up here, Captain.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
Intermitant failure in scan mode "R". Analyze.
Negative.
That doesn't make sense. Repeat analysis.
Negative.
That's not possible.
Elaine, I'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago.
That's okay, ROK.
Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
Go ahead.
Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.
Systems check positive. Look, Elaine, I...
Request; life support systems check.
Life support check. Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me. You're a woman. I can relate to that.
Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.
Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?
I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us.
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
How many kids get a chance to live on another planet.
No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?
Come on up, Jimmy. Say, that's some puppy. What's his name?
Scraps.
Can I hold him?
Sure.
He's a boy dog.
Yeah.
Take this, Joey. It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there.
We've spent everything on these operations. Is it really worth it? We've pawned your mother's wedding ring. The kids have no winter clothes...
Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.
I don't want to hear that word!
Okay, Joey. The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country.
All right. Here.
Joe, you don't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people.
I don't want to live anymore.
Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids. You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.
What?
That's right, Joe. Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.
You're sure?
A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary. Over.
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
No. Poached. Over.
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur? Over.
That's how I want them. Poached. Over.
All right, Captain Oveur. Over.
Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it.
Which passenger is Joe Salucci?
Sixteen 'C', why?
He's carrying a bomb.
No, a bomb. Now, as discreetly as possible, I want you to move the passengers into the lounge.
What should I say?
Captain Oveur?
Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
That's how dry cleaning works. Now I'd like to quickly go over the digestive system of amphibians.
Good to be aboard, gentlemen.
Whenever your're ready, Captain.
You folks need any help?
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
Yes.
It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
Let's go, Daddy. We have to check in. He was never appreciated at the Institute.
Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.
I have to see Bud Kruger.
Do you have an appointment, sir?
No, dammit. It's a matter of life or death.
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
All right, it's a matter of death.
You can't go in there!
Don't try to stop me!
Are you on the Mercury mission?
You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker.
Look at this wiring. It's shorting out under high temperatures.
You're tired, Striker, overworked. That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
Striker.
Kurtz, you're drunk. Who's in command of this ship?
That damn computer has taken over. I'm getting out.
Then Elaine was right.
Don't talk to me about Elaine. Outta my way!
Excuse me, are you alright? I noticed you talking to yourself. I'm a nurse. Can I be of some help?
Uh... oh, thank you. It's nothing.
You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
Yes. He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.
I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
You've been hurt.
I'm getting over it. If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.
Do you want to talk about it.
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
No. I mean your relationship.
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
Love's the same as it always was. It's people who change.
People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
Sure. But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
No. It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father's dying.
I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee.
Ah, won't you sit down?
Thank you. Cream?
No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.
Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?
After my wife died, I felt like a fifth wheel. You know, so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was lost. I couldn't function socially and I couldn't function in business.
Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.
But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?
Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.
I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.
I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.
You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.
Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?
No. I'm all alone.
Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years.
Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.
Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.
Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much.
...but after...awhile...you begin to... ...get used to it.
Both pilots!
Can you fly this airplane and land it?
Surely you can't be serious.
I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?
Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently, so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.
...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.
Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?
Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
Surely there must be something you can do.
George Zipp said that?
And the last thing he said to me, "Doc," he said, "Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc," he said, "but I won't smell too good. That's for sure."
Captain, how soon can we land?
Can't you take a guess?
Well...not for another two hours.
You can't take a guess for another two hours?
What is it, Doctor? What's happening?
Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?
That's right.
We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?
You'd better tell the Captain. We've got to land as soon as we can. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital.
A hospital? What is it?
It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.
What was it we had for dinner tonight?
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
What did he have?
Doctor Rumack, Mister Hammen ate fish. And Randy says there are five more cases, and they ate fish, too.
Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?
Just how serious is it, doctor?
Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?
No.
All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?
No. No one that I know of.
Elaine!
Ted!
I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
I just don't want to go over it any more.
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over.
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.
Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.
But if you'll just give me...
Ted, what are you doing here?
Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
What's the matter?
My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.
Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
I love you, Elaine.
Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember?
Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us.
That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.
You got a telegram from head­quarters today.
Headquarters!? What is it?
Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid.
I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.
What's his problem?
I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball!
Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!
Rain.
And a little ice.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.
Rats! I've lost number three.
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
But Ted, you're the only...
Ted...
Yes?
I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
See them, Elaine?
We have a visitor.
We'd better get back now.
Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight.
Airsick?
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.
You promise you'll write.
Good-bye, darling.
Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.
So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.
Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.
Good-bye, darling.
Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.
And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?
Yes, Captain?
Did you decide on a runway yet?
Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero eight niner.
He's all over the place! Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet! What an asshole!
He's right on the heading.
Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago.
What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'
Oh, I can't stand it.
How ya doing, honey?
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
Wait a minute. I know you. You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar. You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers!
You <u>are</u> Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets!
I'm an airline pilot. Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies.
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
Hi!
I'm Randy.
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!
I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
Oh, I'd love to.
Would either of you like another cup of coffee?
Yes?
Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?
Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?
Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?
Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.
Roger.
Roger.
We have clearance, Clarence.
Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?
No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.
Excuse me, Sister?
Yes?
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...
Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.
Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.
Fourteen-B. It's halfway down on your right.
Do you feel all right, sir?
Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?
Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering...
The cockpit? What is it?
Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.
Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.
Oooh. Hardball. That sounds interesting. Are you going to strike me? You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me... I've got my own ropes.
Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
Look, I don't know where Mr. Strader might be. He comes and he goes.
The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson. Maybe he knows.
I know... Why don't you hang around for a while, let me entertain you? It's Matt, right? Now tell me the truth, have you ever... made it... with one of us?
Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.
There's lots of things I haven't done, but his ain't high on the list. Don't take it personally.
I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out. A little scared... and a lot curious. Maybe more than you want to admit. But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together? Think of it as broadening your horizons.
I like my horizons narrow.
You okay?
You are Cassandra?
That's right.
We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--
He's not here. Why ask me?
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
In there.
So what've you got on Tuggle's killers?
Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours. Me and Alterez are on it, okay?
You don't have squat.
Look at your dildo partner. He's too scared to even come down to the sand. You're not gonna get wet standing here, moron!
Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson. Forget you hip waders, big guy?
Lay off, asshole.
William Harcourt?
Yes...
I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.
Yes, I heard about poor Warren. Tragic.
You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...
That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver.
This is becoming a serious breach of security.
He didn't recognize me.
When we picked him up, he was talking to those two cops -- the two who came to question you about Hubley.
Kill them both.
Here?
... and we work my hours. I'll do the driving, you do the paperwork. You gotta learn it so you might as well do it all.
Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
What's that? Look, Jetson. Get this straight in your head. We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners. And don't call me Sergeant. Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.
Man, somebody really hung one on you! I've heard some good ones for you guys... Humphrey Bogart, Harley Davidson. I guess the people at immigration got a little punchy after a while, coming up with names for a quarter of a million of you. You weren't at the back of the line, were you, George?
My true name is Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'.
Anyway, what's it matter to you if we think it's funny, right? Whatta you care?
Let's talk Hubley.
His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
Through the chest. Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.
Terrific. A real pillar of the community. Was Hubley missing anything when they found him? Was he ripped off?
There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.
The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for. I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...
Look, you want to fit in here, right? You want to learn how to get along?
Yes.
What is wrong?
Well... yes, quite possibly.
Possibly. Good. Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other? Does that sound unreasonable to you?
Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--
What's this? What's going on?
Nothing.
Nothing?
What is this?
Get the picture?
And that fits?
Well... Yeah, it's rubber. It stretches.
Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks.
How the hell do you know that?
A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.
So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery. I'd say that "possible" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible. Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night.
I believe I should interview the widow alone.
Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well.
Did you learn anything?
A week ago two men came to see her husband. After they left, he was very frightened. She identified one of the men from a photo I showed her. It was Hubley.
Aw-right. What about the other guy?
She didn't know him. But she said her son might.
Did you talk to him?
Rudyard Kipling? No shit? Listen, we just need a minute of your time...
Why did you do it?
Why'd I do what?
Agree to work with me? You don't like me... you don't like any of us. You have nothing but contempt for us. And yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner...
Who said that?
Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter, would it?
Uh, Matthew...
Back off, George.
But I-- .
Screw you.
Tell me.
Your mother mates out of season.
Matthew, you don't have to-- .
You know that guy?
From quarantine, when my people first arrived here. He and I were housed together.
How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
If I may make a suggestion... We have different weak spots than you do. Next time, a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm, here, will produce the effect I think you were looking for.
I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit. How long did it take you to learn English?
Which one is that? Raw what?
This is mole. It's good.
I'll bet. Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?
So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?
Ss'loka'. It means literally "small but intelligent creature". It loses much in the translation.
And what was that one about my mother? That was a good one.
Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.
Who is he?
We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch.
I believe he is probably lying.
So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she?
Yeah... I know the routine.
You are married?
Was. Divorced.
We mate for life. Divorce... is a strange concept to us.
Your home is quite disordered. I thought perhaps you had been burglarized when I walked in.
Human children can be very beautiful. Getting married? Congratulations. You will be taking Sunday off, then...
... and so, and so the doctor says, "If this is the thermometer, then where'd I leave the pen?" You're not... you don't think that's funny? George, work with me, I always get a laugh with that one. Look, if the doctor's got the thermometer in his hand, then where's his pen gotta be?
In the other man's rectum.
Your health...
There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other.
No shit, Holmes. You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
I hope you can understand how special your world is... how unique a people you humans are. So it us all the more painful and confusing to us that so few of you seem capable of living up the the ideals you set for yourselves.
I'm going home.
Where'd you get this?!!
She's going to divorce me.
George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
Well, let's roll, George.
To the... to the beach?
Stop the car.
Why?
Please, I must get out here.
Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
It's all right, George. It's cool. Just wait here, all right? I'll be back in a coupla minutes.
What was that about?
... So we've got three guys dead. All Newcomers, all killed the same way -- execution style.
Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...
What's this nothing shit? It wasn't nothing yesterday when you asked Bentner to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits, and it's not nothing now. Don't lie to me, George, you're bad at it.
No secrets, goddammit! You don't hold back from me. Whatever is going on, you're gonna tell me now!
No. I cannot involve you. This is not your concern.
The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist! That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either? Am I right? TELL ME! What is it?
... It is called ss'jabroka'. To us it is a potent narcotic.
How potent?
Like your cocaine, I suppose. The "high" lasts several hours. We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
We? You've taken it?
We all did.
Where did he get it? Was there any of it on the ship?
No... I am sure not. That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here. But none of my people know how to make it. The process was carefully guarded.
Jesus, this is major. Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
George... look me in the eye... George, you don't ever lie to me again.
They had months in quarantine to develop the plan. Porter, with his chemistry background, must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug. Hubley manufactured it -- at the refinery. Strader, through the nightclub, established a distribution network. And Harcourt--
Okay, George -- we gotta play this real smart.
If the drug is here, we must destroy it.
Uh, George...
George, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones...
George, c'mon -- lighten up. It's a beauty of a case. Don't sweat it -- we got him by the short hairs. He ain't gonna make any more of the shit.
The fifty kilos, Matthew. I have to find it. I can't let it get out on the street.

Shit!
With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I assume you will be requesting reassignment now.
What's this about, George? I know that look.
No! We must do this alone.
What is this?!
... It's Harcourt.
Harcourt is dead.
No he's not. Not if he overdosed on the drug. Massive amounts trigger a... a change. Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation. When you emerge you're...
I never thought I'd say this, but -- for once in my life I think I'm willing to wait for back-up.
We can't let him get away.
Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.
But there's no more drug.
How do I look?
You said you wanted the biggest thing I could find... Well, this is it.
What is it?
Casull .454 Magnum. You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.
Only holds five.
Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder. Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.
Mr. Hubley was an all right guy -- and a damn good manager. The men liked him. I'm really gonna have to scramble to fill his shoes.
You think this is the guy who did it?
We think he could'a been involved, yeah. You know him?
To be honest, it's hard to say. I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
Who else can I ask around here?
Wait. You know who it looks like? Yeah. Anderson. Uh... James Anderson. He isn't in today. He took the afternoon off.
That where Anderson worked?
Don't piss him off, O'Neal. When he gets like this, I can't control him. I've seen this before. He got like this once -- I saw him jerk a guy's spine out and show it to him. Nothing I could do. I hadda go throw up.
Here's Hubley. Left Quarantine on November thirtieth, relocated first to Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year. Field of expertise: chemical manufacturing. Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery.
Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
Released December one. He and his wife moved first to Modesto, then Coalinga, California -- wherever that is -- settled in L.A. in April. Field of expertise: organic chemical engineering. He and his wife have one child, a son.
Yeah -- we met him. Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?
Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already? Let's try again-- Is your name Porter?
Ss'kya'ta'.
One of the two men was Hubley, right? What about the other one? Did you know him?
Yeah... I seen him around. High- roller dude named Strader. Joshua Strader. Runs a club on the west side. Encounters.
Yeah, I heard of it.
You know I've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning...
Yeah, right. Don't push your luck. Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car--
The human?
No I.D. on him and -- well, you know, no fingerprints -- so it could be tough. Your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match.
You took this gut out, too, didn't you?
Yeah.
Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.
Lucky nothing. I had to empty my damn gun into him.
Oh, here's an extra headshot if you need one. We're just about to start cutting in. You're welcome to stick around if you want. It's really fascinating stuff.
You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?
What kind of test?
Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.
Yeah, Sykes?
You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle's death. You know that. Leave that for Fedorchuk.
Departmental policy.
Granger and Pitts are already on it.
Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...
Hope their plumbing's the same.
How can I go?
Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church. Simple. Me and Carol are going.
What?
Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember? You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...
Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see Kristin get married, okay? But--
But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.
Does that look at all suspicious to you?
You got your vest?
Of course. Right in the trunk of the car.
Watch the driver. I'm going for a better angle on the door.
Get outta there!
I can't! Do you mind!
This floor's freezing.
Christ. I never saw such a buncha old women. You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?
Whoooah! No shit? I'm impressed.
Hey, 'Top.' What's the op?
Movement!
Position?
Can't lock up...
Talk to me, Hudson.
...that's better. Pan it around a bit.
Okay, let's do it.
Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast. Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station.
First squad up, on line. Hicks, get yours in a cordon. Watch the rear.
Flame-units only. I want rifles slung.
Uh,...Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC, over.
I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis. It seems to be metabolizing. He should wake up soon.
Which would mean lots of those parasites, right? One for each person...over a hundred at least.
Yes. That follows.
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
That is the question of the hour. We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others. A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all. It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors. She is the center of their lives, quite literally the mother of their society.
Could it be intelligent?
That's it. See it? Emergency venting.
How long until it blows?
And it's too late to shut it down?
I'll go.
What?
I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to. I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.
It's going to be closer. You better get going.
HOW MUCH TIME?
PLENTY! TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
Ripley...
She's alive. They brought her here and you know it.
You did okay, Bishop.
Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...
Have they located my daughter yet?
Is she...?
Amy.
You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.
Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there. You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
I get the picture.
You had them eating out of your hand, kiddo.
They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.
No. There's no way!
Hear me out...
What about you? What's your interest in this?
Yeah, yeah. I saw the commercial.
I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
That's right.
Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
It's all I could get. Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything. Days off are worse.
What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
If I go.
If you go. It's a second chance, kiddo. And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it. You gotta get back on the horse...
Yes, and I've read it. You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...
Yello? Oh, Ripley. Hi...
Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them. Not study. Not bring back. Just burn them out...clean ...forever.
You never said anything about an android being here! Why not?
I hope you're right. I really do.
That the atmosphere processor?
They're right under the primary heat exchangers.
Yeah? Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
That's not what I mean. Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
No good. How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry? I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit. It's the only way to be sure.
Now hold on a second. I'm not authorizing that action.
Well, I mean...I know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments. Let's move cautiously. First, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it --
They can bill me. I got a tab running. What's second?
This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --
You son of a bitch.
Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
What rank? I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
Corporal Hicks!?
Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division. Now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes. Set up for life.
You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.
You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.
But they will know about it, Burke. From me. Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
Now, wait a second --
You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?
I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.
Look, we don't know what's going on out there. It may just be a down transmitter. But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor. That's all.
You wouldn't be going in with the troops. I can guarantee your safety.
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
Still nothing from the colony?
Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony.
What's he scanning for?
We're talking thermonuclear explosion.
How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant?
Hold at forty. Slow circle of the complex.
One of us?
Where are your parents? You have to try...
What is it?
I don't know.
So.
So...then the fusion containment shuts down.
GET THEM OUT OF THERE! DO IT NOW!
I told them to fall back...
How do you feel?
All right, I guess. One hell of a hangover. Look, Ripley... I...
At ease. I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but...
Sir?
Yes, Hicks?
Hudson, Sir. He's Hicks.
What's the question?
Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
Are there any questions? Hudson?
All right, the area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us. First team head for operations. Hudson, see if you can get their CPU on line. Hicks, meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower...
...We're coming in.
Sir, the CPU is on-line.
Hah! Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen! Found 'em.
Alive?
We're not making that out too well. What is it?
Save it.
Let's get the fuck out of here!
Well that's great! That's just fucking great, man. Now what the fuck are we supposed to do, man? We're in some real pretty shit now!
Outstanding. Then all we need's a deck of cards. All right, let's move like we got a purpose.
We got problems.
Maybe we got 'em demoralized.
The corner! Ready?
Seventeen meters.
Well you're not reading it right!
Let's go! Let's go!
Removed surgically before embryo implantation. Subject: Marachuk, John L. Died during procedure. They killed him getting it off.
How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue?
All right. There's a fire door at this end. The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door.
We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
They're in the approach corridor.
Now many?
Newt time then can walk right up and knock.
They'll get us.
Maybe. Maybe not.
Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others. You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?
What's this?
Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
Look, you started this. Now show me everything. I can handle myself.
Wait a minute. We'd know about it.
You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse. You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.
It's game time.
They learned. They cut the power and avoided the guns. They must have found another way in, something we missed.
Locked.
No! No! She's alive! We have to --
Hicks, don't let him leave.
Ellen.
Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?
Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.
Fuck you.
All right, we can't blow the fuck out of them...why not roll some canisters of CN-20 down there. Nerve gas the whole nest?
Yeah, bullshit. Watch us.
Oh, man. And I was gettin' short, too! Four more weeks and out. Now I'm gonna buy it on this fuckin' rock. It ain't half fair, man!
It's inside the complex.
You're just reading me.
Sounds like you, Hicks.
Looks like it stung him.
You can't help them. Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.
Man, we're not going to make it seventeen hours! Those things are going to come in here, just like they did before, man... they're going to come in here and get us, man, long before...
This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth.
Thanks.
We need the other drop-ship. The on one the Sulaco. We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.
How? The transmitter was on the APC. It's wasted.
I don't care how! Think of a way. Think of something.
Think of what? We're fucked.
Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there. Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.
They cut the power.
This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place...
Range twenty meters.
Fifteen meters.
Twelve meters. Man, this is a big fucking signal. Ten meters.
Nine meters. Eight.
Can't be. That's inside the room!
You remember you sent some wildcatters out to that plateau, out past the Ilium range, a couple days ago?
Yeah. What?
There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team. Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.
Christ. Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look. They don't say why, and I don't ask. I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.'
So what do I tell this guy?
And how are we today?
Terrible.
Just terrible? That's better than yesterday at least.
How long have I been on Gateway station?
Bad dreams again? Do you want something to help you sleep?
What did you say?
Casey. She's my only friend.
I don't want you for a friend.
Why not?
They'd be here if they could, honey. I know they would.
They're dead.
Newt. Look at me...Newt. I won't leave you. I promise.
You promise?
Cross my heart.
I was the best at the game. I knew the whole maze.
The 'maze'? You mean the air ducts?
Yeah, you know. In the walls, under the floor. I was the ace. I could hide better than anybody.
I guess we're not leaving, right?
I'm sorry, Newt.
Now you just lie here and have a nap. You're exhausted.
Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.
Oh. Sorry, Newt.
Yes, there are, aren't there.
Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.
I don't know, Newt. That's the truth.
Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
No, it's different, honey.
Did you ever have a baby?
Yes. A little girl.
Where is she?
Gone.
Don't go! Please.
Newt. Newt, wake up.
Wah...? Where are...?
Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm scared.
Burke! Open the door!
Come on. Crawl faster.
DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?
This way. Come on, we're almost there!
I knew you'd come.
Mommy...Mommy?
Are we going to sleep now?
That's right.
Can we dream?
Look, I told you...
The analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe...
Look, I can see where this is going. But I'm telling you those things exist. Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs. Thousands. Do you understand? I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data. Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise...
Thank you, Officer Ripley. That will be...
Why won't you check out LV-426?
Because I don't have to. The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship. And by the way, they call it Acheron now.
How many colonists?
Sixty, maybe seventy families.
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish. Be my most tasty little dish! Be my most tasty little dish!
Then that would be eating and drinking I'd live like a Prince without thinking. The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine! Then that would be eating and drinking! The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine. She's much better than wine! She's much better than wine!
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
Follow me, please. The Archbishop would like a word.
Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you?
Indeed.
These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.
His Grace is very angry with you.
Maestro.
Good morning.
Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.
Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.
Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
Yes.
Is there a part for me?
No.
How do you know?
Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.
Why not?
Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
Where?
In a harem.
What's that?
A brothel.
Oh!
A Turkish brothel.
Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it.
Oh. Well perhaps you could introduce us anyway.
What does he look like?
You might be disappointed.
Why?
Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
Did you know? Had you heard?
What?
The marriage!
Well, what does it matter to you?
How was I? Tell me honestly.
You were sublime.
What did you think of the music?
Extremely clever.
Katherina! I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to write another aria for you. Something even more amazing for the second act. I have to get some water. Her mother is lying on the stage.
Don't bother!
What?
Don't bother.
Oh - excuse me!
Is her mother still lying on the floor?
No, she's fine.
Is she a good fuck?
What??
No, no, no, no. You can't take him away now. This is his night. Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?
No! I won't have him back.
But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding.
Hardly.
Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.
Sir -
Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
And how will you make him keep it?
Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.
You have leave to try.
Why what, sir?
Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?
Humiliated?
If His Grace is not satisfied with me, he can dismiss me.
I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there patiently. I will speak to you further when I come.
No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.
Don Giovannnnnnnni!
Who the devil are you? What do you want?
I've come to dinnnnnner!
Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height.
In the pot, I have got a good dinner. Not a sausage or stew, but a singer. Not a sausage or stew but a singer. Is the treat that I'll eat for my meat!
What is it?
I want to go!
Where?
I want to go back to Vienna.
Now?
Yes!
Why?
I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.
Stop it!
No! No! No!
Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?
Where?
We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.
Your Grace, I've got something to tell you. I want to complain about this man.
Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.
Why not?
Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.
That's stupid.
Why? People fart backwards.
Do you think that's funny?
Oh, ha, ha, ha.
Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!
Yes, you are. You're very sick.
No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!
Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!
Em iram! Em iram!
No, I'm not playing this game.
No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
No!
Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram! Em iram!
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.
Ui-vol-i-tub!
Tish-I'm tee. What's that?
What?
Tish-I'm-tee.
Eat
Yes.
Excuse me, Wolfi. Mama is not feeling very well. Can we leave now?
I think you're mad! You're really mad!
Oh, leave me alone.
One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!
They'll come anyway. They love me here.
No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.
Oh yes? You always know everything.
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
You borrowed money from your mother?
Yes!
Well, don't do that again!
How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?
Don't be stupid.
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
Stop it now. Stop it. I've brought some friends to meet you. They're next door waiting. Do we have anything to eat? They're all starving.
Tell them to go away. I don't want to see anybody.
What's the matter with you?
Tell them to go!
Sssh. What is it? Tell me.
No!
Yes!
My Stanzi - look at her! Isn't she beautiful? Come on now, confess, Papa. Could you want a prettier girl for a daughter?
Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?
Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you?
Wolfi!
What? How can you be so boring? Tea!
There's a young girl to see you.
What does she want?
I don't know.
Well, ask her!
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can -
Stanzi!
We'll have a little party. Come in. Come in. You know Herr Schikaneder? This is! a very nice girl.
Wolfi.
Yes, my love?
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
Salzburg. We were just talking about Salzburg. If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!
Wolfi! Your father is dead.
What?
Half the receipts! Stanzi!
You're not going to do this?
Why not? Half the house!
When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.
Oh, Stanzi.
I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.
Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.
Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
Who was that?
No one.
What's that? Oh! Who gave you this? How much is it? Wolfi, who gave you this?
I'm not telling you.
Why not?
No. Don't answer it!
This is my wife, Stanzi. I've been sick, but I'm all right now. Aren't I?
Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.
Give me one reason I can understand.
I can't write it!
Why not?
Go back to bed.
Excellency!
Frau Mozart?
That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.
How charming. But why did he not come himself?
He's terribly busy, sir.
I will look at them, of course, the moment I can. It will be an honour. Please give him my warmest.
Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
Really?
My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
Then he didn't send you?
No, sir. This is my own idea.
I see.
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
Are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? I have other things you might like.
That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
Originals?
These are originals?
It is miraculous.
Tomorrow night I dine with the Emperor. One word from me and the post is his.
Come back tonight.
Tonight?
Alone.
What for?
Some service deserves service in return. No?
What do you mean?
It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight.
But! I'm a married woman!
I do apologize for this afternoon. I behaved like a silly girl. Where shall we go?
What?
What are you doing here?
Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.
Why you?
I was at hand.
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
He needs me, ma'am.
No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.
He asked me to stay.
This is not his handwriting.
No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
I regret we have no servants to show you out, Herr Salieri. Respect my wish and go.
How much will you pay him?
Am I interrupting something?
Not at all.
Where's our friend?
He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting?
Leave him alone!
I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
He's doing his best.
I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!
You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!
Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
Money! Money!
You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.
I see that you're expecting.
Oh, yes.
When, may I ask?
What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time.
But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!
And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.
And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
Be careful!
He's adorable!
Behold!
Hey!
Behold!
Let us pass, please! Let us pass at once! We're with the Emperor.
I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.
Do you know who I am? This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!
I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.
I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass.
Upstairs.
Gertrude!
I've heard about you for ages! I thought you must be an old man.
Gertrude!
It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
I said play!
What a strange young man.
Really?
Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?
I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
Just one year.
Who was your teacher?
I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty. It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty's intention.
What a charming idea. May I see?
It's just a trifle, of course.
May I try it?
Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?
You do me too much honour, Sire.
A-flat, Majesty.
And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri.
My pleasure.
Well, I'm glad to hear that.
Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn.
Good morning, Court Composer. This is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth.
Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!
An interesting idea, Majesty. But -
Yes?
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
And the result satisfies.
Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.
I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.
You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.
Sire.
I don't think you understand me, Court Composer.
Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.
Why not?
Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.
Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.
Of course not.
I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.
Really?
As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!
Yes?
Do you like this, Salieri?
It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
Your Majesty!
Oh, thank you.
The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.
Majesty!
Why so?
Well, what is it about? Tell us the story.
Yes, where?
In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
Keep it, Sire, if you want to. It is already here in my head.
What? On one hearing only?
It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?
Yes, indeed.
And German?
Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!
So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?
Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.
What do you mean, Sire?
I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less.
My dear, young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Cut a few and it will be perfect.
Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady.
Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry?
Excuse me, but how old are you?
Twenty-six.
Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.
Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?
What is it?
May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.
Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre?
Yes, Sire.
Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?
Who told you this, Majesty?
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
Well, yes, I admit it is.
Would you tell me why?
Mozart, I am a tolerant man. I do not censor things lightly. When I do, I have good reason. Figaro is a bad play. It stirs up hatred between the classes. In France it has caused nothing but bitterness. My own dear sister Antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people. I do not wish to see the
Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.
But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love.
Ah, love again.
But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio
I have no idea.
Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you, my music is not.
You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
Ah-ha. Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?
I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.
Ah-ha. What do you say, Chamberlain?
Yes, sir.
Well, what do you have for me today?
Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
Yes, what about him?
He's here.
I write to you with urgent news. I am coming to Vienna. Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet. You are too gullible to see your own danger. As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours, do as I bid, and await my coming.
Why are you here?
Am I not welcome?
Feed? Well, of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day long. She's the best cook in the world. I mean, since Mama. Just wait, you'll see.
Is she not here?
Do you always live like this?
She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me.
Don't you have a maid?
Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.
How is your financial situation?
It couldn't be better.
That's not what I hear.
What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.
They say you're in debt.
Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
How many pupils do you have?
Pupils?
Yes.
Yes.
How many?
I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
What's that?
Oh, let's not talk about it.
Why not?
It's a secret.
You don't have secrets from me.
Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.
Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't spend any money on me.
No, really!
Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say!
I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.
Papa, is this your idea?
Are you playing a trick on me?
Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving!
Papa!
Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
No one calls you that.
Father -
Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning.
Good morning, sir.
Ah-ha! Siena macaroons - my favourites. Give my best thanks to the baker.
Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?
Yes, thank you, sir.
Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Do any pupils come to the house?
Not that I've seen.
Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?
Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.
Really? What is it he's writing?
Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
I think I've found out about the money, sir.
Where does he work?
Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
Why? What has happened?
You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
What medicine?
I don't know. He has pains.
Where?
Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
Is he working?
I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.
Is he working?
I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.
Opera? Opera!
Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
Yes?
Are you Herr Mozart?
That's right.
My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
What?
Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is?
Sssh!
Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
What did he say? What did he say?
Well?
Sublime! Utterly sublime!
Wonderful! He liked the monkey, didn't you?
Yes, well, it's all good fun.
Isn't he marvelous? He cost me a bundle, that horse, but he's worth it. I tell you, if you'd played Don Giovanni here it would have been a great success. I'm not joking. These people aren't fools. You could do something marvelous for them.
I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.
'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it,
Animals?
I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be in German.
German!
Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
Leave that alone!
Wolfi!
Put it down!
What is this?
Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?
What?
What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
Yes.
Can I see it?
No.
Why not?
Look, I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes.
Well, we can.
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Down there, damn you. Welcome to you. Pay no attention, they're impossible. Stop it, you willful things! Come this way. Just ignore them. They're perfectly harmless, just willful. I treat them just like my own children.
And which one of them do you want me to teach?
You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife.
Madame.
I'm afraid I am.
Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.
Never mind, Strudel. It's part of music, getting used to an audience. Aren't I right, Herr Mozart?
It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!
Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?
Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead?
What for?
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
I'm sorry. No.
Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
I know your work well, Signore. Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours?
Really?
Mio caro Adone.
Ah!
Love, Sire!
Yes! yes! er, on the whole, yes, Majesty.
Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.
Did you like it, then?
How could I not?
Herr Mozart, what brings you here?
Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now.
So you are. How is your pretty wife?
She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.
I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.
Why didn't you come to me yesterday, Mozart? This is a most painful situation. Yesterday I could have helped you. Today, I can't.
Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?
I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.
Filled? That's impossible! They haven't even seen my work. I need this post. Please, can't you help me? Please!
My dear Mozart, there is no one in the world I would rather help, but now it is too late.
Whom did they choose?
Herr Sommer.
Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.
No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.
But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!
Look, I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage.
You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.
It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.
How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all!
How is that possible? You give concerts, don't you? I hear they are quite successful.
They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me. They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend!
Of course not.
Do you have a daughter?
I'm afraid not.
Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll
Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.
I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret.
Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly.
Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?
Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.
Ah. Italian?
Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.
Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty?
What exactly are you working on?
I can't say. Really
Wolfgang, what is it? Sta calmo, per favore. What's the matter?
It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it.
Really? Why?
I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?
Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
You burned the score?
Oh no! My wife took it out in time.
How fortunate.
It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.
Oh, Excellency, would you?
With all my heart, Mozart.
Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn.
I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.
But what is it they don't like?
Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.
What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
I think it's marvelous. Truly.
It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?
I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend. Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap?
I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.
Oh no, the honour would be all mine.
Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!
Mozart. It was good of you to come.
How could I not?
Did my work please you?
How could it not, Excellency?
Yes?
I never knew that music like that was possible.
You flatter me.
I have come to commission work from you.
What work?
A Mass for the dead.
What dead? Who is dead?
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
Who are you?
I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well.
How long will you give me?
I don't have it yet. It's not finished. I'm sorry, but I need more time.
Are you neglecting my request?
What happened? Is it over?
I'm taking you home. You're not well.
Where is your wife?
Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa.
You mean she's not coming back?
You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.
No, please.
I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that.
This is only a vaudeville.
Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me.
Do you mean that?
I do.
I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think stupid things.
Are you ill?
The doctor thinks I am. But -
What?
Shall I answer it?
No! No, it's him!
Who?
The man. He's here.
Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it.
Finish what?
Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?
Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
Would you? Actually, you could.
My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.
But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.
Of course.
You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.
Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?
Where did I stop?
The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.
So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?
Consigned to flames of woe.
Do you believe in it?
What?
A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
Oh, yes.
Strange!
Confutatis Maledictis.
We ended in F Major?
Yes.
The Fire.
What time?
Start with the voices. Basses first. Second beat of the first measure - A. Con-fu-ta-tis. Second measure, second beat. Ma-le-dic-tis. G-sharp, of course.
Yes.
Third measure, second beat starting on E. Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis. And fourth measure, fourth beat - D. Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis. Do you have that?
I think so.
Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C. Con-fu-ta-tis. Second measure, fourth beat on D. Ma-le-dic-tis. All right?
Yes.
Now the orchestra. Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses. Identical notes and rhythm. The first bassoon and tenor trombone -
It couldn't be simpler.
First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
With the tenors.
Also identical?
And that's all?
Do you have me?
I think so.
That's wonderful!
C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C. Sopranos above. Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis.
Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
Yes, and on 'dictis'.
And that's it. Do you have it?
You go fast!
Do you have it?
Yes.
Do you want to rest a bit?
Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
I'm not leaving you.
I am so ashamed.
What for?
Oh? Have I seen it?
I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately.
You mean in Turkey?
Exactly.
Then why especially does it have to be in German?
What you think, Mozart, is scarcely the point. It is what His Majesty thinks that counts.
That will do, Herr Mozart!
Mozart! Herr Mozart, may I have a word with you please. Right away.
Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
Exactly. A dance.
But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
What are you doing, Herr Director?
Can we see the scene with the music back, please?
What is this, Herr Chamberlain?
What is what?
Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.
Because His Majesty wishes it.
Is the Emperor angry with me?
On the contrary.
Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
No, but I'm the best.
A little modesty would suit you better.
Who is on this committee?
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!
Mozart -
They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid.
Mozart -
Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!
Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
Herr Mozart -
I don't think it was really decided, Director.
My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?
Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine.
Mozart -
Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?
Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish? Surely you can choose more elevated themes?
Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
What do you want?
I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.
About what?
You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
So?
In the sight of God that is a sin.
What do you want?
Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
Leave me alone.
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
Are they?
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
I do not seek forgiveness.
My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.
How well are you trained in music?
I know a little. I studied it in my youth.
Where?
Here in Vienna.
I can't say I do. What is it?
Well?
I regret it is not too familiar.
Oh, I know that! That's charming! I didn't know you wrote that.
I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
Ah - you've heard that?
All Vienna has heard that.
And do they believe it?
Is it true?
Do you believe it?
Do you hear me?
It was incomprehensible. What was God up to? Here I was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve God's gift and there was Mozart indulging his in all directions - even though engaged to be married! - and no rebuke at all! Was it possible I was being tested? Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense,
Did you try?
Yes, Father. Yes! So much for my vow of chastity. What did it matter? Good, patient, hard-working, chaste - what did it matter? Had goodness made me a good composer? I realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art. And I was nothing to God.
You cannot say that!
No? Was Mozart a good man?
God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know.
All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? Go on, tell me! Speak for Him!
My son, no one can speak for God.
Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!
I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.
What?
His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by
Yes.
Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery by confessing to murder? You didn't kill him.
I did.
No, you didn't!
I poisoned his life.
But not his body.
What difference does that make?
My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?
No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned
Oh my son, my poor son!
I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.
Yes?
Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
You mean that play?
Exactly.
He's setting that play to music?
Yes.
Are you absolutely sure?
I've seen the manuscript.
Where?
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.
Incredible.
What anger?
About the ballet.
Ballet? What ballet?
Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
Bravo, Your Majesty!
Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.
I know we banned this play, but frankly I can't remember why. Can you refresh my memory, Herr Director?
For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.
Oh yes, yes. And that was?
Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.
Here I am, my angel.
What? Who the devil are you?
I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you.
I can't wait.
Well, promise then.
What do you mean - now?
Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough?
This is embarrassing, you know. You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them. It has to stop.
I agree, Baron.
Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?
No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him.
How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.
Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.
Who is she?
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
That lady is back, sir.
What does he want?
He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.
Herr Salieri.
Yes, I am looking after him.
Can we come in?
Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
But he's all right?
Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.
Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
Of course.
And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times.
Bene.
I'll call tomorrow.
Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh?
Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?
The American? Yes, duck.
How did he look?
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?
I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.
Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago.
Can I be of service, Miss Price?
Dr. Hirsch?
Go about your duties.
Oh, Miss Price?
Yes, Doctor?
What exactly did he call out?
He said 'Jack'.
That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.
What happened to them?
The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.
Did he say a wolf?
It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have.
Oh dear girl, your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me. I don't give a damn who you sleep with. I'm concerned about David.
Yes, sir.
It's a full moon. Where is he?
He's not?
Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
Has his friend appeared to him again?
Yes.
What did he say?
David says Jack comes to warn him.
Warn him?
Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?
I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where
Yes.
They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.
And what else?
You've absolutely no idea where David might be?
Surely you're not suggesting...
David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?
Dr. Hirsch?
Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.
What shall we do?
He's here.
Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
The zoo? Is he rational?
Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.
Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?
No, why?
Is David acting strangely?
Could you get here without any trouble?
Yes, I should think so.
Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital. Do you understand?
Yes, Doctor.
You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
He's fine. We'll come right over.
Shall I send a car?
No, a cab will be faster.
What shall we do?
Nurse Hobbs said there's a disturbance in Leicester Square involving some sort of mad dog.
David?
It wasn't a lunatic.
I beg your pardon?
It was a wolf.
What?
Mr. Kessler?
Yes?
You haven't eaten your lunch.
I'm not very hungry, thank you.
I'm afraid you have to eat something.
Please, really. I'm not hungry.
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
How is that?
Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?
Leave the pills. I'll take them later.
Aw come on, Miss Price!
Call me Alex.
Aw come on, Alex!
Call me David.
Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.
Let's try a little harder, shall we?
You're a very beautiful girl.
I thought you were asleep.
I was. What are you reading?
'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.
Do you like it?
What do you dream about?
I dream of death mostly.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
How old are you?
That's not really a very proper question.
How old are you?
Twenty-eight.
I'm twenty-seven.
I know.
Now what do you want to talk about?
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
My best friend. My very best friend.
Shall I read to you?
What? Oh, yes, please.
A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?
Yes, go on.
Hello. You all right?
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
That's easy enough.
I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.
David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.
Will you come with me?
What?
I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.
Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.
Will you think about it?
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
Not just a patient -- me.
You're being awfully forward, aren't you?
Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it.
All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
Now I'm embarrassed.
I'm a werewolf.
Are you better now?
I'll let you know the next full moon.
My friend Jack was just here.
Your dead friend Jack?
Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
I was dreaming again?
I would think so.
The kitchen.
Closet.
Charming.
Bathroom.
Lovely.
The bedroom.
There is only one bed.
It's nice to see you.
Alex?
Yes?
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
Of course.
David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really?
I was awake and he was in my room.
But, David.
Tomorrow is the full moon.
Let me go now, you'll make me late.
Do me an enormous favor?
Anything.
Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
Werewolves simply do not exist.
David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?
Okay.
I've left those pills for you.
I'm off. There's food in the fridge.
David! Where on earth have you been!?!
Alex, I've lost my mind. I woke up at the zoo! But you know what? I feel terrific!
The zoo?
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
Don't you remember?
The next corner we can get a cab.
I should be committed.
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
But...
David, what are you doing?
Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.
I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right. I...
Jack is dead!
David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.
He's playing a stupid joke, sir.
What?
We had an argument. He's being silly.
Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and...
Hopeless. It's hopeless.
Leave me alone, dammit! You people are crazy! I've got to get away from here! I've got to do something!
David, don't lose control.
Hello, Benjamin.
No.
No what?
No.
Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.
Feeling better?
No.
The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.
No.
How are we feeling tonight?
No.
No what?
No!
Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?
No.
He all right?
Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
He's an American, you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him.
Chart says he's from New York.
I think he's a Jew.
Why on earth do you say that?
I looked.
Miss Price.
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?
Has he been refusing food?
Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.
Officer, I killed those people last night.
All right, you two, move along.
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
There's no call for that kind of language.
Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit!
Now see here young man.
Who is this girl?
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
Why are you doing this to me, Jack?
This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.
Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.
That's easy for you to say - you're already dead.
No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.
Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?
You be quiet, woman, and let me speak.
All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.
Oh, come on, tell us.
Oh, all right. There was this airplane over the Atlantic on its way to New York. It was full of men from the United Nations.
No one brought them here! No one wanted them here!
Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.
Now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the morning.
What time is it?
It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.
Alex?
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
What are you going to see?
An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.
Do you have bad dreams, too?
Some, everyone does.
Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
Hello, David. I am Dr. Hirsch and this is a countryman of yours, Mr. Collins.
Where am I?
You're in a hospital in London.
London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
Miss Price! Miss Price, please!
How long have I been here?
You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.
Two weeks?
You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. You'll have some dueling scars to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. They say a mad man has the strength of ten.
Lunatic?
There were witnesses?
So they said.
How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.
In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
You've never had bad dreams before?
Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you?
I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.
Yes.
Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
Did you see Jack?
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
I really don't know.
Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.
You really think I'm crazy, don't you?
Dr. Hirsch? I'd rather not be by myself.
Are you cold?
Yes.
Jack.
David.
You're not having a good time are you?
Well, I like it here.
I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?
I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.
She's a jerk.
You're talking about the woman I love.
I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.
Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?
I don't know.
Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared...
If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.
I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.
It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
The Slaughtered Lamb?
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?
That's a wolf's head.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?
That's not a spear. It's a pike.
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.
I assume full responsibility.
Okay.
Hello.
Nice looking group.
Listen, at least it's warm in here.
What about it?
It's a five-pointed star.
Ask them what the candles are for.
You ask them.
Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.
I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.
Right.
Go on, ask them.
Jack, we'd better go.
Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!
What the hell was that all about?
I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.
Beware the moon?
That was weird. I guess leaving was the best idea.
I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.
What do you think was wrong?
I have no idea.
Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
Say, David...
Did you hear that?
I heard that.
Could be a lot of things.
Yeah?
A coyote.
There aren't any coyotes in England.
The Hound of the Baskervilles.
Pecos Bill.
Heathcliffe.
Heathcliffe didn't howl.
No, but he was on the moors.
I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.
Shit! David, what is that?
I don't know. Come on.
Come on, where?
It's moving.
What's the plan?
Plan?
It's in front of us.
Oh shit. What is that?
Nice doggie. Good boy.
Walk away, Jack.
See anything?
It sounds far away.
Jack?
Yeah.
Where are we going?
I'll tell you when we get there.
You really scared me, you shithead.
Nice to see you.
Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
Thanks a lot.
This is too much. I can't handle this.
David! You're hurting my feelings.
Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!
I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.
Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?
Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.
Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
Debbie Klein cried a lot.
I can't stand it.
So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.
Rudy Levine the shmuck?
I'm going completely crazy.
David!
What?!
David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you.
Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.
If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead!
We were attacked by a werewolf.
I'm not listening!
On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.
Shut up, you zombie!
I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.
What's wrong with you? Shut up!
The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
It's you, David.
What?!
You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'
Stop it, Jack.
Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days.
Jack, please go away. Please go away.
You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue!
David, please believe me. You will kill people, David. You've got to stop the bloodshed before it begins.
Nurse!
Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance.
Nurse!
The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me.
Nurse! Oh God! Alex!
You're not real.
What are you doing here?
I wanted to see you.
Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
Yes.
Get out of here, Jack!
David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become...
A monster. I know, I know.
You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late.
Jack, are you really dead?
What do you think?
I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.
You must believe me.
What, Jack? That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people? Bullshit!
The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life!
Hi, Jack.
What can I say, Jack?
You don't have to say anything.
Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
If I was still alive, I probably would.
You look awful.
Thank you.
I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.
What about the zoo?
Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.
David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly.
Hello.
Because this must be stopped.
I could hang myself.
Dr. Hirsch?
No, thank you, Doctor.
You were saying?
Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?
The forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved, that's true, but I hardly think...
What can we do to assist you?
Yes?
Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.
Excuse me. Yes?
Roger Mathison, Doctor.
What here?
He's on the telephone.
Hello, there. What can I get you?
Campari and soda would do nicely.
Sorry, love.
What's that?
Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.
Do you have any hot soup?
Hot chocolate?
We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea.
Then you have some hot tea?
No.
Oh.
Remember the Alamo?
No, thank you.
Sorry.
He may have a point, Lieutenant. Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man.
Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting that David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider your
Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and...
And what, Sergeant?
I don't rightly know, sir.
I cannot accept a connection between David Kessler and last night's murders. We will find him, however. I can assure you of that.
Hello, Tom.
What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money!
Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
Tom, I never had trouble getting credit from you before. When I was flat broke you gave me all the money I wanted. Now I come to you with a swell deal, and the greatest
I'll tell you why. I don't like the crowd you're mixed up with. Personally, you can have all the credit you want. But for that deal - not a cent.
What's the idea of turning her down? It sounds like a perfectly safe investment.
She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
If she can't pay, I'll have to foreclose, won't I?
Yes - sure
Oscar, what's the matter?
I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.
No kidding?
No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.
Where's Matt?
Matt?
Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
The detectives got Matt up there in Sampson's office.
He has?
Say Matt, I'll have to have some money for those Manville payrolls.
How much?
About twenty-four thousand.
It was more than that last week.
Yeah.
Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie?
Yeah.
Let me have ten bucks?
Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
Charlie!
I'll pay it back to you Saturday - on the level I will. Give a guy a break, will you? I've got to get it back in my account. If Helen ever finds out that I
Whose death?
It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression?
Where you been?
What's the matter, Charlie?
I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too.
I remember once when your account checked.
And listen, wise guy - I'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the morning.
Mr. Dickson in yet?
Not yet, Mr. Clark.
When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
Yes, sir.
And tell him not to delay.
Personally, I think you're getting panic-stricken about nothing. Dickson's all right.
Don't make me laugh, Schultz!
Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust
What good will that do?
How are you protecting your depositors? By making a lot of idiotic loans!
You know Dickson as well as we do. He'll shut the doors before he gives up control.
Say, you know, I found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball. You've got to hit with the left hand, and from the inside out, it's the only way you can hit anything
I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind.
What's the matter with my policy? How many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years? I'll tell you. Not a single one! What's wrong with that kind of banking?
Character, hmmpf! That's your idea?
Most of the creditors I know personally. I've seen them grow up in the community. I knew their fathers and mothers before them.
I'm running this bank my way. Get that clear!
Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes. He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith!
We want to talk to you.
What about?
We'll be forced to shut the doors. I've worked twenty-five years night and day to keep this bank alive. You've all made money out of it. Are you willing to help?
What do you mean, help?
I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes.
That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
The depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you. You thought they were your friends. Why don't you go out there now and try and get some help from them?
Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.
No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can
Say, you can't do that
Dickson, I'd like to talk to you about the bank.
Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!
We've been waiting fifteen minutes
I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr. Cluett.
Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
That is simple, isn't it? I assume you can prove that if necessary.
Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?
If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see, she's married.
Oh!
You understand?
Thanks.
Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming "Mother Machree."
Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot. Drop that gun.
Don't be a fool, Cluett. This is only going to make it worse for you.
What were you doing at Finlay's this morning?
I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. Dickson. I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered around in a daze. All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . . . You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr. Dickson? You won't go back on me now, will you? I'll die if they send me to prison!
Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
I didn't kill him! I had nothing to do with that, I tell you! I was home in my apartment last night - I can prove it!
Claims he was there with a married woman. Doesn't want to mention her name.
Confessed! Cluett, in heaven's name, what got into you?
I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.
What happened? You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?
Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars!
Fifty thousand dollars!
What was my wife doing in your apartment last night?
Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.
You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?
She wasn't to blame, Mr. Dickson. It wasn't her fault. Honest, it wasn't. I begged her to come up. She didn't
You know what we do to welchers, Cluett, don't you?
I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have been crazy! I lost my head completely!
That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
Then what did you want to gamble for? If you'd have beat us out of fifty G's, you'd have been paid, wouldn't you? Well, we want our dough.
I'm sorry, Dude, butI
That don't do us any good.
But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.
Good heavens, man! You're not suggesting that I
Why not?
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
What do you mean?
Dude - there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there?
You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
know, but
Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?
This won't do. Not during business hours . . .
What is the matter with you? You're trembling?
Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason why I should be, unless of course it's you . . .
Me?
Being alone with you has always done this to me. You know that.
For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you .
Well, you can. You always could.
Here, here, here, now! Don't you go back to work on me, too. I'm getting tired of this. Besides, it's beginning to affect your looks
What is?
running around. Not your work. You'd better start reforming, Cyril!
If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.
Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know something? I've always been curious about your line.
Line?
Come on Cyril, try a little bit of it out on me. I haven't had any first-class blarney thrown at me since the day I was married.
But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned.
Doesn't that come next?
Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
Oh! Oh, no! I think I've done enough experimenting for one day. Congratulations, Cyril. You've convinced me that you're a philanderer of the very first order. I shall recommend you highly.
But I'm giving a party for him - a real, old-fashioned surprise party. Caps, bells, whistles, and everything. I'm really terribly excited about it. I've been planning it for months.
Well
Well, what?
Well, aren't you going to invite me?
You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.
Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway.
Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.
No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.
Why are you so anxious?
Don't you know?
No.
What?
Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?
Now wait a minute, wait a minute...
I've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson.
Why, Cyril, you're insane
No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer
What's this?
My apartment.
I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.
Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink, then we'll go.
No. I know the answer to that one. I think you'd better take me home.
What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank?
No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals I think I will have a drink.
You know, there ought to be a Congressional Medal for men like you. America's comfort to misunderstood wives. I never thought I would find myself in that class.
Oh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.
What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]
And now fair woman, I have you in my power.
I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
Why, Matt!
Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?
Yes, sir.
Let me see your cash book, will you?
Now?
The butler said I could stay. I told him it was important.
Well, I thought I'd like to have a little talk with you.
I'm listening.
Anything you have to say to me, you can say in the morning.
I'm not interested in what you think.
You've no right to do this to her, Mr. Cluett. Why don't you think it over? It's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble.
I tell you, I'm not interested in your opinion.
Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything. You'd do well to mind your own business.
This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me. What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?
That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
John, how's your wife this morning?
Much better this morning, thank you.
Excuse me
Wait a minute. How do you feel this morning?
I'm feeling fine this morning.
That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
Shall we let the people come in?
Good morning, Mr. Dickson. My wife is much better this morning.
Well, look who's here! Hello, dear.
If this isn't a red-letter day for Tom Dickson! First I trample on the Board of Directors, then I promote Matt here to assistant cashier, and now to complete the day I have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife. What a man, what a man!
It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.
What's the matter dear? What have I done now?
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
Yes.
Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it.
But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.
Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.
The theatre?
That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?
Yes, of course.
You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn
Ho! Ho! Ho!
Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.
Listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .
Well . . .
Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?
All right. I'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.
Happy now?
Listen, dear. I want to ask you something. I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you, but . . . I want you to tell me the truth. Where were you last night?
Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .
Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Good morning.
Helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about it?
I don't know.
Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married?
Why - well, I
Ummm. Stalling, eh? Anything new?
Why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room.
Longer.
Helen, tell Matt I want to see him.
Oh, Mr. Dickson - they're going to arrest Matt. They think he did it!
Where is he now?
In Mr. Sampson's office.
Come on in here, Helen. Bring your book. I want some numbers to try to get some action. Get Parker at the Union-Leeds - the Exchange . . . Winslow and old man Harris at the Home Mortgage. Snap into it, Helen. Just as quick as you can.
You want the rest of those numbers, Mr. Dickson?
Good morning, Helen.
Good morning.
Oh!
Yes?
Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?
Yes?
Mr. Sampson . . .
Helen!
Yes?
Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Got my letter?
Yes, thank you.
Mr. Dickson?
But, Mr. Dickson, I thought you were going to take care of the mortgage. I only want ten thousand. The property is worth sixty.
Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?
I haven't any.
You haven't got a uniform?
No, sir.
My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?
Why, I don't know.
Oh, make that uniform blue.
Well, well, well - got your uniform, eh?
Yes, sir.
Looks good. How much did it cost?
It's all right. Thanks.
What's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it.
Sure, I think it's swell.
Aw, I'm sorry, Mr. Dickson. It's just kind of sudden, that's all. Sure, I'm excited. I think it's great. Only, well, you've done so much for me already . . . I'll never be able to thank you enough.
Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?
Well, I
I already told him I was home.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Matt, do you realize you're up against something? You're being charged with murder. It's serious, son. Now come on, I know you didn't do it. But we've got to make them believe it. Come on, tell the truth, where were you last night?
No. I won't.
You're protecting somebody.
No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!
We haven't got much time left, Mr. Dickson. We've got to do something quick or it'll be too late.
Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?
You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?
Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?
Was Mrs. Dickson there?
Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do is
Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
Well . . . uh . . . I . . .
She was, wasn't she? How long has this been going on? Do you know?
Aw, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your bank and
I want you both to take the day off. Go downtown and get a license and get married right away!
But I haven't . . .
Helen, while you're downtown, you might stop in and make reservations for the bridal suite on the Berengaria sailing next week.
What's the matter? What's going on here? This is ridiculous! You can't hold this boy on a vague suspicion.
I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.
Why pick on him ?
It's an inside job. That's a cinch. Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. Now Brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?
What time did this thing happen?
The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.
All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
If he can do it, yes.
That's what he says. I got a man from headquarters checking up on it now.
All I know is the bank's been robbed and a murder's been committed. The way I see it, Brown here looks guilty.
What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.
Maybe. But I'm taking no chances. Why, this kid's got a record.
Of course it's true - and he knows it.
You were right, Mr. Dickson! Brown didn't have anything to do with it. Here's your man.
Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.
My wife? What's she got to do with you?
You're lying!
Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.
Well, Sampson, what is it?
Good. I'll take this along with me. Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm sick and tired of the delay.
I'm afraid he's been stalling.
That's just exactly what he has been doing. This deal should have been closed weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .
He says he can't get away in the daytime.
How about his nights? He's too busy running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow night open, come in and sign this thing, or I'll call this whole deal off.
The lobby's half filled now.
They've been coming in steady all morning. I have called for some extra police.
All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
The bank's reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel after that. This is just a flurry, that's all. They've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken. Listen, get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash. Wait a minute. Get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too. Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be
Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're going crazy.
Did you get the case for the securities?
Yes, sir.
Mine too?
The fools! If they only knew it, they're making things worse for themselves. Somebody starts a silly rumor, and they lose their heads.
What'll we do?
We can't keep open till four o'clock. We haven't cash enough to last an hour.
Mr. Dickson! Mr. Dickson!
Get all the big bills in the place. Take them out and get them changed. Get nothing but ones and fives. Distribute them among the tellers. Tell them to take their time. Stall as much as possible. Count and recount the money.
Yes, sir.
Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money here.
Is it safe?
Absolutely.
Quiet down, please! Take it easy, folks. Everything will be all right.
But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!
How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson.
Is that busy husband of mine busy?
He's at a board meeting.
Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.
I'm afraid so.
Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
No.
Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless! If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?
Oh, well. I guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite. When he comes out, you tell him I'll be back. He hasn't gotten rid of me!
Hello, Helen!
Matt, come here!
Why?
Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!
What did you do with it?
With what?
The ten dollars.
Oh, ten dollars
Yes.
No.
Oh, you think I'm lying?
Yes.
All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar.
Say, I just heard the merger isn't going thru. Isn't that grand?
What happened? What did he say? Did you get the job?
What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death.
Come here. You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.
Well . . . ?
Oh Matt, you must be mistaken.
In Cluett's office?
What's keeping you?
Oh, Charlie again.
Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?
Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]
Oh now, don't be silly.
Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.
Now you've got me worried, dear. Promise me you won't butt in.
Shh . . . ! I'll wait for you upstairs.
Oh, Matt . . .
What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help?
Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
They must have turned him down.
Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
Did you talk to him?
Dickson's in a jam I tell you. The run's getting worse.
Mr. Williams . . .
The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him, Mr. Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him, who is going to help him?
Did you say Dude Finlay?
Yes, why?
He was in the bank yesterday.
He was here?
He came to see Mr. Cluett.
Are you sure?
What did you find out, Mike?
I've been trailing the cashier like you told me. You're right about that guy, chief. There's something screwy somewhere.
Never mind all that. What did you find out?
He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint.
Dude Finlay?
Do you know this young man, Mrs. Halligan?
for the rheumatism, you know.
What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?
What time was it?
Huh?
What time did Matt Brown get in?
Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after
I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in?
That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . .
Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause...
It couldn't have been earlier?
No. It wasn't earlier because...
Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet.
No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.
Listen here, young man - nobody ever called me a liar yet and got away with it
You turned off the burglar alarm, you set the time clock, came back at twelve and emptied the boxes, didn't you?
wasn't anywhere near this place
Sit down! When the watchman surprised you, you shot him - what'd you do with the gun?
I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!
Then who changed it?
So you were home last night?
Yes.
What time did you get in?
Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.
Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
But I wasn't here, Mr. Dickson. Honest I wasn't . . .
You're carrying too much money on you, Hank. You better turn some in tonight.
How are you fixed?
I'm okay, Matt.
That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.
Yeah, what did he do with his first one?
Everybody in?
I guess so.
Where's Charlie?
Certainly, Mr. Jones! Certainly! Charlie!
You can ride like that?
I think I may just go on to the reservation.
I couldn't lose him.
This is healing?
Sometimes a wound will kill.
Gatling! They've got a Gatling!
He's smiling.
Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty.
Your Ma wouldn't let us leave until we ate something.
Here's Liberty's favorite son! I'll never forget what you did, cousin.
Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite.
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
These are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad.
Uhh, yeah it does.
No, Jimmy has a point. The Younger-James Gang could be confusing.
How?
We got a problem here, brother?
That's what the newspapers say. Weren't for Jesse James, this gang wouldn't be able to find a goat's ass with a stick.
This is the best score yet.
It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve.
Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean.
How'd they --
What have you done?
I ain't done --
Bob. I didn't...
Swear.
I swear --
I'm sorry, Cole.
Things changed when you quit the gang. For example, I'm now the one who says "Let's ride."
He's not bad at it.
My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you.
Yesterday.
Corn gonna shoot at me?
Nope.
Jesus mercy, that's Charlie Higgins, Dave Laller ...
Cole, I want to get to the farm, make sure Little Jim and the girls are okay.
They came up, made the same offer they made you folks. Our little brother Jim tried to chase 'em off, one of those detectives hit him in the head, knocked him out. Cole lost his temper.
Oh no...
Damn!
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
The Army can hang him.
Home. We go home. We ride like hell to get there, and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes. And when we get there we stay there and God help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again.
How many of them did he kill?
You have no shame.
But if we take their money and supplies...
All right, settle down. All this money ain't ours.
Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it. You explain it to him.
"The outlaws calling themselves the James-Younger Gang shot their way out of town, wounding the Sherriff and three other townsfolk."
Hey!
Okay, folks, I think we know how this is going to go...
Beg pardon?
This is about the "Wanted!" Posters, isn't it.
The things a fella has to do to get a little respect around here...
You are a fine figure of a man.
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem. It's Cole.
He's been full of vinegar lately.
He's planning a job.
What?
Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...
What?
What you sayin' boy?
I think I recognize you.
How?
You shut up now, boy.
'Bout time you got here, buddy.
Ride with me, cousin?
I could use the walk.
Where you boys going?
Home, boys. Back to our farms.
Hands off your hip, Cole.
You're not scared, are you?
Not now.
What is wrong with you?
You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?
She had a moustache.
She was European!
Thanks for the help.
After all you did on our farm? You miss it, don't you Jesse?
The war? What, are you crazy? There are things I miss about it.
It was exciting.
Because we were good at it? Hell, we were great at it. Jesse, don't tell anyone I said this, because everybody knows I'm the toughest man in this town, but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns.
This isn't a feud, this is war. They've got more men than we do. We kill detectives, they can replace 'em in a day.
So what do we do, General Lee?
I'll pick the first job! I mean... I know a girl down at the bank. See if she can't get a list of towns where the railroad keeps its money.
Perfect, Cole.
The James-Younger Gang.
Sorry.
I got seven thousand.
See, Frank's being smart about this.
It's not a bank.
"The Fidelity Bank and Trust was robbed on Tuesday by a gang of twenty heavily armed men."
Jesse, we got to have a word.
Sure, cousin.
All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the "James-Younger Gang."
Yep.
This is your fault for hogging all the publicity.
It'll be the biggest score yet.
Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper.
If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.
What are you saying?
I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.
Beautiful.
Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --
A bad idea.
I got us through the War all right.
And almost got hanged in peacetime.
I'm the better soldier, Jesse.
Still smells fishy.
Fine. We hit this bank.
Dammit!
Okay, you're gonna rest here.
Bob, rip up some bandages.
We'll make them pay for this.
I'm out.
WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!
Missed you, cousin.
You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought --
Where'd you get all these riders?
Some Indian tracker you turned out to be, Tom.
Wait'll we get back to Missouri, start telling those gals about how little Jesse James charged the whole Union Army by himself!
Tom, why don't you stop at our spread before you head on out to the reservation? Figure we might have some work for you, if you want.
Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you...
Well?
Cannon or Gatling?
Both would be nice.
What the --
I think one of 'em's glass.
Which one, right or left?
Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's...
I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice.
Shakespeare. He's European.
BASTARDS! Come back here and face me!
Hey! We decide something, that's it! We're in this for the long haul, and this idea of me and Jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. We've got to think --
Strategically.
Jesse.
Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride?
Another dozen out back.
They gonna rush us?
The safe. Now.
Of course! Uh, sir?
What?
Where is Jesse James?
OPEN THE DAMN SAFE!
You 'um big lawman?
Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
Of St. Louis?
Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock.
East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?
Go ahead to the saloon. But don't get too drunk!
I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!
You're right, sir.
Then why can't I go in there?
On account of we're robbing it.
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
It's a secret.
Fine. I'll just wait here.
What the --
What is it?
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
So?
Where the hell were you?
I had you covered. From back there.
-- rode right into them, screaming like a banshee.
My little Web did that?
Web died fighting?
Boys...
What do you say, sir?
You know you're welcome any time!
Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here. But out.
Daddy, don't start with this again.
He's going to be fine, right Daddy?
They're gone. What are you --
I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
He thinks this is some kind of game!
Every time I put my head up to hit that Gatling, they try to shoot it off.
Distracting enough for you?
Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.
Mm-hmm.
Such as?
You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats.
That would have made an impression.
I figure.
See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it.
Web's dead.
I reckoned.
Hell of a war.
Hello, Liberty Missoura!
Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got.
Frank, don't you have something to say?
You're doing just fine.
Whyyyy... he took down the Gatling gun and the cannon all by himself.
All we thought about was coming home. I swore I'd kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again. If I have to go to war with the railroad to stay, fine by me.
Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right.
That just might work.
"Big and older"?
You can shut up now.
You are a charmer.
I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
She's still talking to Jesus.
-- if you stop saying things about my Zee.
You know him?
I went up to the courthouse and looked at the right of way documents for the rail bed. The railroad doesn't even need our land, they're just taking the land on both sides for as far as they can.
You ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming?
What do you think?
You're looking a bit more spry now that somebody --
Pinkertons. It's the railroad.
... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else.
Don't care.
Didn't think you would. I'm going to go make the coffin.
How'd it go in there?
Fine. How'd it go out here?
And I planned getting you off the hangman's deck --
And it's guarded by Pinkerton detectives.
I don't think it's counterfeit. Do you mind if I take a look at all your real bills to compare?
Gents, we are in the middle of something here.
Bob's upset.
Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control!
This has been a good year.
Jesse, we're outlaws.
And we're good at it.
It got to you, didn't it. All the killing in the war. You need it now.
You've killed your fair share of men.
If I could go back to farming --
That's a lie. You could've bought a dozen farms with the money we've stolen.
I can't quit and leave you alone. I can't quit until you quit. Ma would've wanted it that way.
We're doing this for Ma.
Maybe it started out that way. But now...
What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming.
We're drunk.
Oh yeah.
You taking sides against me, now, Frank?
They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door.
Shoulda learned with Web. Made it look fun, made it look like an adventure. Got Web killed. Now Jim.
Jim was old enough...
He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?
Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.
You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
Yeah.
A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
I'll meet you down there in a few weeks.
See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
Y'know, Uncle Frank...
Yeah, Jimmy?
...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.
Allow a man his version of the past. When you get to be my age, you've got enough painful memories, you're allowed to soften a few of the edges up.
Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
That he was.
They're making him a hero now.
Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
But he killed a lot of men, too.
Can't argue that.
So what was he?
Uncle Frank?
Yeah Jimmy?
How much of that story is true?
Did you kill Yankees?
A fair number, Ma.
Ma, I'm glad to see you being nice to our Injun friend.
Easterners.
The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard, nobody'll ever find them.
Ma! Please!
Riders --
We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
Doc Mimms will --
Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?
You were little Jesse James when you left.
But still died.
Jesse, are you awake?
Jesse, is that your hand?
You shouldn't be up.
I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.
You're sick of my company?
No! I mean, of course not. No.
Teasing you is completely unfair.
What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.
I shouldn't tease a hero.
What?
Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you, Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're everybody's hero.
I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.
So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?
I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older.
You didn't want to farm?
I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate.
A river pirate.
Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
Thank God you grew out of that. You did grow out of that, didn't you?
Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.
You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
Not if I find the right girl.
And what's this right girl like?
Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.
Where will you find such a girl?
Ahem. "From this doctrine..." No, ah... "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive, they sparkle still like ... shiny... sparkling rocks..."
Sparkling rocks?
Little ones.
Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems you're trying to quote?
Yep.
Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
I am so sorry, Jesse.
You and I, we've started... something, you know? I don't know what'll happen if you do this.
Me neither.
Let the law --
Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
Whose justice? Yours or God's? When will you stop?
Zee.
Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
I don't understand.
She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.
That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...
I would never have imagined us in a place like this.
That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.
Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?
I've got you. You keep me busy. I figure we'll get over to the hotel... get checked in, cleaned up... then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a long time.
Hmm.
"Hmm" what?
I beg your pardon?
"Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James." Only a dime in the hotel lobby.
Let me see that.
Oh, I'm not finished. "When he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold, the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple." As I said. Hmm.
Now, sweetie, y'all wouldn't go believing one of them silly dime novels, would you?
Jesse, have you ever noticed that when you're trying to charm your way out of trouble, your accent gets all farm boy?
Aw, shucks, ma'am...
Stop it. This is just sad.
Don't turn around.
What?
You get arrested again, I'll kill you.
Yes ma'am.
I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
You are a hell of a woman.
Don't swear.
Tennessee?
We're moving you tomorrow.
But I like the presidential suite.
Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.
So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?
Did you order our houses burned down?
You almost ended my career before it began.
How did you spot the ambush in Torrell?
Last February?
Mmm.
You had all those cattle there, so I'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive?
Yes?
The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town.
Almost got me in Billings. I saw you there, shooting at me.
I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.
Oh. That's nice to know. We're going to hang you, you know.
I figured.
Was it worth it?
Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.
That's what I would have done.
I'm not hanged yet.
You cocky little bastard.
Ahh, you'll miss me.
That was for my Ma. Now this is for everybody else.
The railroad has no business in Tennessee. Therefore I have no interest in the state of Tennessee.
Thanks.
I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my time.
This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation.
The Lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable. "Jesse Woodson James." Jesse James? The Jesse James?
I could have lied I suppose, but I want this marriage to be legal. I just want you to know, I'm trying to start a new life here. I'm depending on your...
Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth.
Thank you.
Now let's have a drink.
Right here in church?
And you're too young.
I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.
I like that.
You okay, Jesse?
Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.
Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink.
I guess so.
Jim, you been with a girl yet?
Well, not exactly.
You been with a girl ever?
Hell yeah! I been with... Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?
I think so.
You and Frank and Cole, and even Bob, get all these girls because you're good looking and famous. You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby brother. Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse?
I swear.
Tell you something else. I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up.
What about that Rock Island bastard?
... too young for whisky...
This time we'll make an exception.
Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...
Why, yeah.
I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.
Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
Really?
I hope I'm not being too forward.
Not at all.
I just though you were awful cute.
Thank you, Miss -- ?
Lyla Devereux.
Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?
Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once.
Really?
Well, this land is about to be condemned.
Relax, Alan. The Army has this all in hand. And Mr. Thaddeus Rains will be very pleased with this news. Nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate.
My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time.
They had to be dealt with!
How can that be?
There's only four of them...
Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir, it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field.
And it is my pleasure to be here.
Really!
NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!
Parker, tell me what's going on so I can return as quickly as possible to Boston and my whores and cigars, not necessarily in that order.
Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers.
Good.
Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.
Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.
Yes sir.
Just perfect.
A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.
You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity.
I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.
They exchanged fire with the Pinkerton Guards, killing several of them. Then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile.
How much did they get from the safe?
Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track --
I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!
To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
THEN WHO DID?!
Your men knew the risks.
With my money!
The final route for the railroad is complete.
Parker.
Sir?
What is that?
That.
This is him.
How did you know?
Look at this, Pinkerton! They got the payroll, and this damage will set construction back two months at least.
You wouldn't have done that?
Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too.
I want them arrested and hanged!
Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here, Mr. Rains.
This is no game.
"A Rock Island and Pacific Railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside St. Louis, Missouri. The brave and daring James-Younger Gang was heavily outnumbered by Pinkerton detectives, but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the West."
It is a nice piece of writing.
"The gang made off with thirty-five thousand dollars and also destroyed the Thaxton Switch construction, meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land!" Who wrote this!? I'll see him hanged every Tuesday for a month!
It's early in the game yet, Mr. Rains. Jesse James and I are just learning how each other moves, feeling out each other's patterns.
I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!
Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. They are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create.
So you can't tell me anything?
Pinkerton. It's been eight months. I see robberies. I see hold ups. But I do not see men on the end of nooses.
First of all: you, shut up. Now, you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs.
I can't believe this.
Yes, that's the way to win the locals back to our side.
I demand action.
No, you demand results. They are not the same thing. And if you want results, you will let me do my job as I see fit. Unless of course, You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it?
Can't you tell me anything?
So he's won.
Every three months, the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty, Missouri. They always pull a job right before they return, probably to have extra money to give family and friends.
In English, Pinkerton.
There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed.
Can you put men at all four?
No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.
What is that?
What the hell is that sound?
Listen, what are you doing tonight?
What? Oh, I'm...busy.
Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?
Stop it. I'm...
On a lot of lithium?
Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.
You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when?
Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
Pumpkin?
Yes?
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
Uh huh.
Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York.
I know. Stop it.
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.
Courtney? Dinner?
I can't.
I'm thinking Dorsia.
Dorsia's nice.
Nice?
You like it there, don't you?
The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.
Okay. Yeah. What time?
Eight?
Pick me up?
A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish.
Is that Donald Trump's car?
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.
J&B. Straight.
Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.
Are we here?
Yes.
This is Dorsia?
Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish." You'll love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely.
Luis is a despicable twit.
No, you idiot. I said "Is it a receptacle tip?" Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? Get off me.
Is it a what?
Pull out.
I'm ignoring you.
Pull out, goddamnit!
It's a plain end. I think.
Oh Jesus. I'm going home.
Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.
It's a plain end, see? So?
Take it off.
Why?
Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us. Why is it pulled down half an inch? So it can catch the force of the ejaculate!
See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?
Will you call me before Thanksgiving?
What are you doing tonight?
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
That's nice.
You and...Luis?
We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...
I never knew you smoked.
Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?
You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.
Isn't that special? Patrick?
Patrick?
Yes?
I haven't seen you around here.
You just haven't been looking.
Do you want to come to my apartment or not?
I'm not supposed to. But I can make an exception.
You have a really nice place here...Paul. How much did you pay for it?
I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time...
Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.
Nothing like last time, promise.
So, you're looking great, how have you been?
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
Really?
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
This is nicer than your other apartment.
Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.
Do...what.
Get married. Have a wedding.
Evelyn?
Yes, darling?
Is your Evian spiked?
We should do it.
No-I can't take the time off work.
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
I don't want to talk about it.
Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just quit? You don't have to work.
Pat, this is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist.
Why don t you just go for Price?
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
He's rich.
Everybody's rich.
He's good-looking.
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
He has a great body
Are you using minoxidil?
No. I'm not. Why should I ?
Your hairline looks like it's receding.
I want a firm commitment.
Why? What's wrong?
We need to talk.
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
It's over, Evelyn. It's all over
Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work. You have a little something on your upper lip.
You're really serious, aren't you?
Yes, I am.
But what about the past? Our past?
We never really shared one.
You're inhuman.
No, no, no.
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now.
Oh God, I can't believe this.
Where are you going?
I'm just leaving.
But where?
You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van
Picked them up from the printers yesterday
Good coloring.
Eggshell with Romalian type. What do you think?
But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do you think, Bateman?
Because he dated her.
How did you guess?
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?
Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
Listen, what about dinner?
Are you my two o'clock?
Can I help you?
Doesn't he live here?
No, he doesn't.
Are you sure?
You saw the ad in the Times?
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
I think you should go now.
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
Don't come back.
Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back. He approaches Carnes cautiously.
Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it?
Yes, naturally.
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?
What exactly do you mean?
By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right?
Carnes? Wait.
Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must...
Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true.
Excuse me. I really must he going.
Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer
But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
It's just not.
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.
No, you...didn't?
Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney. Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a reservation there?
Lucky, I guess.
That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?
Uh huh.
It looks so soft.
Patrick? Is that you?
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it. Where did you get your overnight bag?
Call me please, Patrick.
What...is...it?
Where are you going?
I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.
Patrick?
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?
That's Paul Owen.
There's this theory out now that if you can catch the AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected, then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for Christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy-
I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus.
Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?
Maybe it's just the light.
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram? Oh my God...
What?
It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do enough of it we'll be okay.
SHUT UP!
Calm down. Let's do it anyway
Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more important problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign policy is important, but there are more pressing problems at hand.
Like what?
What's that, a gram?
I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.
Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...
Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's at Tunnel.
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.
Leaving what?
Don't, I'll drink it.
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?
I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!
Don't tell me...merchant banking?
No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing.
And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about?
Dorsia.
Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight?
Dorsia, yes?
We are totally booked.
Oh really? That's great.
I said we are totally booked.
Two at nine? Perfect.
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.
Late?
Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why.
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
When?
After six.
Oh? And what should I say?
Just...say...no.
Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All right?
Oh, something. . romantic?
No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.
I'll do it.
No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?
Yes?
Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again.
Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.
You don't like this, I take it?
Come on, you're prettier than that.
What is it?
Patrick?
Ye-es, Je-an?
Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.
Who?
Tell him I'm at lunch.
Patrick?
Yes, Patrick?
Jean?
Yes, Patrick?
That is...if you're not doing anything.
Oh no. I have no plans.
Anywhere you want?
Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
No, come on. Anywhere you want.
Oh, I can't. I don't know.
Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...
Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.
Yes? You're dressed...okay.
You didn't give them a name.
Jean? Sorbet?
Want a bite?
I'm on a diet. But thank you.
You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit.
You can always he thinner. Look...better.
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.
And don't tell me you enjoy working with children, okay?
Do you have a boyfriend?
No, not really.
Interesting.
Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?
Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.
Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie? Had you heard this?
Who's Ted Bundy?
Forget it.
What's that?
Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for... taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun.
What...No! Put it in the carton.
Sorry.
Jean? What?
I'm looking for...I guess you could say I just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.
Yes. I don t think I can...control myself.
If you stay, I think something bad will happen. I think I might hurt you. You don't want to get hurt, do you?
And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21.
Patrick Bateman's office.
Jean? Hello? Jean?
Patrick? Is that you?
Hello? Jean, I need help!
Where are you?
Jean-I'm not-
Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.
Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?
Patrick? I can't hear you.
What are I doing?
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?
...to the office this afternoon.
Why?
Just...say...no!
What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?
So, what do you do?
What do you think I do?
A model? An actor?
No. Flattering, but no.
Well...
Welt...it depends, why?
Oh really? DAISY He said... He said you gave him bad vibes.
That's...that's too bad.
You think I'm dumb, don't you?
What?
You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.
No. I really don't.
Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.
Well.
Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, but you know. They really are the best.
Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You know, like... like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?
Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.
Hubert's? Oh really? It moved uptown, right?
Yeah, well, oh boy, listen, I've got to go. Thank you, uh... Victoria?
Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often.
Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the time.
Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?
Next Saturday?
Yeah.
Oh, can't, I'm afraid. Matinée of Les Miserables. Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call you.
What do you mean, she was a hot number.
She's my...cousin.
Uh huh?
Elizabeth, it's three in the morning.
He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
Don't tell him you're here.
This tastes weird. Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway you'd like. I'm at-
You're at Paul Owen s.
Who?
Paul Owen.
Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?
No.
Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on. What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.
Patrick, you re a lunatic.
Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
Let's not get lewd. I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?
No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening.
Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just walked in... Just joking... No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John, right, got it. Sorry about that.
No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment. Was that anything important?
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
So, what's the topic of discussion?
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.
So it's nothing that official. I just have some basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-
Coffee?
No. I'm okay.
Perrier? San Pellegrino?
KIMBALL.
Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-
Oh no, I'm okay.
Well, what's the topic of discussion?
The disappearance of Paul Owen.
Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything... Not on "Page Six" at least.
I think his family wants this kept quiet.
Understandable. Lime?
No, really. I'm okay.
Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own files, okay?
Shoot.
How old are you?
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
Where did you go to school?
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
Your address?
Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building.
Nice. Very nice.
Pardon me, but are you okay?
Who do you ask?
Bad habit.
Would you rather I not smoke?
No, I guess it's okay.
You sure?
What can you tell me about Paul Owen?
How well did you know him?
I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know.
Yeah...Yale thing.
So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen?
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
What kind of man was he? Besides... the information you've just given.
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
Do you feel that way?
No. Not really.
Where did Paul hang out?
Hang...out?
Yeah. You know...hang out.
Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine. Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular places.
He had a yacht?
No, he just hung out there.
Don't you know this?
Anything else you can tell me about Owen?
We were both seven in 1969.
So was I.
Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London.
Well, maybe he did, huh?
His girlfriend doesn't think so.
But...has anyone seen him in London?
Actually, yes.
Hmmm.
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...
Oh.
Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?
What?
I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-
Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced diet and-
Have you consulted a psychic?
No.
Had his apartment been burglarized?
No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.
I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything.
That's so typical, isn't it?
It's just strange. One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...
Nothing.
People just...disappear.
The earth just opens up and swallows people.
You'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes.
Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I mean aren't you going to be late?
Uh, no. There's one...down here.
Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information at all...
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL Kimball. Call me Don.
Don.
So...you hang out here a lot?
How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for "formal questioning?"
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
I mean they want to get caught.
I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's taken a leave of absence.
Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame. Is he a suspect?
Do you remember where you were on the night of Paul's disappearance? Which was on the twentieth of December?
I had a date with a girl named Veronica.
Wait. That's not what I've got.
What?
That's not the information I've received.
Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?
Let's see... That you were with-
Well, I could he wrong.
Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?
Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.
Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.
Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?
Great, yes, I'd like that.
And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.
Never. I mean...I don't really like... singers.
Not a big music fan, eh?
No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.
Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations.
No hash browns?
Not in the mood, I guess.
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?
Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.
So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did?
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.
And?
I've questioned him.
Marcus?
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
But Marcus denied it?
Yes.
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
He does? You're sure?
I checked it out. It's clean.
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you?
Where was Marcus?
He wasn't with Paul Owen.
So who was he with?
Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner with Victoria...the following night.
I'm so hungry.
It's cold out, too, isn't it?
I'm so hungry.
Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job?
I lost my job...
Gee, uh, that's too bad.
Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?
I'm not...
You're not what? Qualified for anything else?
I'm hungry
I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you.
I'm hungry.
Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? From people who do work?
What am I gonna do?
Listen, what's your name?
Al.
Speak up. Come on.
Al.
Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. I'll help you.
You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell.
Shhhh...it's okay.
Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.
Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.
I can't...I can't find a shelter
Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you?
How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?
It's...it's...all right.
Really? That's interesting. Not great?
Oh well, you know.
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here.
Yeah, well, you're late.
Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.
We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.
So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get it?
And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?
Cecelia is, well...you know
Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.
Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.
Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?
No, man. I'm gonna bail.
You like Huey Lewis and the News?
Hey, Halberstam?
Yes, Owen?
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
No, Owen.
Is that a raincoat?
You think so?
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit?
What shit? Now where do we have reservations at? I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have reservations somewhere.
I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so fucking, I don't know, cool about it?
Is it over?
They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs.
You are a fanatic.
Alice? You gotta make him do the start-up with Teddy and me.
"Make" him?
I'm just screwed.
You know what he's like. He just wants to work on stuff that's cool.
You don't wanna move, do you?
I can't help it. I feel like they'd do anything to keep their --
I think I kind of lost it. I was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest, most powerful... 'Didn't know I even cared about that stuff.
A lot of what Larry says is true. They just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they --
It's important.
If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest.
If my dad'd leveled with me like that even once... The weird thing is, my fantasy he could somehow be like the old Gary? It's his fantasy, too.
I think that's great, Milo. I do.
...But?
Didn't you visit the campus?
I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.
No way. You have this -- destiny.
C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --
Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
When's Brian coming for the TV?
That took some fun out of --
You know he's never been anybody's counselor before?
To our new life. ...What's wrong?
That's what I need to ask you. You know you can't keep anything from me.
It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly.
What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
He's your boss. He's not your --
I know, I know.
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
Isn't that -- extreme?
I mean, if one little comment from Gary is gonna upset you this much --
What!
Teddy was killed last night.
What're you -- what?
Are you saying you think they had something to do with his death? Nelson said it was an airtight case.
I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.
I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.
I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says "Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?" It's like they know what every kid's doing.
They hack into people's programs?
It isn't a broadcast studio. It's -- a surveillance post or something. That's why they have the dishes on top.
You're scaring me. I think we should just go.
Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
"Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about.
You think I don't know that?
Milo. Why would he --
How should I know? "Solving a problem," I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know. I've gotta get in there.
Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and --
It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening. ...gotta get in there.
Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post? And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards --
I can't just walk away!
You can't just walk in, either.
They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five.
I know how to get in there. But you've gotta help me.
...Whaddo I do?
It's almost nine, I've been so worried! What did you see in there?
Nothing.
It's what they said it is. An unfinished broadcast studio. You were right... I just drove to Seattle and back.
...Why?
The Justice Department guy who came to the apartment when --
I remember.
After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary.
Guilt?
If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.
That was -- different.
Where were you? You know you can't keep anything from me.
Look at this.
What?
Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.
He has thousands of employees, Milo --
It's for the Museum. He knows you're a painter. If anybody should be invited --
Milo --
I know you think I'm too attached to him, but still. I am close to Gary. And you're the most meaningful person in my life. I'm going back to the Comix place, why should I be killing myself.
Are you gonna tell me where you went?
No. No. I sent an E-mail to somebody, just now. To tell her how I feel about you. You know I'm clueless, without you. You know I --
Great!
You look beautiful.
Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.
...What?
Milo?
Don't we have any chopsticks?
Here we go.
...wanna savor this.
It's gonna get cold.
Right. Wait. A toast.
'Didn't mention he was going to the Justice Department?
No.
Not like him, is it? To do a thing like that without telling you. You're not losing your hold on him, are you?
He'll tell me when he gets home.
That'll be a test, won't it?
Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.
He said it made sense that Gary's code was like Teddy's, that that cliché about great minds was true. Said it was all about his own guilt. Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while. It always passes.
He wasn't acting?
Don't worry, Milo. I'm here as a friend. Or maybe a supplicant.
Right... What's that mean again?
Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right
It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something...
Mr. Barton, do you remember me?
...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
Yes sir. I need to talk to you.
Milo?
Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
What seems to be the problem? You look a little upset.
Milo?
My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley.
My goodness.
It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?
If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.
I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.
Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area.
'Just didn't know who else to talk to.
And Outpost? You're happy there?
You're living here?
'Thought if I relocated it could help my case. I'm writing programs for the local public access station. Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show? God, does it suck. Can you help me?
Well I parked illegally. See y'later?
This is the biggest Beta demo in like the history of software. You'd be my partner.
You can't pre-empt Yoga, that's our biggest show.
Will I get to work for Outpost?
No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring down Outpost.
What?
Okay.
Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door --
What?!
You're interfaced with our dish.
Is it your software?
What?!
...When did you know?
That's gotta kill him, right?
Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.
Conglomerates're lined up to finance the launch of the remaining satellites. They'll pay him a huge premium to get on-line.
That'd change with a criminal indictment.
There's no hard evidence he knew about this. Anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished.
Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling this guy?
Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you some slack in this world.
And the kid who wrote Skywire -- then gave it away? They're calling him the digital Robin Hood.
Milo. Surprised he's not your guest.
We tried!
Milo? I'm Danny.
'Couldn't convince Teddy to come?
He's pretty tight with his family.
We could move 'em up here.
Who's that?
...Hello?
Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.
Cool!
Would you like a Coke or something?
You know a lot about art, I guess.
I've only shown this to three other people. I bought 200, we've launched 12 so far. I keep the coordinates in this room. It's left over from SDI. Reagan's Star Wars technology? They orbit 426 miles up.
Low enough to relay internet traffic.
Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky?
The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware emerges.
It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?
When you get to a certain age, you start wondering. About your legacy. I doubt you even remember Outpost 1.0 --
I do!
No! Just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself.
'Think I should buy some originals?
...Do I?
Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.
That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
Could work with a new switch. There may be a few more things hidden.
How's it going?
Maybe I'm going too fast.
It's okay. Really.
You did this -- overnight?
Milo. What's up?
Well -- you sent for me.
You really wrote this just today?
What're you implying.
Everything I do is under scrutiny. The questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid. I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead?
I'm sure.
It scales, don't you think?
I heard what happened.
Had you talked to him much lately?
Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure.
Did you?
Talk about work? Never!
I meant did you find other stuff to --
Oh. Yeah.
You've been coming in early.
Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of code there...
Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And it came over me: it's in the wrong place.
The wrong place?
Gary, hi.
You look a little tired.
I'm okay. It's going well!
'Have a look?
Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid.
...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious. His creditors
No. I just went deeper into the machine. Preferred being the geek to having to explain. Lying would've been worse.
...Worse?
Cause he was a liar. And I hated him. "Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world." The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him -- Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one.
That's great! Thanks.
"Dear Lisa. I've enjoyed working with you. I'd be lying if I didn't say I find you attractive. But in my heart I know that Alice..." You left my party to send E-mail?
You could've handwritten it.
I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
Gary, I --
I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because of who you are.
I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software.
This is good. Who did it?
'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.
What'd the girl say?
Hasn't affected his work, though.
Help me change the Skywire settings. Add five degrees to each satellite coordinate.
Gary, don't worry, we --
Okay, #2.
Ready for number three?
Let's go.
Longitude 109 --
Wait... He knows.
What?
'Knows I'm altering the coordinates. Let's jump to #12.
Gary?
All the companies know. The faculties tell 'em. At the target schools.
I think you should go.
You do?
I know you lost all his work. Maybe I could come down here and --
You are naive. Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years. Not that I don't miss you.
Just thought his work should go on.
He was on the verge of something, too. He was gonna show us the next day. He said "The answer's not in the box, it's in the band." Know what it means?
It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up.
Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style.
Your app kind of blew mine out of the water.
We'll come up with the next big thing.
...You wanna work -- here?
You guys'll be using Teddy's old space, is that okay?
Could it be a glitch? Something the construction workers caused?
Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in?
Every entry was authorized.
Keep looking.
What're we looking for?
Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. Without leaving the first time.
Get the backslash, the colon, keys kids don't use but geeks do. What would Milo want in here, anyway?
You calling Phil and Randy?
Come with me.
Now what are we doing? I don't get any of this shit!
Lisa.
You know my name.
You know mine.
You're famous around here.
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
...Were you?
We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
...Something like that. Yeah.
Did I say something?
What've you got there?
Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
Cool!
Did you wanna be alone?
They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going?
"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration. Is it like that with your counselor?
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
You're compulsive.
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
Why's that?
So, when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers. Was that then? Or now?
That's great. I -- didn't know.
I snuck into #21.
Why would you do a thing like --
You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.
It's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. They upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files. They'd be happy just to steal code forever. But when a program gets close to fruition. Like Teddy. He was almost there.
But why would they --?
I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you. I know what he did to you.
Is that my -- scenario? Tell me.
They'd frame him.
He's out of prison?
...Milo?
Hmm?
I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean.
What about the FBI?
They've got this guy in the DOJ, maybe others. We tell the wrong person, it's over.
Who can we trust?
Do we post it on the Net?
The mainstream media. TV, or a newsmagazine.
Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick.
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
He's buying up pretty much everything: cable companies, baby bells, picture libraries, museum rights, film archives... Getting ready for Skywire.
What about "60 Minutes."
Yeah, they dig stuff like this. "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."
But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --
Time?
How close are you?
What?
We can't just assume they're standing by to receive Skywire 12 months from launch. I'd have to write in an aglet.
A what?
It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.
But they'd still get the idea, right?
You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?
It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
Before they kill somebody else, too.
Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions.
You mean -- break in?
I don't know --
Why were you so careless?
Why were you snooping in my office?
'Think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are?
I told Teddy about you.
What'd he say?
I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so much" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into --
Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we're there.
The dishes are juiced up, too.
Thank God.
Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
They know I broke in. Alice helped me. Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.
He doesn't know about the Day Care.
Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?
Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
Oh.
Same with the excerpts I'm choosing: they'll play against any of the images you described.
Perfect. How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to --
You could always say you have to go the bathroom.
That's lame, isn't it?
Does he know you know?
He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do. We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version. But I've gotta go home for an hour.
Why?!
She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't.
Please don't go.
Meet me at the other location.
They know, I had no choice. Get out of the house now! Do you have a laptop?
It's three years old, it --
Bring it to the other location.
Maybe it's the satellite.
...He knows.
What?
Latitude 47 degrees.
...You got my E-mail?
And your phone messages. You wanna do what you do, it's not a crime.
Is that how Larry feels?
Wanted to say goodbye to him...
We rented a loft in Sunnyvale. You know what's the bad part? We can't talk about work anymore. We're competitors! The venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms.
But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week.
They're in the neighborhood. They usually hassle Vietnamese grocers.
Jesus, Teddy.
I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet? Milo?
I met this girl.
What? Come on. Is it serious?
I don't know.
Did you tell Alice?
No! I keep thinking it'll go away. But there's this -- connection. She's been hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot. Plus I see her every day, we're working on the same program. She's -- beautiful.
A beautiful geek? I don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the chances?
What d'you mean?
I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.
What does that mean?
Milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. Most don't have one.
So -- how far are we from the campus?
So how'd you like the house?
His Snapples were in alphabetical order.
Every geek here's got a thing for Lisa. But that's about the biggest reaction she's had to anybody.
She's a programmer?
Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps. You'll be working with her.
I've got a girlfriend, remember?
What're they building?
#21. Way behind schedule. It's top- secret, but everybody knows it's a digital broadcast space. They see the dishes on top, the fiber optics going in.
Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites.
We tried the big vaporware number, Gary, it's no-sale.
Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
Maybe he'll get back to work.
Speaking of which...
Did you download Corey? In San Jose?
Damn. 'Have to go back over there. Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door.
What is it?
Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.
There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual.
That kid's the great white hope.
I could get it out of him.
Who're these guys?
Where is he?
Fellas, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave here now.
Wait a second. I'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place.
You seem surprised to see me.
I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
What, and watch all my earnings go... Down the toilet?
What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta... Please?
You may.
Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills.
Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?
I didn't, baby, you just told me.
It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later. But first, let me slip into something more comfortable.
Come in.
I'd rather talk about Number Two.
May I wash you?
In Japan, men come first and women come second.
Or sometimes not at all.
Care for some saki?
How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?
'Pardon me for being rude, It was not me, it was my food. It just popped up to say hello, and now it's gone back down below.'
That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
'Milk, milk, lemonade. Round the corner fudge is made. Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
To my health.
Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
Is it about my teeth?
Yes.
Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?
I'll tell you all in due time, after we make love. But first, tell me another poem.
I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'
Austin Powers? Hi, I'm Andy Warhol.
Hey, how are you?
Hungry.
I'm going to paint this can of soup and become famous and not give you any credit for it.
If you can become famous, everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame, man.
"Fifteen minutes of fame?" I'm going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that, either.
Hello, Austin. This is Basil Exposition, Chief of British Intelligence. You're Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, and you're with Agent Mrs. Kensington. The year is 1967, and you're talking on a picture phone.
We know all that, Exposition.
I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.
Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good.
Just where you'd never think to look for him. We'll be there.
Good luck, Austin.
Thank you.
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
Be careful.
Where am I?
You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
Yes, I'm having trouble controlling... THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!
You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence.
Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?
A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.
Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades?
We won, Austin.
When do I begin?
Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
You mean Mrs. Kensington?
Vanessa's one of our top agents.
Yes, well...Agent Kensington will get you set up. She's very dedicated. Perhaps, a little too dedicated. She's got a bit of a bug up her ass. Good luck, Austin, the world's depending on you.
Thank you, Exposition.
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
Be careful.
Hello Austin. Hello Vanessa. This is Basil Exposition, from British Intelligence. There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr. Evil. Many of the Virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying. That's the first place you should look. Well, I'm off to the chat rooms.
Thank you, Exposition.
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence. Thank you for confirming the link between Dr. Evil and Virtucon. Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan. I'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately.
Right away, Exposition.
She's working on another lead right now.
Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
Thank you, Basil.
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
Oh, yes. Thank you.
There's one more thing, Austin.
Yes?
Be careful.
Hello, Exposition.
Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.
Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.
What's the other?
Excuse me?
What's the other thing you're scared of?
Carnies.
What?
Circus folk. Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.
Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.
Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle. I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
My God, Austin, what have you done?
I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.
Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
All right, Austin, I think you should go.
I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.
I'm leaving! Oh, and Austin?
Yes, Basil?
Be careful.
Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr. Evil from destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe, and somehow you and Agent Kensington managed to escape unscathed from his evil lair.
I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.
Congratulations, Field Agent Kensington!
Here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. Ring him up, he'll look after you.
But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--
Yes Basil?
Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger.
Hey, Mick!
Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
Well, you can't always get what you want.
"You can't always get what you want!" That's a great title for a song! I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit.
Good on ya, man.
Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000. I'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point. You might as well surrender. Resistance is futile. Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to...
Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.
Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.
Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?
That does not compute.
Why not? It's a question.
What's wrong with your hand?
I'm sorry, baby, I'm just not grocking your head space.
Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?
I've got you, Dr. Evil!
Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties,
No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same. It's freedom, man.
Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.
That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.
It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil.
Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967.
Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.
My mother's told me all about you.
If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me. God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?
OK, OK, man, don't get heavy, I'll sign. Just to get things moving, baby.
Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.
Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?
I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My
That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?
I beg your pardon?
I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.
Excuse me?
My wedding tackle.
I'm sorry?
My meat and two veg.
Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.
Have you ever made love to a Chigro?
A Chigro?
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro... Chigro.
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag! They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.
Sure.
Do I make you horny?
What?
Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.
Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.
You've preserved my Jag! Smashing!
Let me guess. The floss is garotte wire, the toothpaste contains plastic explosives, and the toothbrush is the detonation device.
No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.
Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me! Honestly, this isn't mine.
I'm sure.
I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses.
Here, use mine.
I can't see a bloody thing.
Why did you leave so soon?
Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with?
Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear.
Why?
A limousine has just pulled up.
Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat.
How do you know?
Let's go get him!
He's too well-protected right now.
We can't just sit here, Austin.
Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'
I don't get it.
Well, you know... cows, and shagging.
Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
I hate having my picture taken.
Fancy a nibble?
Watch out, you're on my hair!
Sorry. Move your hand to the left. There you go. Gorgeous.
I haven't had fun like that since college.
I'm sorry.
Why?
Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell.
You're smashed, Vanessa.
I am not.
Oh, yes you are.
I can't. You're drunk.
It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about. What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know.
Really, Austin!
Austin, may I have a word with you?
Of course, luv.
Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but
Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
No, did you use a condom?
Only sailors use condoms, man.
Not in the Nineties.
Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port. Alotta meant nothing to me.
Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.
It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.
Hello, luv.
Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.
Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that one coming.
Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.
Out and about, doing odds and sods.
Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a rancid taste in my mouth. Do you have a piece of gum?
Do you think she's prettier than I?
Who?
You know who.
No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.
Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges.
Thank God, Austin, we made it.
Does that make you horny?
First, I plan to soil myself. Then, I plan to regroup and think about the next move. Any thoughts?
All right, I get it. I have bad teeth. You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.
Not a good time to lose one's head.
Indeed.
That's not the way to get ahead in life.
Yes.
It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
Shut up.
What do we do now?
We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag. You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.
I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
I'll hurry back.
Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl. I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden, I don't know what happened. The whole time I was shagging her-- I mean really shagging her, I mean it was crazy, I was like a huge mechanical piston, in and out, IN and
Austin, what's your point?
Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.
It's not what it looks like, Vanessa. At ease, boys.
Likewise.
I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I...
I believe you, Austin. Let's go.
Follow me! We're going to have to jump over the rail!
Are you crazy?
Austin, I'm coming with you.
I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.
I have something to tell you.
Lay it on me.
I love you, Austin.
That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
Kiss me.
Danger Powers, personal effects.
Actually, my name's Austin Powers.
It says here, name Danger Powers.
Danger's my middle name.
OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.
That's not mine.
One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.
One warranty card for Swedish-made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers.
I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.
Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?
Everything seems to be in order.
Here, have a piece of gum.
Don't mind if I do.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
Noooooooooooooo!
Commander, this is Slater in SoWest Com Three. We have a potential bogey with erratic vectoring and an unorthodox entry angle.
Is it one of ours?
No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite. It does have an odd shape, sir.
What are you saying, son?
Oh my God, he's back.
In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.
Shut up.
Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
Commander, I have to log it...
But my design was perfect! Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left.
But Dr. Evil, all you need to do is-- --work with this tennis ball. Squeeze it for twenty minutes a day. A few months of that and it'll be just as strong as the other arm...
We could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation process&emdash;
Ahhhhhhhhh!
We've got a lot of work to do.
Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.
Ow! You shot me!
Right. Okay. Moving on.
Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever?
Yes.
Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet your son.
My son?
Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions?
Breathtaking, Frau. These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers.
Quite impressive.
Thank you, Herr Doctor.
Release the sharks! All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
Dr. Evil?
Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
What is it now?
Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have?
Sea bass.
Right.
They're mutated sea bass.
Really? Are they ill-tempered?
That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave. Thank you. OK, group, we have two new member. Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr.... Ehville?
No, the boy's right. I really am evil.
Actually, the boy's quite astute. I am trying to kill him. My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive.
We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.
The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
Hi.
Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil. I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son! Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.
But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?
An evil vet?
No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
An evil petting zoo?
Scott my boy, come here. How was your day?
Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I
Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
And that's how you want to live your life, is it?
Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.
Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
In due time.
But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill-tempered sea bass it is. Come, let's return to dinner. Close the tank.
Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.
I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.
Come, everyone, let us repair to the main chamber. Project Vulcan is about to begin. Scott, are you coming?
I don't want to.
Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?
Blow me.
What did you say?
Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!
I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.
I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.
We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors. Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved.
Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did have an affair. He admitted it, and they are now divorced, actually.
Umm, that also has already happened.
Don't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars? A million dollars isn't that much money these days.
Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.
Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?
Great.
How's Austin?
He's asleep.
You didn't...
I'm proud of you.
Why?
Well, God knows he tried, but I've been rather firm with him, Mummy. You didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex. It's bizarre.
You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
What about his teeth?
You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
I just don't see it.
Just wait. Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out.
Did you ever...
Of course not. I was married to your father.
Did you ever want to?
You didn't answer my question, Mum.
No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone.
I'm on with a friend! Look, I'd better go. I love you.
So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?
Well, it's kind of weird.
We don't judge here.
OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
And how do you feel about that?
What do you want to do, Scott?
We don't label people here, Scott.
No, he's really evil.
I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.
We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
Really?
Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?
Normally, we'd be eager to oblige --
Seriously?
Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.
You don't say. How real does it feel?
As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.
There are limits?
The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.
I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand ... ? Blue ...
... bottle ...
Red ...
Knight ...
Black...
... death ...
Love...
Flower ...
Nature ...
... preserve...
Secret ...
... love...
Hope...
... love ...
Fear ...
... love ...
How long have I been here?
He said if it vanished, he'd know it was ... you who betrayed him. He took a huge risk. The ultimate test.
Would that I could say the Same.
I've come to apply for membership in Brolly --
I so agree. How did you acquire a taste for it?
You
Have we met?
Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.
Promised? Who promised?
Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell you everything ... The weather's getting worse and worse ... they're after me ... coming for me ... come quickly!
May I help you, madam ...
Mr. John Steed, please.
I'm afraid that's impossible.
You are female?
As you see.
Then you can't come in.
I have an appointment.
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?
Quite a collection.
Your voice -- it's so familiar ...
Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have been a worthy opponent. You have tracked us down. You are within an ace of winning.
This isn't a game.
Quite right, but we still make the rules.
Rules are made to be broken.
People, too.
Then who wins?
Close. We're so hush-hush, even we know nothing about it. Now let's see, there's coconut cake, date and walnut; I recommend the rum baba ...
Hmmm ...
My number two. Special assignments. She's --
How curious ...
Father will be your controller. Steed here will show you the ropes.
Welcome to mobile H.Q. Weather's turning quite nasty. Sir August was blown to smithereens. Along with half of Banffshire. The Ministry's worried.
Would it be possible to use it for military purposes?
London. The World Council of Ministers meets soon on global defence. If you can control the weather, you control the world.
I resign.
You need treatment, Mrs. Peel. You can't resign.
What are you trying to do to me?
We want to help...!
I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with that.
The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ...
Peter Peel was a first class agent. A senior operative. 'X' department Special operations. He was engaged in top secret research. Top priority. Government approved.
The Institute ... the funding ...
Who?
This is an official matter, Mrs. Peel. No need to take it personally. Where are you going?
To find out who killed my husband.
The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.
About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ...
Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps another macaroon ...
Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.
You.
A slight miscalculation -- my face was burned beyond recognition. Fortunately my research into plastics came in handy ...
Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...
An unholy trinity ...
You killed my husband.
For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...
Too many cooks --
Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...
But I found you. All the clues led me here ...
Of course. I planned that, too.
But -- why?
You disappoint me, Emma. Can't you guess? For you. It was all for you ...
'Our revels now are ended.'
Think of this as your second wedding feast ...
I'm already married ...
You know, I believe she's actually jealous.
Valentine, listen to me ...
Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.
That's better. I say, isn't this where you came in? It's impenetrable, by the way ...
You're mad.
Such as?
Destruction of their local weather systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air.
The result would be ...
Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure. Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...
Then what's stopping you?
The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter; I tried to steal it from you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll be a bit less subtle. With this ring my plan will be complete.
How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.
Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.
What are my choices?
Choices?
Doctor Peel, I presume?
I was about to throw in the towel.
I had a spot of bother at the door.
I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
1922. Why the kippers?
Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?
So what was all this -- some sort of test?
Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor.
Whereas you are.
Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.
Rules are made to be broken.
Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing.
And just what is the game?
I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?
Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.
Much better.
And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?
I didn't. Mother did.
... Showers followed by sunny periods.
Ah ... From Trubshaw's. My shoemaker.
My father always wanted a boy.
Really? I fail to see the connection.
Do you?
I thought we were on our way.
Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man worth meeting. No point setting out half shod.
Steed, we really must be --
You can but I wish you wouldn't ...
That place is so absurd, so out of date ...
You know what I mean. This car -- and you. Nobody walks around like that. Milk?
But why? What's the point?
A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.
And I suppose you're the knight.
The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.
Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?
As per mother's instructions.
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
For a man in my position --
Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking. How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.
I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?
After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea?
No thanks.
According to Mother, Sir August owns half of the Highlands. A millionaire. Former head of Special Projects at the Ministry. Now ...
Not so much eccentric. More barking mad. He has a wife called June. And a daughter somewhere -- Julie.
June, July ... August?
The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.
Any other vices?
So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How?
Ah, Brenda ... Mrs. Peel?
You should be dead. How do you feel?
Strange.
You were very lucky. Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank.
I wasn't about to.
I mean your man Trubshaw. Your bullet-proof waistcoat. I thought you were just overdressed.
Mother and Dr. Darling have me under observation. They think I tried to kill you.
Why should they think that?
You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead.
Frankly that's how I remember it.
But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style.
Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel.
That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
Did he say who?
An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?
I must say, you look more your old self --
You mean my other self ...
Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?
Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry.
Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...
What on earth?
Any ideas?
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
Is that written in his shoe?
Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
For you, Mrs. Peel.
But
Not quite. This is my field.
Is there anything that isn't?
The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...
Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
But if someone miniaturized the process...
That's what we were working on.
Three agents killed by bad weather...
... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret defense establishment. A group of eccentrics obsessed by weather ...
... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything points to you. No sisters? No undiscovered twin?
Not that I know of. Explanation?
Is that what you think?
Do you always drive this fast?
What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing?
Barely.
This must be the last straw.
Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
Steed ... !
Where am I?
The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please forgive me. I thought you were someone else ...
Was I?
I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
You followed me.
Orders.
To kill me?
I could save you the trouble.
No trouble.
Because you always obey orders ...
Yes ... ?
And do you trust me?
I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...
Mmm ... what are you doing?
Keeping a stiff upper lip?
But you did suspect me.
Not for a moment.
You're playing games.
Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
I thought you played by the rules.
I thought you didn't.
I'm playing to win.
Winning isn't everything.
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
No, after you.
You don't trust me?
I told Mother I took care of you.
You lied.
Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who?
No idea who. No idea why ...
Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
Very well. I have a friend who might be of assistance. He's at the Ministry. We'd better be careful.
His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.
Why's he called 'Invisible'?
Aren't you coming?
We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...
Hurry? What for? I'm just now --
There's a reception this evening. Colonel Jones thinks it advisable we attend.
What's that you're wearing?
It's called Black Leather.
What is it?
Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.
You first.
Trubshaw again? What now?
They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel.
Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers?
I'll be back ...
Where are you going?
Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...
You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect.
No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.
But --
Oh, and by the way, I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder.
Mrs. Peel?
What kept you?
'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -'
'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
Still a bit chilly ...
English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ...
Have you any place in mind?
I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed.
It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
Our little paradise -- just made for two?
Our chaperon.
Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby?
Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died.
Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel. With a twist. You're our chief suspect.
Where's Mother?
You don't believe him?
Emma in Wonderland. Welcome, Mrs. Peel. We've been expecting you. We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us. Decontamination is almost complete.
Decontamination -- ?
Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Don't worry about me being invisible. Other than that I'm perfectly normal.
I see.
Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch: Valentine Peel.
Peter's brother? But --
Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... research into robotics and plastics. Overtaken by Peter's work on the physics of climate change ...
I know all this.
Do you also know that during your final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance?
Surveillance? By whom?
Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.
Who's now vanished.
Makes two of us.
I was getting to it.
Getting to what?
The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --
Under the circumstances Mother didn't see fit, but I think I can get you in ...
'X' marks the spot. The shoes were delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park. Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the site of a former Ministry installation...
Privately owned by ...
Let me guess: Wonderland Weather.
Very good, Mrs. Peel ...
I shall need a small plane.
You're not venturing alone, surely.
A series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns ...
Global warming?
We know one thing. That suspect was not Mrs. Peel.
Oh, hello ...
We want Mrs. Peel.
Steed
How did you guess?
You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
Mother betrayed me. She was going to replace me with a younger Father. Errand boy that's all I was. 'Find Steed...'
Mother. I thought you were burglars.
Weather's turning nasty.
You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely.
Your research into climate engineering was state-of-the-art. Your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming -- had they succeeded. We need your expertise.
Think she really killed those agents?
She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.
Amnesia?
Possibly. Split personality ...
Insane ... ?
Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.
Why?
Something went wrong. System malfunction. Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape. Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File still open.
Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry. She was in a dangerous game, Steed. High stakes. She may prove to be a risk. If she is, there's only one solution. Termination.
Anyone particular in mind?
We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late. Someone tipped them off ...
Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb.
This man -- did you see him?
You're accusing Mrs. Peel of killing her own husband?
Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs. Peel. Unfortunately --
Guilty until proven innocent?
I was hoping you could tell me.
You're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. Weather's turning very nasty -- and so am I.
I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.
Where?
In your operation.
Are you alright, young man?
Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy.
I feel sure of it.
I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?
You with Mother or Father?
Both, actually.
Good. Glad to see they're together at last. They don't get along. Promotion. Top job. Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry.
Wonderland Weather Ltd.
Mrs. Peel -- ?
Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
No, please! I beg you ...
Walk over to the window ...
Let it be rain, please let it be --
John Steed.
Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.
The last one you'll ever see.
You're better than I expected.
I was at Harrow ...
Bang-bang ... you're dead.
One shot -- for emergencies.
That's not playing by the rules.
Rules are made to be broken.
If you say so.
You said ... one shot.
Aren't you forgetting about something?
You are, and it's behind you.
I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel?
What's happening?
Debbie's marrying Rick.
Does Cole know about this?
I'm totally blown away. You're getting married. It seems like only yesterday I showed you how to have oral sex.
Look at that guy. What a hunk.
Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited.
Bobbie, what are you talking about?
He still thinks I'm going with him. I'm going to break the news to him tomorrow.
He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party?
They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.
What do you mean?
I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car.
You're kidding.
That's what we're going to find out...
Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.
I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?
Rick's got an important announcement to make.
What?
Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads.
Where's the women, man? We gotta have women.
Chulo, one thing at a time.
I don't get it, but at least Gary's got the real stuff coming up here in a few minutes.
Hey, you guys, what's going on?
We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
I've decided not to run for President.
Man, you're losing your audience.
Yes, gentlemen. Saturday after next, I lose my amateur standing and turn pro.
You sure Gary's got this whole party deal together?
Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.
I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.
All right!
Denmark makes great Nautilus equipment.
And...
Cole. Don't you know it's bad luck to see the groom before the wedding?
I want Debbie.
Cole...
You dump her and I'll give you cash.
What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
Five thousand dollars.
Seventy-five hundred.
Not interested.
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
I'm marrying Debbie.
Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...
Thanks, Dad. Cole, go away.
He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.
Rick, I want to talk to you.
I don't want any trouble.
Oh, come on, just a little.
I'm ready to make you another deal.
Ooh, be still, my heart.
Great car.
The best.
I love that car.
I'll trade you my Porsche for Debbie. An even swap.
The car for Debbie?
I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
Low mileage... Handles like a dream.
Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!
Maybe it had something to do.
Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be.
Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
Cole, what the hell are you doing?
He and Debbie stand outside the theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. Fourteen movie theaters under one roof. Prominent is a sign which reads: "24 HOUR 3D FESTIVAL!" Cole drags Debbie into one of the theaters. The gang runs up to the theaters.
Hello?
Mr. Thomerson.
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
Yes I did.
Fine. How's everything going?
Hi, everybody. Am I late?
So, Cole, you been practicing your game?
Nice shot.
Thank you, sir.
I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
Yes, sir, I am.
Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.
I've tried to change her mind.
It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
But how can I do that?
Thanks for the advise, sir.
So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game. Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me?
Some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise.
Well, tell the asshole to shut up.
Right. Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
Cole, my God, boy, what are you doing here? What happened?
The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down...
Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?
1002.
All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself. You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.
Cole?
Cole, we've got to talk.
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
No, Cole, I...
It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...
You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
You know how that makes me feel, Deb? Wanta know how that makes me feel? Angry, Deb. Yesss, that's the word, angry. But if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. I want you to be happy, Deb. No matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts. Be happy, Deb. Be oh, so very, very happy.
Cole, I'm sorry, I...
That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.
I'm going now, Cole.
God, you're a slob.
But a fabulous cook.
What are we having?
It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.
Don't worry... it's supposed to do this.
Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
You're going to have a bachelor party?
Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event. Well, what do you think?
It looks awful.
Yes, but looks are deceiving... Not in this case, however.
Are you going to have women at your party?
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
Oh, those. Why do you ask?
Huh? Wha...
I can't sleep.
Stop fooling around... I need to talk.
What's the matter?
I don't know... I just feel scared.
About what?
The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
That feels so great.
Good...
Um... that's very relaxing.
Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.
You better not have too much joy.
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow... We're going to the chapel and we're...
This is it, lady. Last stop.
Can't I just go with you guys?
Remember, you promised... no screwing around.
Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
Okay, I promise... I swear on my mother's grave.
Your mother's not dead.
Have a good time. Don't make it too late.
Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
Don't turn on the lights, sugar. I'll lead you around.
How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
I can't trust you!
C'mon, I knew it was you.
Let go of me!
Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
I don't want that. I want to be with you.
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
I don't believe you.
See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?
Yes...
Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
Let's get naked.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
If I were you, I'd worry less about the shower and more about Rick's bachelor party.
Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?
Ilene, Rick promised...
Are you sure this is a good idea?
Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.
That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
Let's go.
Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it!
Ilene, are you crazy?
I'm using the same caterer for the shower I had for our Christmas party last year.
Why is Cole here?
A strange wang right in my palm.
What kind of job? I'm a housewife.
I hope Ilene's all right.
Ed, we're so glad you could come over at the last minute and judge our little beauty pageant.
Congratulations on your daughter's wedding. Who's she marrying?
A real turd.
Great bathing suit.
Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it.
So we want your best girls, the cream of your crop.
Park View Hotel, Room 1002.
They'll be up there in a half hour.
Jumbo, where the hell are the women?
What are you talking about, asshole?
Your whores never showed up.
They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
That's it, prick lips.
What are you...
I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got?
Why?
This is bad public relations. I was planning to do a lot of business with you. But now I'm going to have to go elsewhere.
Give him the works.
Screw you... Screw that... Don't jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for the Police Concert... 1500, not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw you -- Screw Sting. Hi, guys.
Gary, you're quite an animal.
Let's go.
Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement?
Wait a minute. You been living with Debbie! Why do you want to get married?
Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will.
Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.
It's true.
This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
Guy paints a beautiful picture.
I'm going to see what the hell happened.
Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
Hookers beat you up?
Yes.
Gary, how we doing, big stallion?
Rick, I really think I'm in love.
What can I be doing for you?
You're a pimp?
I'm telling you I am, Joe.
I want women.
That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want.
I'll take some.
Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.
I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.
You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.
Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
So, Larry, how have you been?
I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch.
Larry, you and your wife got problems?
Is that all the coke in the place?
That's it.
You want to share it?
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
My marriage is the worst. All crap. A big pile of shit.
Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?
Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
I just want to be alone.
Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.
You okay?
Yeah, I guess so.
Really?
What the hell are you doing?
I'm trying to slash my wrists.
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
I couldn't find any razor blades.
Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.
Ha, ha, ha.
Hi, guys. We brought back a friend.
It's my fault. He's dead because... I left those drugs...
Are any of those right?
This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
It's on the tenth floor.
Keep your voices down. This is a respectable establishment. We don't go for any funny business here. Just then a GUY with a Moosehead Beer hat and TWO GUYS in a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys.
You're all under arrest. Open up!
Oops!
Rick, hit the ball easier, son. You don't have to kill it.
Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience.
Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
I'd love that.
Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
Mr. Thomerson, I...
Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...
Feel free.
Welcome, welcome, one and all.
Rick!
The end.
Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...
Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.
Girls, why don't we go inside for lunch. Boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade?
The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.
Ed... you're kinky!
The phone made me do it!
You've been having strange sex...!
No, Brett, I...
How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...?
Klupner. Mrs. Klupner.
Mrs.?
I'm separated.
I'm getting one heck of a glare off your dress there. Could you undo a few buttons?
Where'd she go?
Where the hell is he?
What's the matter?
We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos Without Pants"...
Olivier's in that, right?
Excuse me, but this is as arousing as a stroll through the Vatican.
Don't you love it when old friends stop by?
Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody.
I'm not really hungry.
What the hell is that?
My gift to you.
Under the table!
I think you'll enjoy this table.
I don't get it. Why didn't you go for it just now?
Rick, I'm concerned.
About what?
This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.
Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.
Oooooo.
Right in there, pal.
If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
How'd it go?
Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
Who was that?
I don't know.
What's this?
How 'bout this?
He look familiar?
Very.
Now, don't get into any trouble.
Hey, you guys...
How about this, a Trojan donkey.
What are you going to do about it?
What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.
Reach out and snort someone.
Guess who's here? Another surprise guest.
Who?
Debbie.
My Debbie?
I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.
You always were sneaky, Stan, very sneaky.
Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.
True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.
That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.
Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's give him a break.
Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next.
Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little. By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.
Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.
You're late again, Rick.
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
There can be no excuse for tardiness.
Sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? If you do, why don't you give me a call. I'm in the book.
Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is.
How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
I don't know.
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
Maybe I did... I don't remember.
Can you believe how perfect it fits?
Oh these moments do try me...
Wash it to the windows?
No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.
That's Franny. She likes firemen.
Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off! You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt. for life?
You know Knowlton pretty well?
Yeah...
Biggest in two battalions.
Adcox, go with Pengelly and check the other side.
It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin' us up. Not with this one.
-- What the hell's the matter with you? You always check the other side. I haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? We got a job here.
Let me take the lead, Stephen...
Aw man, Stephen, listen to me...
-- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.
-- Knock it off!
...What do you want me to do, Stephen? Talk to me. What am I supposed to do?
You stupid son of a bitch! What the fuck are you doing!
Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the clincher. You did okay.
My Lt. might have something to say about that.
Ah, everybody screws up some, Brian. You're working for the toughest Lt. on the job. Saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him into a burning building. It's just bad luck you're family.
Is he...
Did you do it for Tim?
You gotta let me finish --
Just come down, John. Just --
-- He killed people --
-- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --
-- Stephen, this is bullshit --
It doesn't go like that.
Who asked you?
Well, look what we have here. Nice costume. Rent it?
I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.
Doesn't work on you. See ya around, little brother.
Not likely.
I like what you've done with the place.
Been ripping off fire stations?
My God, an actual operating 8-track.
What, you've never seen one before?
In the Field Museum once.
It works.
People actually used to pay you for this?
Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
Sheep don't count.
Yeah? What about Laura --
Why'd you come here, Brian?
I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother "you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed" games?
What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.
Hey! You don't know me --
I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?
So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?
There's only so much technology can do. Thanks for the beer.
Y'know, I told myself a million times I didn't want to be a fireman. I said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy. I know I split, and I know how you felt...
Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
Ya love it, probie?
I'm in heaven, Lt.
Y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. I told you to stay beside me.
-- C'mon, Stephen.
Goddamn it Stephen!
-- I told you to stay next to me!
-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!
C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...
Thanks.
Hey.
So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what?
Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I can get on the cover of LIFE magazine, too.
Jesus, it's too damn bright in here... Like a goddamn spotlight... I'm goin' blind...
This?
Roll the hose.
What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time.
You got a problem with drilling, probie?
No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.
Ready?
Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
You okay?
I waited... I would have fucking waited...
That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game.
Thanks for the insight.
Brian, look --
...Not now, Brian.
Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen?
I had that fire. He didn't listen!
He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen. You burned him.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Just... Just wanted to say hello...
Well, long as you're here you can help clean up a little. I've got a guy coming to look at this in a few minutes.
You're selling dad's boat?
Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of them...
I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do.
Yeah? What have you got to do? Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay.
Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --
It's okay, Stephen, I --
I saw it.
Saw what?
When dad died, I saw another fire...
Everybody did.
I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.
...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?
I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...
Maybe I do. ...What a fuckin' mess, huh? People can change Brian.
Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?
-- Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta talk to you. It's Adcox, he's --
-- What are you doing here?
I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people!
I know.
How do you know?
I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me.
-- What were they doing there?
Anything else?
What are we going to do about this?
I'll handle it.
We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
You're his Lt., Stephen... Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?
You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't you stay behind a desk where you belong?
"You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"
Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't let 'em...
Brian.
Jennifer.
You're back.
You look great.
Thanks for calling.
Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today.
Huh.
So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.
Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.
Yeah? What have you been up to?
I work for city hall.
Really? No kidding.
Well, if nothing else, it's nice to know we can still be friends.
With grenadine, right?
When I was twenty.
Look, I'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a Saturday night. This isn't about fun. I'm working here.
Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.
Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?
Why do you think Marty came here tonight? Because he cares about your department. You don't know how hard he works. You don't know about his programs helping West Side --
-- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.
What was that? Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard.
Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.
Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.
C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.
So now you suddenly care about my future?
Look, I didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, I just thought you'd call when you came back. You didn't and... Don't blow it just because of this garbage between us.
I've been thinking about what you said the other night... If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it.
...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain. Marty's a good man, Brian.
Arson.
Hey.
How's it going?
Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.
Green committed to a thousand. There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.
I could use a date.
Hi.
Hey... So are you dating your boss or what?
If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed. Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
Sorry. Are you dating anyone?
You think that's really any of your business?
Well, you did invite me here.
Okay.
Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?
No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.
Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.
Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked.
But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.
Thanks for the invite.
Got anything to drink in there?
This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city. Lotta tradition locked up in here. What do you think?
Homey.
See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?
Do you miss it? You seem like you do.
When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.
Then why did you quit?
Well, our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment. This area is the pumping panel, which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose.
Brian. What's wrong?
You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --
-- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --
Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --
-- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.
I was doing my job.
Yeah? And just how much of all this has been "doing your job"?
Let me ask you something, do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills? Who the hell are you kidding? I was there, remember? I saw you and your brother --
Leave Stephen out of this --
Oh yeah, he's the real fireman. Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --
-- I work for the city.
Hi.
Hi.
We still talking? Look, I'm sorry about the other day --
Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden.
I don't know anything about it.
You could check. It'd be in his files.
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
Yes.
Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
What is --
I'm sorry.
That's a dumb thing to say.
I think your boss is going to need some spin control.
I quit two days ago, Brian.
What'll you do?
I don't have the slightest idea...
I'll see ya around, huh?
Brian McCaffrey... Oh this is really a treat. Brian McCaffrey. Lost a dad to the animal, huh?
I'm close... but I can't get who it is...
Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair?
Who's doing this?
Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?
Then who --
-- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.
I don't have a story.
Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there?
What?
You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard --
I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.
Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian? C'mon, you promised. Be honest. Okay... Guard!
-- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything...
Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.
The outlets.
That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
Trychticholorate.
Who the fuck is doing this?
Oh Jesus Christ...
If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing.
You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?
I want another shot, Sir.
Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back?
If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --
-- I don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot.
I need another one, sir.
Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.
No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.
Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.
Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant.
Are you still here?
Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.
Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.
Where are you going?
-- Shhh.
So you were happy here. Warm and cozy and in no hurry... Soot high, clean unburned wall low, indicates slow burn in thermal balance. Find me some glass.
Glass?
Glass found in ignition room is in small, thin pieces, indicating explosion. Lack of discoloration indicates a long, slow burn. Explosion must of come after a slow burn. You little tease... What were you up to you little bastard, huh? What made you that mad? Or scared. It started in this room. Took its time, hung out... but the air ran out. It couldn't
Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire.
Uh, I don't think that's in my contract...
Read.
"Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --"
-- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.
"During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium".
Son of a bitch tears 'em apart just to eat the oxygen. Wouldn't take much at all to melt ten gauge wire. Problem's burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace -- unless you could find something that would eat its residue.
Look, it isn't proof, okay? Someone may have put the chemical in the outlet, but we found it as a vapor in Cosgrove's clothes.
And the putty around the door?
Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier
But the right guess on this is arson.
I don't guess.
Some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case.
That's it! Oh, that son of a bitch, he's different, goddamn it! You see what this tells us, huh? Our killer doesn't love fire!
What?
I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts.
But he killed these guys.
But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.
What reason?
Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out.
That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience?
No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point.
Are you going public with this?
What the hell are you doing here?
In a word, Brian, what is this job all about?
Hey boss, Dekom Trust is owned by Pan Illinois... which is majority controlled by Lakeside Dynamics... which is a division of Windy City Ventures... who's partners are... Alan Seagrave, Donald Cosgrove, and Jeffrey Holcomb.
So Seagrave and Holcomb were accountants...
And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate. They weren't very high on Seagrave, either.
Nice bunch of guys.
This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight.
I've got three different drafts of the same report -- with different numbers that're all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along.
Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.
Then who wrote the report?
Well Brian, I guess you can say it's arson now...
Did you pull me out?
Yeah.
Did I say thanks?
No.
Just wondering.
So what do you want me to do?
Your brother was a good man.
Yeah.
Another couple of good men get burned up for their city? Is that how it's going to read? You're the only one that knows.
Brian?
Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.
'Bout written you off. How long have you been in town?
Four months.
Four months?
That's Sean? Jeez, he's a giant.
Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.
Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?
Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
Yeah. Big fan.
And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian.
Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.
No need to be modest, Brian.
No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
-- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
Every little boy's fantasy.
Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
I have a job.
This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.
Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.
Mr. McCaffrey...
Nice boat.
Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?
Completely out of control.
Aren't you even curious?
Engine 115, right?
How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.
Lucky guess. And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.
You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115?
Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy. 115's the station.
Man. Something sure put a crimp in his evening.
Do you have to do that?
Y'know what Stephen said to me, right when all the shit was coming hard? "You never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you're just gonna do this job or be great at it".
What?
So, you surviving without me?
There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.
Well, if it isn't the littlest McCaffrey. Hey! You break anything with that you buy it! Sorry, there must be something wrong with my eyes. I keep thinking that's a fire department uniform.
Really. Well, let's have a look at what else was "in your blood". I always look forward to getting these, they make such a nice collage for the bar... "Assistant Director, Sales, Aspen Snowmobile Tours..."
Didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge I need.
Uh huh. And "Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins". That was in your blood about six months wasn't it?
Management were pin heads.
"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?
Coffee sucked.
And just this year, "Brian's Sound Spectrum". Your own company even. Big step.
I was ahead of my time.
Who's going to die?
Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right.
Your brother's right. If you don't fasten these correctly they could open and you'd get burned.
Fireman shit?
Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd you grow up, a barn?
Firehouse.
Dad!
I hate it when we gotta fucking go look for it.
Stevie? Rimgale's here to see you.
I'm busy.
He just wants to --
We gotta roll, Stevie...
I'll be there.
They're waitin' man.
Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a second about Sean...
You can't talk about my brother like that...
Stephen, what are you doing here?
Fixing my roof.
Where's Sean?
He's got piano lessons.
Oh yeah? How's he doing?
He's going to be a fireman.
Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...
Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since I don't remember much of it --
-- You remember.
Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something.
The great communicator.
Sorry I hit Jackson.
He deserved it. He was born deserving it.
He treats you okay?
Okay.
I treated you better.
You want some coffee?
Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.
What's wrong, Stephen? C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind. How's Brian doing?
He's out.
I know he's out, but how's he doing?
Y'know, I treated him better than any other probie I ever had. He probably hates my guts, but I did the best thing for him. I made him finally look in the mirror.
Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right.
Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
Yeah? When was the last time?
In a fire? Never. Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
I'm sorry... I... couldn't sleep...
What's wrong?
Cook and I are almost finished here. Have a seat.
Look, I'm sorry I --
-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...
-- He's gettin' good on those eggs. And y'know, he told me he actually likes the piano.
They ran the residue you scraped from both crispers' front doors. It's a combination of plumber's putty and rayophene gum. Burns almost completely away when you light it.
Putty? On both doors?
Anyway, down here, take a look...
See that patch of shirt? We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here had ever heard of it.
Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.
Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire.
What the hell was it doing in the fire?
Shadow.
How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable?
Didn't think you'd make it.
Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal.
Who's this?
He works for me.
Is he a fireman? I like firemen.
You don't know him.
Knock it off. Now.
Tell him about me, Shadow?
Ronald here likes telephones. Used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton. Came up with a whole little thing there, didn't you Ronald? When you got bored, what did you do? You just started making calls... mostly day care centers and retirement homes, wasn't it?
Did he tell you how we finally met?
Nobody cares, Ronald.
Sure Ronald? You're ready alright.
-- Burn them.
And old ladies?
-- Burn them.
And the world -- the whole world.
Got a cause?
Are the glory boys actually showing interest in Investigation's work? I may have a stroke.
I'm working on it.
I deal with this stuff every day. But a fireman... you never get used to it. What happened up there? He was a candidate. Did he pay attention? Was he listening?
...He wasn't listening to the right thing...
What do you listen to, Stephen?
You don't know... nobody knows...
It knows us. This one knows us.
Alderman Swayzak.
Investigator Rimgale.
Inspector.
When are you going to catch the prick that's doing this, Don?
"Don?"
Don't you have any leads at all?
We still haven't found a connection between the victims.
Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise!
Is there a connection between them, Alderman?
Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'?
I'm a little busy right now --
I'm gonna need some bread, man. This ain't fair. I'm always here for you, and you can't even take decent care of me. My landlord is bitching like a motherfucker! You're two months behind on the rent, Lieutenant!
Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man!
Brown Downtown... There hasn't been any smoking brown on the street in --
I can't get over what those guys did to her. I just can't.
They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit
Susie's not a virgin anymore.
It's horrible. They burned her breasts with cigarettes. Christ.
The Church is a fucking racket. I know how they operate. I've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was crying all the way through. Yeah, I know their game inside out. Now I'm free of it and I'm gonna stay that way.
I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God?
What's to believe?
People.
You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
Yeah.
It's not the drugs, Ariane, it's -- it's someone who wants to kill me. You gotta believe me!
Christ! Shit! I could kill them all with my bare hands.
Who?
C'mere. You got some good blow, right?
Yeah.
First I'll put your Uptown in the spoon, then, to make it more exciting, I'm gonna add some Downtown. They call this thing a speedball, honey, but then you must know that... First time shooting up?
Nah...
Can you believe the nerve of this fucking guy? He kills people for fun, and then, he puts up 100 G to bring in some guys who raped a nun. What a sick fuck. Man...
Who?
But you could do it, baby. We could use the bread...
I got it, man! I will find those kids. And I'll get the 50 G from the Church! Then the kids'll go to jail. I'll be in charge, of course. After a little while, I'll break the fuckers out -- and I'll turn them in to shithead I was just talking to. And pick up his 100 G. No. I'll hit him up for
"The Strawberries"?
How come all those guys who're looking to get 50 from the Church haven't come up with shit? You got some kinda inside track?
You took the chalice.
Yes.
You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again.
Are you all right, honey?
So what are you doing here?
He wants to know who brought in the chalice.
That stuff'll kill you quick, man.
What the fuck are you? A drug counselor or a drug dealer? And you don't even do your own product! What kind of businessman are you?
The rich kind. Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide.
How are you doing, man?
There. Now you've got your profit and more. You'll have more product day after tomorrow, right?
Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
I forgive you.
Me?
I forgive you.
You can't forgive me. After what I've done. I've fucked up bigtime. I've been bad. Real bad.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me! Please! Help me! Hate me! Help me! Hate me!
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to be good. Forgive me. Father, for I have sinned. It's still goddamn good to be good.
Large?
All right, cop. I want my money.
It's still my money. If you want to have a chance at any part of it, shithead, you will take my $120,000 and bet on tomorrow's game.
What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?
Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet.
Let me think about it.
Oh, really?
Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole, man. I'm a fucking cop!
Here's the deal: You meet me tonight across from the Garden. 33rd & 8th. At the beginning of the Ninth Inning. We'll listen to the end of the game together. You bring your cash, I'll bring mine.
I got them all going for Oakland. With bullshit money. We'll cover the $800.
All right. What are you gonna do?
I want 15 on the Mets.
Hey, man. Don't give me that bullshit. Don't pussy-out on me. The Mets are a fucking lock. I wanna make some money.
Are you sure?
OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do?
I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?
I'm not gonna let that bastard take my money
Take your money? This guy will blow up your house and everyone in it!
Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna end up owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac!
Do you have the money?
What money?
I don't got it. Not tonight. You can't get blood from a stone.
This psycho can.
Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.
You're a fucking joke, you know that? He's been waiting for the money since the fucking game ended. And I've been waiting here since -- forget it. Listen up. You're gonna get us both fucking killed. You know that!
You do know that he's gonna blow up your house, kill your wife and kids --
Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and --
He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?
How's the case going?
What case?
The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?
Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.
Get this, man. I was at the game today. Face to fucking face with Strawberry! Jesus! I saw him strikeout. And you know what? He looked at me, and I looked at him, and he laughed and I laughed and it was like we were all alone in that whole stadium and only we understood that it was all a racket, that he struck
-- that there was never any other way it could have gone. Never any other way. So you had better just put in my fucking bet. $120,000 on the last game. The Big One. Come on! Are you a bookmaker, or fucking what?
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned. It has been two days since my last confession. Father, my sin is a terrible sin. A sin of omission. There was another sin that happened at the same time, and in the same place, but my sin I think was graver stil.
Father, if it was so trivial, so natural, so -- No. I have sinned. And you must listen if you are to prescribe an appropriate act of contrition, and to absolve me. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your arms to serve God?
It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt.
I also thought of that bread, Father. And of that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died, and I kept the cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve God?
I think of running for help, and falling to my knees in prayer.
As I have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning -- and my sin. You see, Father --
Yes, Sister?
Those boys, those sad, raging boys... They came to me as the needy do. And like many of the needy, they were rude. Like all the needy, they took. And like all the needy, they needed. Father. I knew them; They learn in our school. And play in our schoolyard. And they are good boys.
Yo, Big Black, we needs a name for this joint.
BLAK OUT. BLAK LISTED. BLAK BALL. Need I say more.
Keep trying.
...Benedict Arnold...
Same thing, y'knowwhatI'msayin', y'knowwhatI'msayin'!
We know. We know. Yo, check it, my black brothers, we can't let this slide. Not this injustice. Nah, no way. Dem' two real coons iz ill.
He gots to be did.
You truly are a dancing fool.
Everybody say Ho!
Ho!
My name is Honeycutt and I want to try something different. Can you do this for me?
Yeah!
C'mon. It's easy. It's the same thing y'all do out at the Yankee game, no different 'cept we changing one word. Everybody go it?
YEAH!
Alright. Here we go. Let's go NIGGERS! LET'S GO NIGGERS!
Let's go niggers!
You idiot. You almost gave me a massive coronary.
I didn't mean to scare you like that.
Well you did.
Give me some?
I'm not huggin' you in the middle of the street. You must be crazy, Julius.
Whoa, hold up li'l sis'. I done told you 'bout that. Julius ain't my name, you better recognize Hopkins was our slave name. My true name is...
I'm not callin you Big Black Africa. Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.
Damn, Sis, you don't keep no food up in here in dis' piece.
My group we need some exposure. Was wondering if you could hook a brother up?
Hook you up? The Mau-Mau's? You must be smoking. Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?
So now I see where you're coming from. Just because we ain't rapping about Gucci, Timberland, Rolex, Benz, Cristal, ho's and bitches, we're pseudo.
Who are you revolting against?
We're revolting against the powers that be, that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color. And we won't stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the government of the U.S. of A.
Please.
If you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours. What's his name again?
Delacroix.
Yeah, him.
What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
You don't have the demographics.
So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting? I'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.
That'swhatI'msayin'. I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else.
There is a name, a term for your kind, the likes of you. Back in slavery days, you would be classified as a house nigga.
If you think I'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative. You got your ways to affect change, I have mine. And I would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house.
My own sister throwin' me out. I hope to seeya later when you get ya mind right. Don't bother letting me out.
The Mau-Mau's are up in dis place. That's right, the Mau-Mau's.
What's your name?
My righteous name is BIG BLACK.
And what are the Mau-Mau's going to do for us today?
We're ready when you are.
Our first caller is Big Black from Brooklyn. Go 'head.
And Big Black from Brooklyn, what do you do?
What do I do?
What do you do?
And another thing, you better stay away from my sister or you better...
Life is beginning to look up. It's all good in da neighborhood.
You might be right.
I'm not smiling.
Naw, not you. It can't be. That hottie Sloan Hopkins.
It's that bad, huh? It's all over my face.
No shame in ya game. She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit.
Certified ladies' man, huh?
What's that?
Moorish. Ya get a little taste of dat booty, ya wanna get some MORE.
Seconds and thirds, too.
Sloan is all 'dat. I try her. I'm a tri-sexual.
You'd try anything. I got first dibs. You get ya own stuff.
DeLa - what's the matter with you.
What's wrong with him?
Please, have a seat.
Sloan never told us she had friends like you.
Why they gotta make my nose so big?
I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
What are you talkin' about?
Jim Jones, y'know. I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
Meaning?
I'm out.
Good. I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.
So that's what you been doing?
Damn skippy.
You're in this up till ya neck.
Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.
You can walk away. We both can.
Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent.
Good morning, Cheeba.
Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
De-la-croix.
Sloan and I have been looking all over for you.
You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
No offense.
I have this concept for a TV pilot. There's no guarantee it will get made but regardless, you'll still make some money.
How much?
What kind of show is this gonna be?
What about in the mean time? Not the in between time?
Nice to meet you.
Gentlemen, the show, our show will be satirical. You know what that is, don't you? Trust me on this one.
We might need some mo' money behind this.
I'm starvin' like Marvin.
My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.
Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.
Ahh, the luxuries of life.
Yo, check it. This is good and all that but one day soon I want to have much Benjamins so I can have a nice crib and pay all my bills. You hear me.
Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit.
And I'm the feet.
Yo, you gotta show some patience. You want me to snap my fingers and presto chango - you're an overnight sensation. Son, there is no such thing.
We ran out without my shoes and the floor. I gotta get my stuff. What about our savings?
We got evicted from our home. We've both been on the streets for the last week.
We was coming to see you.
If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
That ain't funny.
Manray, Sloan says you're too talented to be dancing on the street.
My tap shoes.
What do I have to do?
Some tap dancing, some singing.
How different?
Trust me. Of course I still have to pitch it to my boss, but we'll have an answer one way or the other.
DeLa, I'm aboard. As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!!
I would like to change your name.
To what?
You're now Mantan.
I want you to start using the name Mantan and not Manray if you don't mind.
Why?
Mantan?
I'm not playin' myself no mo'.
How you sound?
I won't do it anymore.
Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan. Believe me, it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her, just lookin' out for a brother. I feel you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work. You gotta be professional.
I'm always gonna be that. But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
Our guest today is Pierre Delacroix. He is the creator of the highly controversial TV show MANTAN. Let's get right into it. You have been called by some in the community a traitor, a sellout, an Uncle Tom. Why does your show generate such feelings?
Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad. No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.
No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?
Yes. And I say yes because who is to judge? Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not? Who? Who can play God?
But the line has to be drawn.
Don't you people get it? We're in the 21st Century. Slavery was over four hundred years ago. All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over. Folks always crying, white man this, white man that. Let's all grow up.
Are you trying to excuse our Holocaust?
...exactly thirty-two minutes ago.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
Four minutes ago.
So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
Do you know what C.P. Time is?
I'm sorry about my blowup but I have to have a whipping boy every meeting.
I understand. But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
I understand Black culture. I grew up around black people all my life. If the truth be told I probably know "niggers" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix. Please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word. I got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word. I don't give a damn
I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.
The material you've been creating is too white bread. White people with black faces. The Huxtable's, Cosby, revolutionary. But that's dead. We can't go down that road again.
I don't agree. The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.
The middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave. The middle class black family moves into a small Southern town that is run by the KKK. The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter. The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter. The middle class single black mother raises her teenage son. And so on and so forth.
Delacroix, wake up, brother man. The reason why they didn't get picked up was because nobody - and I mean NOBODY - niggers and crackers alike wants to see that junk.
I've never been given a fair shot.
You got your head stuck up your ass with your Harvard education and your pretentious ways. Brother man, I'm blacker than you. I'm keepin' it real and you're frontin', trying to be white.
I'm an oreo, a sell out? Because I don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM OUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as you might put it, some "nigger" show? I'm a Tom? I'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black? Is that what you think?
That's exactly what I think. I want you to create something that people want to see. Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans. You know and I know "niggers" set the trend, set the styles. This is a golden opportunity now. These idiots have to be led to the
I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.
What is it you want from me? Some plantation follies? Some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch? Some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads? You want me to go back to the ante bellum days?
Delacroix, I'm glad you got your mind right.
We're all happy to be here and I'm going to paint a picture for you.
I'm wid it.
I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right. In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial. I have never really dug deep. Not anymore. As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way. Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder. If we are ever to live side
Go on. Good so far.
Word!!!
So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium.
The name of the show?
It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
I'm feelin' dis'!
It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air. In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial.
Don't worry about that, that's my department. Now who do we cast? We need a star. Can Whoopi sing or dance?
I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
That's a great handle.
Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat. Two real coons. I know we're way out there but it's satire.
Every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons - Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat. The Dusky Duo.
What are there character traits?
Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
Exactly!
Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.
And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
Yep, you guessed it.
Protest finally forced "Amos and Andy" off the air. Could stop us from ever getting on.
Negroes would be in an uproar.
So what. We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that. No such thing as bad publicity. So what. Earlier you said singing and dancing.
Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer. He has educated feet.
Who are the other characters?
We gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY on dis' one. What's the setting?
In the projects. Like Eddie Murphy's "The PJ's."
And every week these Alabama porch monkeys will make us cry, make us laugh, make us look at our own humanity. Make us feel good to be alive.
I don't know about that plantation angle.
That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout! He's off the hiz-hook!
We think so.
I strongly feel that a Negro should direct this. This kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm. One misstep and we're doing "Amos and Andy." Only a Negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain.
I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.
I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.
You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
I just want you to meet him. Keep an open mind.
Besides, what does he know about Negroes?
Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective. A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter? With this kid, the possibilities are endless.
What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?
If Spielburg can direct "The Color Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot.
That's exactly my point. Has he even directed actors before in anything?
In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!!
I'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone.
I will not be held responsible for these revisions. These changes are not the way I want to go. This is an outrage. This is a sham. A violation!
I don't give a good goddamn about Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from.
We just punched it up a bit. Made it funnier.
Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address. Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.
Yo, DeLa, I just got the news from the CNS brass. They saw some clips from the pilot and they're rushing it onto the air. Yo, we're a midseason replacement, ordered 12 shows. We're on in 3 weeks. Didya hear what I just said, Yo?
They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.
This has to be a big mistake.
The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier. From the gitgo, from jump street.
Hold on a sec, I got a call.
Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
I gots to go, it's my Moms.
What do you want?
I want to speak with you.
Go away, unless you got my money.
Son. Good to seeya. Good to seeya.
It's been a long time.
Pull up a chair. Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT.
Good woman. I trained her right.
Daddy, she's younger than me.
Purely for medicinal purposes.
I did. I'm not an alcoholic. I just like to drink.
How did you end up here?
That's what I'm askin'.
Because I had too much pride. Too much integrity. I wouldn't lick nobody's butt. Some material I refused to do.
That's the only reason, period. They only want one certain kind of black comic.
Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
Enough about me, what's happening with you?
Dem white boys giving you a hard time?
Nuthin' I can't handle.
The truth is never let them seeya sweat. You do that, that's half the battle.
Where do you go from here?
Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.
I didn't mean that, in life.
Let's get him over to the bed.
I love you too, Daddy.
Glad to meet you, too. You are all your father talks about.
How long has my father been like this?
Not that often. He was excited to see you.
So he drank himself into a stuper?
The drinking is for the pain. It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
So what's up with you?
Don't tell him it's from me or he won't take it.
He never showed it.
How was it?
Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?
Nobody told me anything.
What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
Manray!
How did you know?
It hit me like a ton of bricks.
How can this be? You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary.
Manray was under our nose the whole time.
Do you know how you will use him?
You lost me.
Dunwitty wants a Coon show. And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air. Hence I'll prove my point.
What point is that?
The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons.
Sounds risky to me.
You getting cold feet?
I'm in till the end.
Good. I'm going to need your support.
Can't you just quit? Walk away?
Maybe something happened to them. Maybe they're lying in an alley bleed to death.
Hello.
You okay?
What is your problem?
My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?
It was the principle. Dunwitty had to be enlightened. I was making a point. I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money.
Even if money wasn't an issue, Dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous.
What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?
I wouldn't bet against it. My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.
Good morning, for those of you who don't know me, I'm Pierre Delacroix. I'm running things and this here is my assistant Sloan Hopkins.
Hello.
This is the group I was telling you about.
Which one is your brother?
You've said that already.
Just want to say good luck.
Your life will never be the same.
Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.
We both lied to him.
What do you want me to say?
Same here.
I want to apologize about my brother and the Mau-Mau's. I should not have imposed them on you.
Who's side are you on?
What would their reaction be? I hadn't the foggiest.
So you have your small victory, now what?
What is this?
A gift.
For what?
The Jolly Nigger Bank.
This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
Thanks.
I thought it was appropiate.
Is that good or bad?
It's all good. You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank. Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
How so?
Why'd you do that?
I don't want to hear it.
How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
He's just playing big brother.
Oh, is he? You getting jiggy with Mantan?
Please don't go there.
Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
I can't lie to him. If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.
DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.
Light?
That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light. This bucket of blood.
This is crazy.
That was a mistake, but I don't regret it.
The first and only time. A big mistake. I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.
Otherwise. I trust you know the difference. You're an intelligent woman, finished at NYU.
DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
Don't make me have to use this.
I told you but you wouldn't listen. You never listened to me.
Yes, your name?
He, I'm Mona.
Hi, Mona.
I perfectly understand where you're coming from. As a minority I can relate to your struggle also. But I think you should give us all a chance. We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
This thing was rigged, the deck was stacked, the fix was in. Could Don King be near? Good thing Sloan had my back. She's my rock. This was going to be a whole lot of work.
David, I appreciate your comments. Anybody got an ideas? Everybody just talk out loud.
I'm happy for all of us. It's just we have a great responsibility now. The pressure is on.
Pressure? DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!! This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.
That's the way it came out. Let me ask you one question. Have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life?
Now I'm privileged?! Why? Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare? Because I didn't call home a cardboard box? No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too. Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.
Can I kiss you too?
Naw. I'll take the zero.
You feel good, not nervous?
I feel fine.
Not nervous? Relaxed?
So they can be on TV.
You sound like the media.
This is nothing. It will blow over by tomorrow.
Same thing Giuliani said.
No joke. Serious.
Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me. That's some big shoes to fill.
What are you? A man or a mouse? Are you a punk? Punking out on me?
No.
You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
You've made it from the guttermost to the uppermost. Don't you know you should never let them see you sweat. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?
Yeah.
You shouldn't even be mad at me over Sloan.
What you did is dead wrong.
Oh, is it? Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.
Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place? I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity.
I don't believe it.
Mantan, we got a show to tape.
My name is Manray, goddamnit.
You must think I'm some kind of fool.
It looks delicious.
You hear me talkin' to you. The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.
How's the food?
Can't beat it with a hammer. Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.
It was. It is. But this is a different kind of show.
If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
Mommy, please don't call me that.
Son, Peerless is your name. Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate.
I know what's on my birth certificate. You heard from Daddy?
I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this? Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?
To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.
Peerless, your father called.
He wants you to come and see him.
He said that?
Yes he did.
Where is he?
He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
Richmond is not all the way down south.
I don't even know why you're still concerned over him. Daddy's not with you.
Regardless, he still is your father.
It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
Even more reason to see him. He'll be overjoyed with your success.
C'mon, Mommy. Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done. From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.
I'm doing okay. Been reading about your show, it's all over everywhere. I watched it's all over everywhere. I watched it once. I thought you said there would be no buffoonery.
You going to attack me too. The show is a hit. Aren't you happy for me?
Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.
Yes I have, very hard. Has Daddy called?
No.
Not at all?
You know how your Daddy is.
If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan.
I won't forget. When are you coming up here to see your mother?
Nice to meet you. If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you?
Where are you from?
Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland.
Finland.
You know, Finlandia vodka? Yes?
Yes, I know. Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before? Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
A fiasco. A disaster. A boondoggle. An abomination.
Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!
Ahhh!!! I never heard of that term before. I thought you were BLACK of African-American. No?
Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were NEGROES. I'M A NEGRO.
How did you get this gig?
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
This is a TV show, not a music video.
Then will you teach me what I need to know. Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
Good luck, Jukka. Do a good show.
I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings. Through the roof. But in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead. I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz.
Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy.
The Mantan Manifesto. Catchy ain't it? Number One. We gainfully employ African Americans, in front of and behind the cameras. Two. Let the audience decide. Three. Who put these critics in charge? These so-called cultural police? Four. Who determines what is black? Five. Mantan is a satire. Six. If they can't take a joke, "F" 'em.
Let Myrna finish.
Yes you!
I never had a really real pair before.
You've never had any formal training, either?
Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.
I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while.
You sing and dance?
A little. I just graduated from NYU film school. Cinema studies.
So what's up with you and DeLa?
What do you mean?
No, we're not knocking boots. I got this internship while I still was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant.
I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with. You look beautiful like that.
If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.
You're welcome. You shouldn't give up on performing.
Why do you say that? You've never seen me.
I think that would probably make you the happiest. When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
Our guest tonight is the extraordinary, talented performer, Mantan. Thanks for coming in.
Tavis, thank you for having me.
Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview. You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here.
I'm more comfortable around my people.
Let's jump right into it. Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue. How do you see all of this?
Money and nothing else?
Money makes the world go round. It ain't no joke being poor. I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'? I've lived on the street. I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game.
Is it inevitable that the game plays you?
No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand. Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing. If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it. Or better yet write your own show. Do it better.
Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple. Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL. It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem. This is America. Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else. I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same
This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat.
We both left the hustle and bustle of Uptown, Harlem...
...the big apple, New York, New York.
To come back to our roots.
Our Alabamy Home. Now we're getting countrified. We is Bama's.
No mo' "city slickers." Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.
Cousins, I want all of you to go to your windows. Go to your windows and yell. Yell, I'm tired of the drugs, the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents. I'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks. I'm tired, you're tired, we're all tired
You tellin' the truth.
Y'know my lady Lucindy?
The one with da big...
Not her, the one with the little...
Oh her.
No, not that. How 'bout...
She hates dem.
Too bad. How 'bout a dress?
Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky, sexy, little foxy...
Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose...
...to big. The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
Not for me, my woolly headed cotton pickin' friend for...
I thought you got rid of...
...that was Vicki, her best friend. Dat dress will cast ya round...
...dat's too much money. I can't 'ford it. I needs me a dress that cost no mo' than...
...aconite get it dat cheap.
I'll buy her a less expensive dress, so I can have some money left over to take her out to dinner.
I heard ya lady is wild.
No. That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.
Oh, because on our first date, she let me...
...no, she didn't...
...yes she did.
...I heard different, thought that was...
...not that time...
So when are you comin' to pick us up?
Around...
...too early...
...then what about...
...too late, maybe around...
...perfect...
That's what I like about you and me. We git along...
...like macaroni and cheese...
...like grits and butter...
I fell out of my bed last night.
You slept too near where you got in?
I slept too near where I fell out.
Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you? Using all dose ten dollar words?
Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?
Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me.
Ain't Jemima on the pancake box?
Dat's yo Uncle Ben. That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately.
How be dat?
I don't know who I am.
Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
Sleep 'N Eat, I was my wife's husband and grandchild at one and the same time. And lo' and behold, as the husband of a person's grandmother is his grandfather, I Mantan, became my own grandfather.
I feel a song a comin' on.
People show their happiness in a lot of different ways.
A lot?
So what's up with you?
What do you want to know?
The good stuff.
I'm an asthmatic. Been one all my life. Can't go anywhere without an inhaler.
What else?
This is a nice place. It must have cost a pretty penny.
Sloan, I got it like 'dat.
Oh you do, huh?
Just a little something' somethin'.
I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.
Gots no intention of ending up broke.
Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface. You ever heard of Bert Williams? He was a great artist.
No, before my time.
You don't read, do you?
Never read a book in my whole life.
Maybe you need to start.
Maybe I need to do a lot of things.
Why all of a sudden are you flippin' on me? This blackface thing was part of the deal from the git-go. Don't even try to play it like you ain't a part of all this. You down with Delacroix.
I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
Why don't you call him?
You're sure this is a good idea.
I'll be down front. You better start putting your face on.
Y'know what?
What?
How did you get this gig?
Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position.
You leave something out?
After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant.
And?
And what?
Stop playing me Sloan.
Just ask me what you want to know.
Oh, you gonna make me say it.
Say what, Manray?
Did you ever sleep with DeLa?
We did it one time, only once. It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid. Everything I've got I've earned.
Aw, c'mon.
So you say. Sloan, you wuz gonna use me up just like you used Dela? Work it to the top. I never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like "IHOP." I'm damn happy DeLa fired ya ass.
Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?
Don't try to change to the subject.
Why don't you answer?
I know I won't be your puppet.
You can go now.
Good day to you, young sir.
Good morning.
Where are you bound for?
That is none of your business.
Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?
And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan, I've been insulted grossly in this house. I ain't at all satisfied with these here ways of going on. I'm an Englishman, I am, and a man of property; and I -- I --
Both of us ride home with Best here.
I'm not afraid of highwaymen. My man is armed, and so am I.
There's nothing else for it. Take your ground, Grogan -- twelve paces, I suppose?
Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?
Hoity-toity! John Best, what's the matter here?
I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways. I ain't used to 'em, sir.
Well, well! What is it? We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.
It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady. If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.
Pooh! Pooh! Best, you are joking.
My companion treated me with great civility, and asked me a thousand questions about England, which I answered as best I might. But this best, I am bound to say, was bad enough. I knew nothing about England, and I invented a thousand stories which I told him; described the king and the ministers to him, said the British ambassador in Berlin was my
What is your uncle's name?
O'Grady.
This is a very good inn. Shall we stop for dinner?
This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland. Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.
Ah! You sly rogue, I see that will influence you.
The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.
Where's the beauty you promised me?
Upon my word, sir, I think you have acted very coolly.
I have acted as I think fit.
Sir, I'm a British officer.
It's a lie! You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know. Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?
Good morning, Private James. Please come in. I should like you to meet my uncle, Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein.
The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police, Herr Galgenstein, a relationship which, no doubt, aided in the younger gentlemen's promotion.
Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.
What is the service, sir?
You are a Hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins. He gambles a great deal, and wins. Do you know the cards well?
Only a very little, as soldiers do.
What are the Chevalier's intentions?
Has he sent the challenge yet?
You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner. When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on.
And his baggage?
This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.
Dorothy might love me or not, as she likes, but Best will have to fight me before he marries her!
A pretty day's work of it you have made, Master Roderick. Knowing your uncle to be distressed for money, and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a-year into the family? Best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so. He takes a girl without a penny -- a girl that has been
And so I am.
And this is the return you make for his kindness! Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?
Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan. I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine. Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?
Well, if it must be, it must. For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw. No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow.
He'll give the better mark. I am not afraid of him.
Have you taken my message to him?
The meeting is arranged. Captain Best is waiting for you now.
My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
That's a very handsome sword you have there.
It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck. He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly. But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.
And now you risk the same fate. If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.
I hope to spoil this sport, and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's body.
Oh, it's with pistols we fight. You are no match for Best with the sword.
I'll match any man with the sword.
But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame. He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now.
Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is silly business. The girl will marry Best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her. You are but a boy. Best is willing to consider you as such. Dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty
Grogan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters, and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me news which I wanted, of my family.
I had news of you in Dublin. Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother? She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.
I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office.
I see you are thinking of a certain young lady at Duganstown.
Is Miss Dugan well?
There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
Good heavens! Whatever? Has she died of grief?
She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband. She is now Mrs. John Best.
Mrs. John Best! Was there another Mr. John Best?!
No, the very same one, my boy. He recovered from his wound. The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him. It was only made of tow. Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family? The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for
The coward!
Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how grateful I am for your timely assistance to my wife.
I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls.
Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt, and rest assured, sir, you have friends in this house whenever you are in Dublin. Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know your good father?
Which O'Higgins do you know? For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family.
Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown. General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father, Colonel Granby Somerset.
Ah -- I see. No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown.
Whom have I been harboring in my house? Who are you, sirrah?
Sirrah! Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!
You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!
Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.
Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me.
I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
I don't know.
Your Grace owes me seventy thousand frederics, which I have honorably won.
Chevalier, if you will have your money now, you must fight for it. If you will be patient, maybe I will pay you something another time.
Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.
Where is my rascal, Lazlo?
Good gracious! What is this?
You are going to drive to the frontier.
It is shameful -- infamous! I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador's house.
I have orders to gag your honor if you cry out, and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not.
Ten thousand? But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
Your honor must lower his voice.
All Europe shall hear of this!
I have no luggage.
You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?
Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?
Yes, sir.
You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.
Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
For whom else have you worked?
No one, sir. Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins.
Who else can give me information about you?
And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred; for he, too, was an exile from home, and a friendly voice, a look, brought the old country back to his memory again, and the old days of his boyhood.
The cards are now my only livelihood. Sometimes I am in luck, and then I lay out my money in these trinkets you see. It's property, look you, and the only way I have found of keeping a little about me. When the luck goes against me, why, my dear, my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and I wear paste. Do you understand the
I can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill.
But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost.
Have no fear. It will come out well for me.
I believe they will deport you.
I have faced that problem before.
But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?
Make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, I warrant you. Do take a last look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in Berlin. The dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country, and, out of it, you shall go.
Gentlemen, I wish you a good day. Will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning, and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three Kings at Dresden?
When the Duke of Courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins, and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags, what did we ask?
It is distasteful to kill a scoundrel -- that should be work for a hangman.
To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.
I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him.
Certain?
I entered here, monsieur, at a bad moment for you; it seems that you love this lady.
Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?
Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals.
Very well! Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.
Then you yield to me.
On the instant. Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.
That is a trifle strong.
No.
Have you had one?
Never.
But, for a time... a passing fancy?
Not even that.
How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?
Not one.
Have you not a man whom you value?
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
What! You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more. I could value only someone whom I loved.
Then you have never loved? Your heart is empty.
Your word "empty" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate? If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself. If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it.
It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.
But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.
That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.
It is only too possible. Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.
I agree; but God put us on earth to take that risk.
A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.
I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.
How so?
You want my heart?
It is my only object.
To make me wretched in two weeks.
To love you until death. To subscribe to all your commands.
The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.
Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me. If I do not know it, I am innocent.
Be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are?
And if she does not choose to show you some kindness?
Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
You will do as you please. It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other. Do you not agree?
Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.
Poor man. And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
Will we always leave it at this?
Always, my dear one, never any further. Love is a child to be pacified with trifles. A full diet can only kill it.
I know better than you do. Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away.
Our abstinence makes our love immortal. If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more. But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.
Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.
My husband has convinced me of the contrary.
Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union -- and I was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead. And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in
Without you, my dearest, I might have died without ever knowing love. Inexpressible love! God of nature! Bitterness than which nothing is sweeter, sweetness than which nothing is more bitter. Divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes.
Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy.
As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you. But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself. I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.
My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with me was a singular one. Her life was passed in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me. We would quarrel for a fortnight, then we should be friends for a month together sometimes. One day, I was joking her, and asking her whether she would take the water again, whether she had found
Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.
I accept, but I insist on a wager. The loser must do whatever the winner pleases.
Agreed.
I feel the ribbon.
Why are you shaking?
I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do! And I only danced with her because -- because -- the person with whom I intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night.
I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.
Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man. He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?
But you refused me, Dorothy.
Oh! I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner. Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.
If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two. I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.
Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side.
I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.
What, with me on the pillion? Would you kill poor me?
Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do. I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.
Monster! Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop. But I'll have my revenge, I will! Roddy, will you see me insulted?
I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove. How much do you wish to spend?
As much as possible.
As much as possible?
Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.
All the same, you must name an amount.
Last month, the Duke of Suffolk spent no more.
And, to be sure, I did know someone who knew precisely how these things were done, and this was the distinguished solicitor and former Government Minister, Lord West, whose acquaintance I made, as I had so many others, at the gaming table.
Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs?
By name only.
Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?
Yes!
Does this assignment interest you?
Was he cheated?
In so far as I can tell these things -- no. I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.
A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible.
The King has determined to send the Chevalier out of the country.
Then this must be done tomorrow.
What has happened, madam, to annoy your ladyship?
Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong. Have you lost much?
That fool didn't know what was the meaning of a hundred-pound bill, which was in the pocket-book that the fellow took from me.
I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.
But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
As you have been robbed of your purse, may I have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home?
How different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan assemblies. In every sentence, she mentioned a lord or a person of quality. To the lady's question about my birth and parentage, I replied that I was a young gentleman of large fortune, that I was going to Dublin for my studies, and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum.
I have good news for you, Mr. Cosgrove. The firm of Bracegirdle and Chatwick, in the city of London, are prepared to lend you 20,000 pounds, pledged against your interest in the Edric mines. They will redeem the encumbrances against the property, which amount to some 10,000 pounds, and take a twenty- year working lease on the mines. They will lend you the 20,000
Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.
Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you. I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. But, obviously, if you would reject this offer, I shall keep trying to find a better one.
I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe.
There are a few other points we should discuss. The loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship's signature, and provided that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be assured of her ladyship's freewill in giving her signature.
Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill? Are you serious?
May I be quite frank with you?
Yes, of course.
Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life, and meditated a separation, in which case, she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance, and subject them, at any rate, to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point, and said they must have absolute assurance of
I see.
Did you buy the horse, papa?
Now, just have a little patience, my boy. Your birthday isn't until next week.
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
Good night, papa.
Good night, my little darling.
Papa?
Yes?
One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in. Is that true, papa?
I promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to Doolan's farm to see him.
Your bother is in America fighting the rebels.
Is he all right, papa?
Yes, he's fine.
I made Sir William Cosgrove's acquaintance as usual at the play- table. One could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime; for, though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases, a cripple wheeled about in a chair, and suffering pangs of agony, yet you would see him every morning, and every evening at his post
Indeed, you are right, sir. Look at me. Marriage has added forty years to my life. I am dying, a worn-out cripple, at the age of fifty. When I took off Lady Cosgrove, there was no man of my years who looked so young as myself. Fool that I was! I had enough with my pensions, perfect freedom, the best society in Europe --
Would you have me spend my life all alone?
In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.
The milkmaid's daughter?
Sir William Cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches. He was continually tinkered up by doctors, and, what with my usual luck, he might be restored to health and live I don't know how many years. If Cosgrove would not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady? But my fears were to prove groundless, for on
Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?
I beg your pardon?
Come, come, sir. I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.
Gentlemen, see this amiable youth! He has been troubled by religious scruples, and has flown for refuge to my chaplin, Mr. Hunt, who has asked for advise from my wife, Lady Cosgrove, and between them both, they are confirming my ingenious young friend in his faith. Did you ever hear of such doctors and such a disciple?
Faith, sir, if I want to learn good principles, it's surely better I should apply for them to your lady, and your chaplin than to you?
Well, if my intentions are what you think they are -- if I do wish to step into your shoes, what then? I have no other intentions than you had yourself. Lady Cosgrove's wealth may be great, but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily? Her rank is lofty, but not so lofty as my ambition. I will be
Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor? Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?
I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?
Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps. Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation. Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.
Sir, let those laugh that win.
Charming Schuvaloff.
Black-eyed Sczortarska.
Dark Valdez.
Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
Yes. He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
And he doesn't care about me?
He is only curious to know who you are.
If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.
He loves me, as I love you.
Will he wish to know the details of this night?
He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.
Don't like 'em, don't eat 'em, don't make no damn difference to me.
Can I at least have a drink?
It's ten thirty in the morning.
Yeah, if you've slept.
You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.
Hurricane kept you up, too?
Bill Styles...
Who?
Don't you ever point a gun at me!
A target, Kendall, cap a fucking target. What's wrong with you?
I thought I was gonna have an attack. Go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou. Childs could tell I wasn't right.
Fuck, what the fuck is going on --
What do we do?
I don't want to go --
Did -- did you --
What about Pike?
He is the only one unaccounted for.
You framed-him...
This isn't our area. Whose area is this --
Hey, I -- Holy fuck... holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
You killed him you fucking faggot --
We got -- I don't know, we got separated
Before or after the explosion? Mueller --
Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You just shut the FUCK UP.
West was one thing, but this --
We finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion -- Where's Pike?
What about you, wandering around alone? At least we have an alibi --
Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
Yeah, right...
You too?
Why not?
I asked for a policeman.
You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?
It's... too slow.
Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.
I just don't like it.
I don't know... I like the Army.
C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here.
You did Basic here?
There's no need...
Right. Now, I'm gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more, okay?
Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?
I'm not telling you what happened.
Some.
And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you?
You smoke, Ray?
This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.
Hey, Ray! Just had a nice talk with your buddy Kendall -- seems you killed three people!
That son of a bitch.
That'd be my reaction too --
He's lying.
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
Fuck "you're serious", Raymond, you got exactly zero truck with us; right now we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours, so if you've got something to say, say it.
So Childs made some side money, so what? People are dead, Ray, and the only one we have to blame is you --
I didn't shoot West --
I apologize --
You saw West's body.
And he'd been shot.
You shot Childs and Nunez.
They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
You saved Kendall's life --
Raymond, for you to have any chance of coming out of this, we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony. Otherwise this is just another story --
We're not finished yet --
We don't need the tapes --
Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?
Not true, Cadet, I've got a gun --
He -- He made me do it --
Do what?
I guess Nunez wasn't dead after all. He came after us with a vengeance. You know the rest.
And the bodies?
I promised them I'd ask you where West and the others are...
Washout rejects, guys he said were "dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead"...
Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?
That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300.
Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?
Epilepsy.
He said he worked there --
No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?
What business?
Where?
What about the phosphorous grenade?
Back up.
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?
Where's the cabin?
You kept Kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end. You even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him, too.
Is that what I did, now? And of course, you can prove all of it.
We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
Ohhhh, I don't think so...
How do you know that?
Cadet, what's your name!
Sir, Dunbar, sir!
You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty- four hours! He is not to be given food, water, or clothes! If he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear?
Sir, yes, sir!
What the fuck is going on?
He wouldn't kill anybody...
Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --
Shut up. Let me see your grenades.
Why?
Jesus, what happened?
Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close.
So you killed him?
Whose blood is that, Jay?
What do you mean, West's?
Where have you been, Jay?
Roberto, what the fuck?
We just want to check your pack --
You know it's not like that --
Right?
You gotta untie me. I didn't do this thing, Ray.
You hated West more than any of us.
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
You're the only one missing a grenade.
Ray, this is my life here. I ain't gonna pretend I'm not happy West is gone, but you know I couldn't have done this. It's not in me.
If not you, then who?
Mueller.
Oh, come on --
We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --
That's exactly what he says about you.
You hated West, Mueller loved him --
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
Bullshit.
Look in my pack.
Why?
Combat grade morphine. Mueller sold it to me.
You're lying --
Why... why didn't you tell me?
That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.
You saw West, right? How was he killed?
Full clip to the body --
From up close or far away?
His chest was hamburger --
Way I figure it, West must have found out about their little business and was gonna bust them, so they decided to get rid of him first...
They?
I... I don't know...
What don't you know?
There's no time to think, Ray, we gotta get out of here! You untie me, we grab the guns, get Kendall and Nunez, and make a run for it --
No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --
A test will no doubt link you to the killing --
You... I've seen you around the Base. But you... You're not Army, are you?
That's it. You're that policeman with friends in low places. Tell me, how's Guissepe Torres doing these days? Those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer --
I've done nothing wrong. I'm the victim here.
But not the only victim, right?
My father is a powerful man. Over the years he's used that power to protect me, in one form or another, from certain... unpleasantries. I am a homosexual.
Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you think of that?
I think you just blew "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" out of the fucking water.
Levi, I don't know if you're familiar with investigative work, but we have this little thing called "motive" and you just gave yourself one.
You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.
What happened to "degrees"?
I didn't kill him --
Maybe I shouldn't tell you that. Maybe I should tell you I wasn't scared at all. But I was... Enough to almost kill him.
But you didn't.
He admitted it.
Why did he come back for you?
Okay. I think that's it. He rises and walks to the door.
Somebody emptied a full clip into him --
You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar --
How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer.
Is it the truth?
Why did you tell us he shot everybody, Levi? You put him in for three murders, the man saved your life --
So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
No. I said Dunbar.
I believe your next line is "What are you trying to hide?"
Well?
Dunbar will testify that you were.
Something funny, Levi?
Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not --
Why?
How do you know?
Or you, Levi? When is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him?
I didn't --
You lied to us, Levi, you're going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them!
I don't know --
Where are they!
Maybe --
MAYBE WHAT --
How are you?
Been better. I read about what's been happening with you... I should have called --
That bad?
Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way --
This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne, the closest thing we have to an in- house investigator.
The official term for it is "Clusterfuck". By the time Beth hit us, I'd canceled all off base exercises save one -- a six man cadet team and their Drill out in the bush. We're missing three and the Sergeant. The cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle, nobody here knows much about them, up to and including their names. But the
A few years ago, the Army picked our good buddy as their go to non-com to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder, gentler military. He even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming Basic cadets across the country.
The exercise was one of his Section Eight "private sessions". Left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning.
And the problem is you only got three.
No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
Which gives us about five hours. Why'd you call me?
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
Tom, bottom line: I let those kids go out there. If JAG shows up and I don't have any answers for them, my career is finished --
He's not done by a longshot, I can get more out of him --
Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.
Who killed Pike?
We've already been over the terrain twice. Nothing.
There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.
Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --
Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.
From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.
Nevertheless --
Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.
You mean not enough to save you.
Tom, where are you going --
Home, I'm done.
You want a confession? Why don't you confess, Bill: people are dead and you don't give a shit about it! Only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job, you know this is your fault --
What the hell are you talking about --
What I said before --
Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?
Yeah.
It's over. Time of death was 4:42. JAG's been notified and I called the Senator myself. My report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable... you two had no culpability in the matter.
That's horseshit and you know it.
You think you could explain all this to me?
They're taking your command, aren't they?
I'm sorry, Bill.
Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.
You're a good soldier, Bill.
It was so good, I actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. The Base Commander. The one in control. You couldn't let him testify, could you?
What are you talking about?
If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
You're drunk --
Stay where you are.
Or what? You've gone round the bend --
What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.
That's preposterous --
Toxicology report came back. Kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you've heard of it. It's for asthmatics. If an epileptic takes enough, it kills them. I checked with the nurses at the hospital -- you're the only other person who visited Kendall.
I wanted to see if he was okay --
You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike.
I'm not even going to dignify that --
No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it --
You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.
No more witnesses. West's a ghost. But it doesn't matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and Kendall's toxicology report. And that'll be enough.
You're crazy --
You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen.
For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about --
Hostile and uncooperative.
Ah, Christ
You knew Sergeant West?
I didn't mean that as a compliment.
Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.
Gotta be honest, I love what you've done with the place --
You and the Colonel go back.
He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.
You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.
