Sure, after a fashion.
Let me try.
You? Why I'm sure it would pale in comparison to the actual experience.
So how was it?
That... was... no... simulation.
I know. I'm sorry...
I have been to the dark side. I have seen a world that no man should ever see.
Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...
This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood.
Welcome to LesterCorp. May we meet your filing needs?
No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz. I have an interview with Mr. Lester.
Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez...
Schwartz.
Pardon?
Schwartz.
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I have no idea what you're saying right now.
My name is Schwartz.
Money, Miss Warts?
Mr. Juarez?
Yes?
Yex?
I said "yes."
You're not like the other boys we've had here. Granted, I can't understand what you're saying either, but your soft palette resonates tremendously well and you never ever constrict your epiglottis.
I am a trained performer.
Floris, you're very nice, but I'm afraid Im in love with somebody else.
Come in, Mr. Juarez. I'd stand, but, well, you know.
Security.
No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.
She's not my secretary. She's what they call an executive liaison, and I'm not banging her, if that's what youre implying.
Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply misspoke.
Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you feel you can bring to LesterCorp?
Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.
You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
Glooph is not a letter, sir.
You don't have a speech impediment, Dr. Lester.
Flattery will get you everywhere, my boy. But I'm afraid I have to trust Floris on this one. You see, she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from Case Western. Perhaps you've read her memoirs, "I can't understand a word any of you are saying."
No.
Pity, it tells it like it is. That's why the eastern, read Jewish, publishing establishment won't touch it. That's a quote from the book jacket. George Will, I think. I apologize if you can't understan a word I'm saying, Dr. Schwartz.
No. I understand perfectly.
Thank you for being kind enough to lie. You see, I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. You're hired. Any questions?
Just one. Why is this floor so short?
Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz. Why, if I were eighty years younger, I'd box your ears.
I wasn't toying with her, sir. I was just... How old are you?
One hundred and five. Carrot juice. Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost not worth it. I piss orange. Oh, and I, have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. But nobody wants to die, Schwartz.
I'll keep that in mind, sir.
No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me.
The elderly have so much to offer, sir. They are our link with history.
I don't want to be your godamn link, damn you. I want to feel Floris' naked thighs against my own. I want to know passion. I want my body to inspire lust in that beautiful, complex woman. I want her to shiver in a spasm of ecstasy when I penetrate her. Oh, God, the agony of the flesh, Schwartz.
Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that you share your feelings with me, I believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion.
Imagine a room full of women. Nubile, blonde, wet with desire, Schwartz. A harem, if you will. Me in leather. A harness, if you like. I am the object of this desire, and all eyes are on me as I speak. Ladies, I begin. I am the love god, Eros. I intoxicate you. My spunk is to you manna from heaven...
Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now.
Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig.
Yessir.
Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us? You can come too if you like, Schwartz.
Dr. Lester. . .
Ah, Craig. Just the fellow I wanted to see. Juicer! Easy as pie. Just keep your fingers clear of the blade, and never, never use it while bathing in a tub full of water.
Dr. Lester, I have a question. I was in that vacant office down the hall and I stumbled upon a little door and....
Ah. yes, the little door. There is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes. If you hurry, you'll just make it.
Dr. Lester...
More beet-spinach juice, my friend?
No thank you sir. It's delicious, though. I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to work at LesterCorp, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to tender my resignation effectively immediately.
I see. Are you unhappy at our little company?
No sir, not at all. It's just that I'm going to open my own business and...
And what sort of business will this be? If you don't mind my asking.
Uh, import-export. Olive oil. Right on 7 1/2 actually. In the vacant office. So we'll still be seeing each other.
You're making a big mistake, Schwartz. Ma'am
Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
There are rules, boy, procedures, etiquette. This is not a toy. I've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room, grooming myself, quietly setting the stage, performing ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all his motion pictures again and again. Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping properly.
You're insane.
Moving story.
Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
Is that true?
Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?.
Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.
How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!
Emily Dickinson.
Yes, well...
You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.
And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
No, really.
What?
I just wanted to say hi. Did you know I still don't know your name or where you work?
Yeah.
How about this, if I can guess your first name within three tries, you have to come out for a drink with me tonight.
Why not?
Great. Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. Maxine?
Who told you?
I'm right?
Who told you?
That's incredible! Nobody told me! I swear! It's kismet. Maxine! It's a beautiful name. There's a psychic connection. Don't you see? It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine! Maxine! I will shout it from the rooftops!
Somebody told you.
Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine, Maxine. It just came out of me like a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy, song, Maxine. Maxine. Maxine!
I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk. So help me, if I find out you cheated.
Made it. Maxine. Maxine, Maxine, Maxine.
Just.
Buy you a drink, Maxine?
You married?
What'll you have?
The usual, Barry.
I like you. I don't know what it is exactly.
My tits?
No, no, it's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or...
That's the usual?
Im not a homosexual. I just like women for more than their bodies. I guess you could say I'm the new American male.
You're a fag or a liar.
I mean, I am really attracted to you.
No, wait! I like your tits. I love your tits. I want to fuck you.
So, tell me about yourself. If you can get your mind out of the gutter long enough, dog-boy.
Hi.
You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.
Puppets. Maxine. It's the idea of being inside someone else, feeling what they feel, seeing what they see...
Yikes.
It's just, and I've never done this before, Maxine, but it's just that I feel something for you. I've never felt this before for anyone, not even my wife. My future is with you, Maxine.
Don't you want to know what happened to me?
This is important!
There's a tiny door in that empty office. It's a portal, Maxine. It takes you inside John Malkovich. You see the world through John Malkovich's eyes, then, after about fifteen minutes, you're spit out into a ditch on the side of The New Jersey Turnpike.
Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.
What's he been in?
Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you
Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
Good. We'll sell tickets.
Tickets to Malkovich?
Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.
Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me.
You wanted to be partners with me?
Sure. It'd be fun.
Really? But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!
Okay. Here it is. Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding. Only two hundred dollars for fifteen minutes. Visit J.M. Inc., Mertin-Flemmer Building. etc., etc.
Craig, I just don't find you attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten with you, but only when you're in Malkovich. When I looked into his eyes last night, I could feel you peering out. Behind the stubble and the too-prominent brow and the male pattern baldness, I sensed your feminine longing peering out, and it just slew me.
This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!
You're late.
Are you torturing me on purpose?
I've fallen in love.
I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.
You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad for the skin.
You're evil, Maxine.
You're glowing again.
Lotte, this is so good...
Lotte? Is that you?
Let him try.
What happens when a man climbs through his own portal?
But I gotta go now. I've got to go be Johnny.
Hello, Don.
Hello. Wendy.
Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
So that's the story of 7 1/2. Since the rents are considerably lower this floor has been adopted by businesses which for one reason or another are forced to cut corners After all... the overhead is low! Ha ha ha!
Hi. Wendy! What're you up to in this vacant office.
Well, Don, I peeked in here, even though I know it's against floor policy. and I discovered that there's a little tiny door in here. Isn't it cute? It's almost like a little dolly's door. I wonder what its for.
You've got to tell Craig what's going on. He must never leave Malkovich.
I'm glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it?
Must you take this terrible demon on yourself, my love?
Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and...
I'll be with you always, my friends. Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll rejoin you with wings and a beak.
No.
Long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
No. Don't be an ass.
Can I be anyone I want?
You can be John Malkovich.
Well that's perfect. My second choice. Ah, this is wonderful. Too good to be true! You see, I'm a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh, I've tried all the diets, my friends. Lived for a year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise. Did it work? You be the judge. But Malkovich! King of New York! Man about town! Most eligible bachelor! Bon Vivant!
Two hundred dollars, please.
Boy, this is a toughie. To be honest, I didn't anticipate this.
And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich.
Right, Lester. I heard you the first time. I'm not a dummy.
Didn't mean to imply that you were, sir.
Have a seat. I wracking my brain over this Malkovich thing.
We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
Vegas? What'd you think?
The kid's got talent. You've never seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz had him up there singing and dancing. Impressions.
Impressions? Those are hard.
Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad we can't kill him.
I suppose I could come to him in a dream. I don't know. That's the best I can think of right now.
A scary dream?
No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary dream.
How'd it go? Did you say the philodendron gets water or no?
No, for God's sake, I just watered it yesterday. It almost went well. I gave a pretty good dream, but circumstances arose.
What kind of circumstances?
Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.
The Great Mantini?
No, the Mediocre Mantini. Of course the Great Mantini!
Oh, he's good! Great, actually. I saw him do "Tru" with his sixty foot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational.
But I think I have another plan.
Do tell. I love a good plan.
I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan.
Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry?
I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.
I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
Fine. Let's drop it.
Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.
Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.
Floris, get Guinness on the phone.
Gehginnis ondah foam?
Forget it.
Fork ah did?
Yes, my dear?
Someone names A Lot of Warts on line two.
Thank you, Floris.
Think, Jew florist?
Do you dream often?
Do you?
It's my job to ask the questions. Yours to answer them.
Says who?
Says me. Do you dream often?
It's like nothing I've ever felt before. I think I'm going crazy.
I'm sure you're not going crazy.
Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've...
Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
You were stoned. Case closed. End of story. How hot is this babe?
I think it might've been this Lotte woman talking through me. Maxine likes to call me Lotte.
Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you to channel some dead lesbian lover. Let me know when you're done with her. This is my type of chick.
I'm done with her now. Tonight really creeped me out.
You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend.
I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.
I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
You don't look a day over one hundred and five, Captain. What's your secret?
Anybody else?
Do we get to wear a crown?
But of course.
Count me in.
Tell me, Lotte, can you understand a word I'm saying?
Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.
Oh, be still my heart.
Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
I'm getting divorced.
No you mustn't, my child.
But why, Son of Malkovich?
I blew it, Dr. Lester.
You followed your heart, my child, and that is not necessarily a bad thing.
But now we've lost access to Craig.
You know I think it pays to leave juice-making to the trained professionals. You look terrible, my dear.
Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.
Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself!
No, I didn't know that.
Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
No.
Aaaahhhh, the portal!
No! Don't harm the vessel!
It's Craig in there, I can tell.
Thank you all for your efforts, but I'm afraid we can no longer get into Malkovich through the portal.
Why not? I need to get in there!
I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.
That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
Yes, hello, I wanted to place an ad. Hi, are you Craig's wife?
Hi. Have you done Malkovich yet?
Don't stand in the way of my actualization as a man, Craig.
And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich, my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me.
Ah.
Yes?
I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
When?
Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.
I love you, Lotte.
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else can be.
I have to see you.
We have to meet.
Maxine! Listen: It hasn't been me in John the last three times. Craig's had me locked up in the apartment. He made me call you at gunpoint. It's been him! Oh, God, it's been him!
Really? Well, you know, he's quite good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I'll speak with you soon.
But Maxine, I thought it was me you loved.
Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show.
Did you see the reviews?
Yeah, I saw them
She's not available.
How do we do that?
A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
What's the play?
Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.
Never heard of it.
Broadway's finest three hours. It's about the suppression of the individual. Conformity as God in modern society.
Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
Nothing but acting to hide behind, buddy-boy.
I'm not afraid. I toured for a year with the National Puppet Company's production of "Long Day's Journey Into Night."
Great then.
Is there dancing?
No.
Yeah?
Mr. Malkovich?
Who's calling?
You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours.
How'd you get this number?
Can I get you a drink?
Thanks so much for coming over.
So, do you enjoy being an actor?
I'm sorry, did you just call me "Lotte"?
Do you mind?
Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte.
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes! What the fuck is going on? I'm not talking. This is not me!
Something was making me talk. Some Goddamn thing was making me move. I gotta get out of here.
Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.
Darling!
Come on in.
I can explain about the portal, darling.
Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I just let you up here to tell you that, and to tell you that I'm taking you and Schwartz to court.
Yes. How did you know it was me?
Lotte called me.
Oh, so the bitch escaped.
Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
I'm getting better all the time.
I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.
You still there, sweets?
Yeah. I've figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough, it's all in the wrists.
Wow. Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.
You mean with Malkovich?
I'd love to see your work.
That was incredible. You're brilliant!
You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.
Stay in him forever?
No! But how will we make a living, my love, if our clientele doesn't have access to our product?
Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.
No! Please! Shut up, will you? We're trying to think here. It is sort of like being a puppeteer. I like that about it.
No one would ever have to know its not him.
Wait a minute! What if everybody knew? What if we presented Malkovich as the world's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor with the Great Mantini!
Shut up! Sorry, dear, I lost control for a minute.
Vegas.
This is it, lover. You're stepping onto that stage a nobody and presto-change-o, you're coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen.
Doesn't he know how important tonight is to us?
They love me, darling! "Craig Schwartz is fantastic!" The New York Times. "If only Craig Schwartz had always been inside Malkovich!" Women's Wear Daily. "Craig Schwartz - The world's greatest puppeteer!" Paul Wunder, WBAI Radio.
Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top.
Sleepy suddenly.
Bad dream, darling?
I've got to leave Malkovich.
You've got to be kidding.
Honey, we can be happy and poor together.
Yeah what?!
Good-bye, Maxine.
Captain Mertin?
What want ye, girl child?
I am not a child, Captain Mertin, but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions.
I see. Well, it is not my fault that thou art tiny. So if it is charity yer after, then be gone with ye, ye foul demon.
I am not asking for alms, but rather the ear of a kind man with a noble heart.
Aye. Speak then if ye must.
Why you never go back to Lady Jone's and learn your letters? You liked going there I remember. Seeing the other children. Then all a sudden, you stop.
You got to go sometime. You got to go out there by yourself sometime.
But you said...you said out there, there ain't no...what was that word?..no..de- fense. No de-fense.
There ain't.
Then what do I do?
Folks came.
Folks come. Folks go.
I got a delivery around here. Name of Tucker.
Well?
Well what?
This Saturday - you coming to Call or what?
If I call them, and they come what on earth am I going to say to them.
The Word. What you was put here to speak.
That's the last thing they took from me.
But you got to do it. You got to. Can't nobody Call like you. You have to be there.
What I have to do is get in my bed and lay down. I want to fix on something harmless in this world.
What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here.
Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.
You getting into bed to think about yellow?
I likes yellow.
Then what? When you get through with blue and yellow, then what?
Can't say. It's something can't be planned.
You blaming God. That what you're doing?
No, Stamp. I ain't.
You saying whitefolks won. That what you saying?
Those white things have taken all I had or dreamed. I'm saying ain't no bad luck in this world 'cept for white folks..They just don't know when to stop.
You saying nothing counts?
I'm saying they came into my yard.
You saying God give up? Nothing left for us but pour out our own blood?
I'm saying they came into my yard.
You punishing Him, ain't you?
Not like He punished me.
You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.
Was a time I knew what was.
You still know.
What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.
We have to be steady. "These things too will pass". What you looking for? A miracle?
No. Sorry.
They'll be all right. I'm surprised they lasted here this long.
I don't know. Maybe we should have moved.
What'd be the point? Not a house in the country ain't packed to the rafters with some dead Negro's grief. We lucky our ghost is a baby. My husband spirit come back? Or yours? Don't talk to me! Ha..You lucky. You got one child left, still pullin at your skirts. Be thankful. I had eight. Eight with six fathers. Every one of them gone
You remember Halle.
Oh, I remember bits and pieces of all of'em I guess..Halle, of course..I had Halle a lifetime. Almost twenty years... My two girls, sold and gone before I could even a heard about it, and them without their grown up teeth yet. My third child, my son after Halle...I let that straw boss have me for four months so's I could keep that boy.
The boys wouldn't have left if Halle were here.
...All I remember is how she loved the bottom of burned bread. Her little hands...I wouldn't know 'em if they slapped me".
..I swallowed her blood right along with my mother's milk. She played with me and always came to be with me whenever I needed her. Me and her waited for our daddy. I love her. I do. She never hurt me. I love my mother but I know she killed one of her own, and tender as she is with me, I'm scared of
Beloved..She's mine I am Beloved
YOU HURT ME.
WATCH OUT FOR HER; SHE CAN GIVE YOU DREAMS.
WHERE ARE THE MEN WITHOUT SKIN?
What do you know about it? I sleep where I want.
DID YOU COME FROM THE OTHER SIDE.
YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
YOU CAME BACK BECAUSE OF ME?
YES.
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
WILL YOU STAY?
WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHO AM YOU?
CAN THEY GET IN HERE?
You don't sit with me!!
Baby, don't be like that.
You don't sit with me!! I don't sit with people who leave me!
Don't talk like that. Your mama loves you.
I had another dream last night. The dead man laying on top of me and I had nothing to eat. And the ghosts without skin stuck their fingers in me and said Beloved in the dark and bitch in the light..
Don't say those things. You forget about those dreams..
You gave me the bad dreams. You left me behind...
Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing!
You're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me..
I want somethin' sweet.
We don't have nothing sweet no more, baby.
Not for me, you don't! You don't let me eat the pies...
Well, is it now? How you getting along?
Don't pay to complain.
You on your way home?
No. Got me an afternoon job at the shirt factory. Figure between that and my night work at the Bodwins I might be able to put something away for me and mama.
They treating you right over at the Bodwins?
Your mother all right?
No. Not a bit all right. Hasn't gotten out of bed since that day.
You think I should stop by? Think she'd welcome it?
That girl...You know, Beloved...
Yes?
She gone like they say?
Haven't seen her since that day. Ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but..I don't think so. Mama thinks she's gone for good. Says she can feel it.
You think she sure 'nough your sister?
Well, if you want my opinion...
I don't. I have my own.
You grown.
Yes sir
Well, good luck with the job.
And Paul D...you don't have to stay 'way, but be careful how you talk to my mama, hear?
Yes?
May I come in?
What you want?
I want to see Mr. and Mrs. Bodwin.
Miss Bodwin. They brother and sister, darlin.
Oh.
What you want'em for?
I'm looking for work. I was thinking they might know of some.
You Baby Sugg's kin, ain't you?
Yes ma'am.
I heard your mother took sick, that so?
Yes ma'am..
You know what? I've been here since I was fourteen and I remember like yesterday when Baby Suggs, holy, came here and sat right where you are. Whiteman name of Garner brought her. He and Mr. Bodwin were good friends. That's how she got that house you all live in. Other things too.
Yes ma'am.
I never went to those woodland services but she was always nice to me. Always. Never be another like her.
I miss her.
Bet you do. Everybody miss her. That was a good woman...Well, I don't know whether the Bodwins think it or not but they sure could use some extra help.
Ya think?
They getting older now and I can't take care of 'em like I used to. More and more they keep asking me to sleep over night. Now, I don't want to quit these people but they can't have all my days and nights too. I got my own family needs me. It'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper - take
Fine. But what would I do at night?
Be here. In case.
In case of what?
They good whitefolks?
I want to work, Miss Lady.
Work? Start learnin your letters again?
No. I mean work work.
Well, what can you do?
I can't do anything but I would learn it for you if you have a little extra.
Extra?
Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but I could do chores in the mornings.
Oh baby...I don't know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves...But if you all need to eat until your mother's well, all you have to do is say so...We have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry.
Back stiff?
OOh, yeah...Don't know if it's the floor or the skating.
Could be that fall you took.
Should I wake her?
No, let her rest.
She likes to see you off in the morning.
I'll make sure she does. But first I'm going make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.
Won't you be late for work?
DON'T LOVE HER TOO MUCH.
OUT THERE. WAY OFF.
Morning.
MAMA!
Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up.
But mama..
Mama let me help you.
Nobody..no sir..that's right..nobody's going be doing that..nobody going be writing my daughter's characteristics on the animal side..no sir..I don't care..ain't laying that down..no sir. I refuse..that's right..that's right...
Mama...Mama she's asleep. Why don't you eat something.
She likes this dress...
No...no...no..
Where you been keeping yourself? I told John must be cold if Stamp stay inside.
Out where?
Was over to Baby Suggs.
What you want there? Somebody invite you in?
Somebody new there. A woman. Thought you might know who she is.
Ain't no new Negroes in this town I don't know about. What she look like? You sure that wasn't Denver?
I know Denver.
You sure?
I know what I see.
Might see anything at all at 124.
True.
Better ask Paul D.
Can't locate him.
He's sleeping in the church.
The church!
Yeah. Asked Rev. Pike if he could stay in the cellar.
It's cold as charity in there! What he do that for? Any number'll take him in.
Can't nobody read minds long distance. All he have to do is ask somebody.
Why? Why he have to ask? Can't nobody offer? What's going on? Since when a black man come to town have to sleep in the cellar like a dog?!
Unrile yourself, Stamp. It's only a few days he been there.
NO! Shouldn't be no days! You know all about it and don't give him a hand? That don't sound like you, Ella. Me and you been pulling colored folk out the water more'n twenty years! Now you tell me you can't offer a man a bed?! A working man who can pay his own way?
He ask, I give him anything.
Why's that necessary all of a sudden?
I don't know him that well.
You know he's colored? What else there to know?
Stamp, don't tear me up this morning! I don't feel like it.
It's her, ain't it?
Her who?
Sethe. He took up with her and stayed in there and you don't want nothing to-
Hold on! Don't jump if you can't see bottom!
Well, who can tell what went on in there? I never even knew who Sethe was or none of her people.
You know she married Baby Suggs' boy.
I ain't sure I know that. Baby never laid eyes on her till she showed up here. And how'd she make it and her husband didn't? And where is he? And how she have that baby in the woods by herself? Said a whitewoman help her. Shoot. You believe that? Well, I know what kind of white that was.
Aw, no, Ella.
Anything white floating around in the woods - if it don't got a shotgun, it's something the Lord tells me I don't want no part of.
You was friends.
Till she showed herself.
Ella.
I ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children.
What's any of that got to do with Paul D.?
What run him off? Tell me that!
I run him off.
You?
I told him...Showed him the newspaper. About Sethe. Read it to him. He left that very day.
You didn't tell me that. I thought he already knew.
He didn't know nothing. And nobody. Except her, from when they was at that place Baby Suggs was at.
He knew Baby Suggs?
Sure he knew her. Her boy Halle, too.
But you didn't come here talking 'bout Paul. You came asking about a new girl.
That's so.
Well, Paul D. must know who she is. Or what she is.
You mind loaded with spirits. Everywhere you look you see one.
This is hard for me. But I got to do it. Two things I got to say to you. I'm a take the easy one first.
If it's hard for you, might kill me dead.
I come looking for you to ask your pardon. Apologize.
For what?
You pick any house, any house where colored live. Pick any one and you welcome to stay there. I'm apologizing 'cause they didn't offer to tell you. But you welcome anywhere you want to be. My house. John and Ella. Miss Lady Jones..anybody. You choose. You ain't got to sleep in no cellar and I apologize for each and every night.
Well I...I did get offered one place but I just wanted to be off by myself a spell.
Oh yeah. Oh that's load off. I thought everybody gone crazy.
Just me.
You planning to do anything about it?
You remember your price, Stamp?
Never found out.
I did. Down to the cent.$900. Always wondered though what Mrs. Garner got for my brother Paul F. Must of been more than nine hundred dollars cause she use that money for Sweet Home for almost two years. But then they hung my other brother Paul A. up on a tree so I guess he wasn't worth the same..I wonder what was Baby Suggs
No use thinking these things now.
Oh but we got to. How we gonna know our price in the future? How are children's children's children gonna know what they cost? Who's gonna tell them? What are they gonna pay for us, if we free?
Children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing.
They'll know. They'll know as soon as they born. Cause it's inside us,Stamp. It'll be inside them. We'll pass it down. Schoolteacher didn't just change the outside, he changed the mind..and the blood..and what it carries...and what it's worth..
I don't believe that. I won't.
I said I had two things to say to you. I only told you one. I have to tell you the other.
I don't want to know.
I was there Paul D...There in the yard. When she did it.
Jesus.
It ain't what you think.
You don't know what I think.
She ain't crazy. She love those children. She was trying to outhurt the hurter's all.
Leave off..
She was only-
Stamp, leave off I said! I knew her when she was a girl. She scares me and I knew her when she was a girl...
You ain't scared of Sethe. I don't believe you.
She scares me. I scare me. And that girl in her house scares me.
Who is she? Where she come from?
Don't know. Just shot up one day from a stump.
Tell me something, Stamp. Tell me this one thing. How much is a nigger supposed to take?
All he can. All he can.
Sethe?
You shaved.
Yeah. Look bad?
No, You looking good.
Devil's confusion. What's this I hear about you not getting out of bed? I saw Denver. She tell you?
She comes in the daytime. She still with me, my Denver.
You got to get up from here, girl.
I'm tired, Paul. So tired. I have to rest a while.
Don't you die on me!! This is Baby Suggs quilt. Is that what you planning!?
Oh, I don't have no plans. No plans at all.
What, baby?
She left me. She's gone again.
Aw, girl. Don't cry...Me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow...
What the hell you thinking, girl? Strolling in here this late?
Don't talk to me, Mr. Sawyer. Don't say nothing to me this morning.
What? What? You talking back to me?
Not too sweet! You make it too sweet they don't eat it.
Make it the way I always do.
Hey!!
Yes sir.
I'm looking for a gal name of Judy. Works over by the slaughterhouse. Said she lived on Plank Road.
Plank Road. Yes sir. That's up a ways. Mile, maybe.
You don't know her? Judy? Works in the slaughterhouse.
Look here..There's a cross up there, so I guess this here's a church or used to be. Seems to me like you ought to show it some respect, you follow me?
Hiya Allan.
Sure Allan, I'll be there.
Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the tenth.
Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.
Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.
Yeah?
Wasn't this guy supposed to be a millionaire?
Fuck.
What do you think?
Pin your diapers on, Lebowski. Jackie Treehorn wants to see you.
And we know which Lebowski you are, Lebowski.
Yeah. Jackie Treehorn wants to talk to the deadbeat Lebowski.
Manolo will load it into your car for you, uh, Dude.
Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see you again some time, Dude.
We've had some terrible news. Mr. Lebowski is in seclusion in the West Wing.
Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money.
Why me, man?
He suspects that the culprits might be the very people who, uh, soiled your rug, and you're in a unique position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm that suspicion.
So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, huh?
They called about eighty minutes ago. They want you to take the money and drive north on the 4 5. They'll call you on the portable phone with instructions in about forty minutes. One person only or I'd go with you. They were very clear on that: one person only. What happened to your jaw?
Here's the money, and the phone. Please, Dude, follow whatever instructions they give.
Uh-huh.
Her life is in your hands.
Oh, man, don't say that..
Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands.
Shit.
This is our concern, Dude.
That had not occurred to us, Dude.
Where'd she been?
Visiting friends of hers in Palm Springs. Just picked up and left, never bothered to tell us.
I know my rights.
You don't know shit, Lebowski.
I want a fucking lawyer, man. I want Bill Kunstler.
What are you, some kind of sad-assed refugee from the fucking sixties?
Uh-huh.
Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to eject you from his garden party, that you were drunk and abusive.
That guy treats women like objects, man.
A dick, man! And let me tell you something: I dig your work. Playing one side against the other--in bed with everybody--fabulous stuff, man.
I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay away from my fucking lady friend, man.
Hey hey, I'm not messing with your special lady--
She's not my special lady, she's my fucking lady friend. I'm just helping her conceive, man!
Hey, man, I'm not--
Who're you working for? Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn?
The Gundersons.
The? Who the fff--
Jesus fucking Christ.
Fuck, man! That's terrible!
Yeah, it sucks.
There's no ransom if you don't have a fucking hostage. That's what ransom is. Those are the fucking rules.
Zere ARE no ROOLZ!
Okay. Vee take ze money you haf on you und vee call it eefen.
VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN! VEE TAKE YOUR MONEY!
Come and get it.
VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!
Come and get it. Fucking nihilist.
I FUCK YOU! I FUCK YOU!
NUSSING!
Excuse me?
Nothing.
Can we just rent it from you?
Sir, please lower your voice--
Hey man, don't you have something else you could put it in?
Yeah.
What's this?
That is for the urn.
Don't need it. We're scattering the ashes.
Yes, so we were informed. However, we must of course transmit the remains to you in a receptacle.
This is a hundred and eighty dollars.
They range up to three thousand.
What the fuck is he talking about?
Fuckin' A.
His name is Lebowski? That's your name, Dude!
What do you mean, Dude?
Yeah.
Yeah, well, what do you care, Walter?
Sheesh.
Where you going, Dude?
I'm going home, Donny.
Your phone's ringing, Dude.
Almost five!
What tied the room together, Dude?
Were you listening to the story, Donny?
What--
Were you listening to the Dude's story?
I was bowling--
Yeah Walter, what's your point?
He peed on the Dude's rug--
What's a pederast, Walter?
If what's during league play?
Life does not stop and start at your convenience, you miserable piece of shit.
I am the Walrus.
Shut the fuck up, Donny! V.I. Lenin! Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!
What the fuck is he talking about?
They posted the next round of the tournament--
Donny, shut the f--when do we play?
This Saturday. Quintana and--
Burkhalter.
I told that kraut a fucking thousand times I don't roll on shabbas.
It's already posted.
How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter?
I'm shomer shabbas.
Oh yeah, how'd it go?
Kill that poor woman.
Walter, if you can't ride in a car, how d'you get around on Shammas--
Who has your undies, Walter?
And then they're gonna stamp on it?!
Fucking Germans. Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.
They were Nazis, Dude?
Come on, Donny, they were threatening castration!
Uh-huh.
Are you gonna split hairs?
No--
Am I wrong?
What do you need that for, Dude?
Those are good burgers, Walter.
What have you. We'll, uh--
We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.
Who's in pyjamas, Walter?
Are they gonna hurt us, Walter?
--So he says, "My son can't hold a job, my daughter's married to a fuckin' loser, and I got a rash on my ass so bad I can't hardly siddown. But you know me. I can't complain."
Jesus, man, can you change the station?
Fuck you man! You don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab!
I've had a--
I pull over and kick your ass out, man!
--had a rough night, and I hate the fucking Eagles, man--
And this is the study. You can see the various commendations, honorary degrees, et cetera.
Yes, uh, very impressive.
Please, feel free to inspect them.
I'm not really, uh.
Please! Please!
That's the key to the city of Pasadena, which Mr. Lebowski was given two years ago in recognition of his various civic, uh.
Uh-huh.
That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given--not necessarily given every year! Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially--
Hey, is this him with Nancy?
That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the first lady, yes, taken when--
Lebowski on the right?
Of course, Mr. Lebowski on the right, Mrs. Reagan on the left, taken when--
He's handicapped, huh?
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes. And this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes? Not of California.
Far out.
And in fact he met privately with the President, though unfortunately there wasn't time for a photo opportunity.
Nancy's pretty good.
Wonderful woman. We were very--
Are these.
These are Mr. Lebowski's children, so to speak--
Different mothers, huh?
No, they--
I guess he's pretty, uh, racially pretty cool--
They're not his, heh-heh, they're not literally his children; they're the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, inner-city children of promise but without the--
I see.
--without the means for higher education, so Mr. Lebowski has committed to sending all of them to college.
Jeez. Think he's got room for one more?
One--oh! Heh-heh. You never went to college?
Well, yeah I did, but I spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings--
Heh-heh--
--smoking thai-stick, breaking into the ROTC--
Yes, heh--
1972 Pontiac LeBaron.
Color?
Green. Some brown, or, uh, rust, coloration.
And was there anything of value in the car?
Huh? Oh. Yeah. Tape deck. Couple of Creedence tapes. And there was a, uh. . . my briefcase.
In the briefcase?
Papers. Just papers. You know, my papers. Business papers.
And what do you do, sir?
...Me, I don't drink coffee. But it's nice when they offer.
...Also, my rug was stolen.
No. Here.
Sometimes. I wouldn't hold out much hope for the tape deck though. Or the Creedence tapes.
Ahh, not so good, man.
One a those days, huh. Wal, a wiser fella than m'self once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, wal, he eats you.
Uh-huh. That some kind of Eastern thing?
Far from it.
I like your style, Dude.
Well I like your style too, man. Got a whole cowboy thing goin'.
Take it easy, Dude.
Howdy do, Dude.
Oh, hey man, how are ya? I wondered if I'd see you again.
Wouldn't miss the semis. How things been goin'?
Thanks, Gary...Take care, man, I gotta get back.
Sure. Take it easy, Dude--I know that you will.
This is quite a pad you got here, man. Completely unspoiled.
What's your drink, Dude?
White Russian, thanks. How's the smut business, Jackie?
I wouldn't know, Dude. I deal in publishing, entertainment, political advocacy, and--
Which one was Logjammin'?
People forget that the brain is the biggest erogenous zone--
Of course, you do get the good with the bad. The new technology permits us to do exciting things with interactive erotic software. Wave of the future, Dude. 100% electronic.
Uh-huh. Well, I still jerk off manually.
Of course you do. I can see you're anxious for me to get to the point. Well Dude, here it is. Where's Bunny?
I thought you might know, man.
Me? How would I know? The only reason she ran off was to get away from her rather sizable debt to me.
I've heard the kidnapping story, so save it. I know you're mixed up in all this, Dude, and I don't care what you're trying to take off her husband. That's your business. All I'm saying is, I want mine.
Yeah, well, right man, there are many facets to this, uh, you know, many interested parties. If I can find your money, man-- what's in it for the Dude?
Of course, there's that to discuss. Refill?
Does the Pope shit in the woods?
Let's say a 10% finder's fee?
No! No! NO! THAT'S NOT--
Who the fuck are you, man! Come on, man!
Relax, man! No physical harm intended!
Who the fuck are you? Why've you been following me? Come on, fuckhead!
Brother Shamus? Like an Irish monk?
Irish m--What the fuck are you talking about? My name's Da Fino! I'm a private snoop! Like you, man!
Hello, gentlemen. You are the bereaved?
Yeah man.
Francis Donnelly. Pleased to meet you.
Is that what that's a picture of?
In a sense, yes. Elfranco, my robe. My art has been commended as being strongly vaginal. Which bothers some men. The word itself makes some men uncomfortable. Vagina.
Oh yeah?
Yes, they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say. Whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or his "Johnson".
"Johnson"?
Huh?
Yes, I know about it. And I know that you acted as courier. And let me tell you something: the whole thing stinks to high heaven.
Right, but let me explain something about that rug--
Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?
Excuse me?
Sex. The physical act of love. Coitus. Do you like it?
I was talking about my rug.
You're not interested in sex?
You mean coitus?
I like it too. It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy.
Oh, no.
Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word. Our mutual acquaintance Bunny is one of these.
Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but I don't see what it has to do with--do you have any kalhua?
Lord. You can imagine where it goes from here.
He fixes the cable?
Shit yeah, the achievers.
Yeah, but my-
I'm getting to your rug. My father and I don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, I don't approve of his. Still, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so I'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to.
Well--sure, I could do that--
If you successfully do so, I will compensate you to the tune of 1% of the recovered sum.
A hundred.
Thousand, yes, bones or clams or whatever you call them.
Yeah, but what about--
Oh that's okay, I hardly even--
Here's the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you. You will receive no bill. He's a good man, and thorough.
That's really thoughtful but I--
Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the doctor.
No it's fine, really, uh--
Do you have any news regarding my father's money?
I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta respecfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all.
She most certainly was not!
Hey man, why don't you fucking listen occasionally? You might learn something. Now I got--
And please don't call her my mother.
Now I got--
She is most definitely the perpetrator and not the victim.
I'm telling you, I got definitive evidence--
From who?
The main guy, Dieter--
Dieter Hauff?
Well--yeah, I guess--
Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?
Beaver? You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him?
Roy Orbison. . . Pink Floyd.
Jeez. I miss vinyl.
Is he pretending to be the abductor?
Well...yeah--
Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with. You can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.
Well yeah...I know that.
So Dieter has the money?
Well, no, not exactly. It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins. Lotta outs. And a lotta strands to keep in my head, man. Lotta strands in old Duder's--
Do you still have that doctor's number?
Please Jeffrey. I don't want to be responsible for any delayed after- effects.
Delayed after-eff--
Jeffrey.
Tell me a little about yourself, Jeffrey.
I was, uh, one of the authors of the Port Huron Statement.--The original Port Huron Statement.
Uh-huh.
Not the compromised second draft. And then I, uh. . . Ever hear of the Seattle Seven?
And then. . . let's see, I uh--music business briefly.
Oh?
Yeah. Roadie for Metallica. Speed of Sound Tour.
Uh-huh.
Bunch of assholes. And then, you know, little of this, little of that. My career's, uh, slowed down a bit lately.
What do you do for fun?
What happened to your house?
Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee.
Finder's fee?
He thought I had your father's money, so he got me out of the way while he looked for it.
It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's. Why did he think you had it? And who does?
Jeffrey--
It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs. Fortunately I've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber. I'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close. It's just--
I keep telling you, it's the Foundation's money. Father doesn't have any.
Huh? He's fucking loaded.
No no, the wealth was all Mother's.
But your father--he runs stuff, he--
We did let Father run one of the companies, briefly, but he didn't do very well at it.
But he's--
He helps administer the charities now, and I give him a reasonable allowance. He has no money of his own. I know how he likes to present himself; Father's weakness is vanity. Hence the slut.
Increases?
Well yes, what did you think this was all about? Fun and games?
Well...no, of course not--
I want a child.
Yeah, okay, but see, the Dude--
Look, Jeffrey, I don't want a partner. In fact I don't want the father to be someone I have to see socially, or who'll have any interest in rearing the child himself.
So...that doctor.
No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu. A real reactionary. . . So your father. . . Oh man, I get it!
This was, uh--
Yeah man, it really tied the room together--
What's your point, Walter?
What's the point of--we all know who was at fault, so what the fuck are you talking about?
Forget it, Donny. You're out of your element.
This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about?
What the fuck are you talking about?! This Chinaman is not the issue! I'm talking about drawing a line in the sand, Dude. Across this line you do not, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is not the preferred, uh. . . Asian- American. Please.
Walter, this is not a guy who built the rail- roads, here, this is a guy who peed on my--
What the fuck are you--
So who--
Jeff Lebowski. Come on. This other Jeffrey Lebowski. The millionaire. He's gonna be easier to find anyway than these two, uh. these two . . . And he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no FUCKING reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug. Am I wrong?
No, but--
Am I wrong!
Yeah, but--
Donny! Please!
Way to go, Dude. If you will it, it is no dream.
You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
Theodore Herzel.
Huh?
State of Israel. If you will it, Dude, it is no--
What the fuck're you talking about? The carrier. What's in the fucking carrier?
Huh? Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian. Can't leave him home alone or he eats the furniture.
What the fuck are you--
I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian. I'm looking after it while Cynthia and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.
You brought a fucking Pomeranian bowling?
Hey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked me to take care of her fucking dog while she and her boyfriend went to Honolulu, I'd tell her to go fuck herself. Why can't she board it?
First of all, Dude, you don't have an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show dog with fucking papers. You can't board it. It gets upset, its hair falls out.
Hey man--
Come on Walter, it's just--it's Smokey. So his toe slipped over a little, it's just a game.
Smokey my friend, you're entering a world of pain.
Hey Walter--
Walter, they're calling the cops, put the piece away.
Walter, you can't do that. These guys're like me, they're pacificists. Smokey was a conscientious objector.
You know Dude, I myself dabbled with pacifism at one point. Not in Nam, of course--
And you know Smokey has emotional problems!
You mean--beyond pacifism?
Huh. I did not know that. Well, it's water under the bridge. And we do enter the next round-robin, am I wrong?
No, you're not wrong--
Am I wrong!
Okay then. We play Quintana and O'Brien next week. They'll be pushovers.
Just, just take it easy, Walter.
That's your answer to everything, Dude. And let me point out--pacifism is not--look at our current situation with that camelfucker in Iraq-- pacifism is not something to hide behind.
Well, just take 't easy, man.
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
Yeah? Wavin' a gun around?!
Yeah, but he's a fucking pervert, Dude.
Huh?
Huh.
Anyway. How much they offer you?
Twenty grand. And of course I still keep the rug.
Just for making the hand-off?
...They gave Dude a beeper, so whenever these guys call--
What if it's during a game?
I figure it's easy money, it's all pretty harmless. I mean she probably kidnapped herself.
That...fucking...bitch!
Those rich fucks! This whole fucking thing-- I did not watch my buddies die face down in the muck so that this fucking strumpet--
I don't see any connection to Vietnam, Walter.
Well, there isn't a literal connection, Dude.
Walter, face it, there isn't any connection. It's your roll.
Have it your way. The point is--
It's your roll--
The fucking point is--
The what?
What the hell is this?
My dirty undies. Laundry, Dude. The whites.
Walter, I'm sure there's a reason you brought your dirty undies--
Thaaaat's right, Dude. The weight. The ringer can't look empty.
Walter--what the fuck are you thinking?
Well you're right, Dude, I got to thinking. I got to thinking why should we settle for a measly fucking twenty grand--
We? What the fuck we? You said you just wanted to come along--
My point, Dude, is why should we settle for twenty grand when we can keep the entire million. Am I wrong?
Yes you're wrong. This isn't a fucking game, Walter--
Oh shit. Walter.
What the fuck is going on there?
They hung up, Walter! You fucked it up! You fucked it up! Her life was in our hands!
Easy, Dude.
We're screwed now! We don't get shit and they're gonna kill her! We're fucked, Walter!
Ya see? Nothing is fucked up here, Dude. Nothing is fucked. These guys are fucking amateurs--
Shutup, Walter! Don't fucking say peep when I'm doing business here.
Yeah. So as long as we get her back, nobody's in a position to complain. And we keep the baksheesh.
Terrific, Walter. But you haven't told me how we get her back. Where is she?
...Huh?
Yeah. That's a great plan, Walter. That's fucking ingenious, if I understand it correctly. That's a Swiss fucking watch.
FUCK.
What'd he say? Where's the hand- off?
There is no fucking hand-off, Walter! At a wooden bridge we throw the money out of the car!
Huh?
We can't do that, Dude. That fucks up our plan.
Well call them up and explain it to 'em, Walter! Your plan is so fucking simple, I'm sure they'd fucking understand it! That's the beauty of it Walter!
Wooden bridge, huh?
I'm throwing the money, Walter! We're not fucking around!
The bridge is coming up! Gimme the ringer, Dude! Chop-chop!
Fuck that! I love you, Walter, but sooner or later you're gonna have to face the fact that you're a goddamn moron.
Walter!
Your wheel, Dude! I'm rolling out!
What the fuck?
Your wheel! At fifteen em-pee-aitch I roll out! I double back, grab one of 'em and beat it out of him! The uzi!
You didn't think I was rolling out of here naked!
Aitz chaim he, Dude. As the ex used to say.
What the fuck is that supposed to mean? What the fuck're we gonna tell Lebowski?
Huh? The problem is--what do you mean what's the--there's no--we didn't-- they're gonna kill that poor woman--
What the fuck're you talking about? That poor woman--that poor slut-- kidnapped herself, Dude. You said so yourself--
No, Walter! I said I thought she kidnapped herself! You're the one who's so fucking certain--
Walter, what'm I gonna tell Lebowski?
I told that fuck down at the league office-- who's in charge of scheduling?
Who gives a shit, Walter? What about that poor woman? What do we tell--
Yeah, and in the meantime what do I tell Lebowski?
That's it. I'm out of here.
But Walter, we didn't make the fucking hand- off! They didn't get, the fucking money and they're gonna-- they're gonna--
Walter--
Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?
"Our" car, Walter?
You don't know, Walter? You seem to know the answer to everything else!
Hmm. Well, we were in a handicapped spot. It, uh, it was probably towed.
It's been stolen, Walter! You fucking know it's been stolen!
Well, certainly that's a possibility, Dude--
That wasn't her toe.
Whose toe was it, Walter?
How the fuck should I know? I do know that nothing about it indicates--
The nail polish, Walter.
Fine, Dude. As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe--
Someone else's--where the fuck are they gonna--
You want a toe? I can get you a toe, believe me. There are ways, Dude. You don't wanna know about it, believe me.
But Walter--
I'll get you a toe by this afternoon--with nail polish. These fucking amateurs. They send us a toe, we're supposed to shit our- selves with fear. Jesus Christ. My point is--
They're gonna kill her, Walter, and then they're gonna kill me--
Well that's just, that's the stress talking, Dude. So far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes--
What about the toe?
Lady, I got buddies who died face- down in the muck so you and I could enjoy this family restaurant!
All right, I'm leaving. I'm sorry ma'am.
I figure my only hope is that the big Lebowski kills me before the Germans can cut my dick off.
Now that is ridiculous, Dude. No one is going to cut your dick off.
Thanks Walter.
Not if I have anything to say about it.
Yeah, thanks Walter. That gives me a very secure feeling.
Dude--
That makes me feel all warm inside.
Now Dude--
They're nihilists.
Huh?
They kept saying they believe in nothing.
Yeah.
And let's also not forget--let's not forget, Dude--that keeping wildlife, an amphibious rodent, for uh, domestic, you know, within the city-- that isn't legal either.
What're you, a fucking park ranger now?
No, I'm--
Who gives a shit about the fucking marmot!
--We're sympathizing here, Dude--
He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--
The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
Who the fuck is that?
Huh?
Who the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers?
Who the f--have you ever heard of a little show called Branded, Dude?
Yeah.
All but one man died? There at Bitter Creek?
Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show Walter, so what?
Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote 156 episodes, Dude.
Uh-huh.
The bulk of the series.
Uh-huh.
Not exactly a lightweight.
No.
And yet his son is a fucking dunce.
Uh.
Fuck me, man! That kid's already spent all the money!
Is this your homework, Larry?
Look, man, did you--
Dude, please!. . . Is this your homework, Larry?
Is this yours, Larry? Is this your homework, Larry?
Is the car out front yours?
Is this your homework, Larry?
Look, Larry. . . Have you ever heard of Vietnam?
Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!
You're going to enter a world of pain, son. We know that this is your homework. We know you stole a car--
And the fucking money!
Walter, if you're there, pick up the fucking phone. Pick it up, Walter, this is an emergency. I'm not--
Dude?
Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I need you to come pick me up--
I can't drive, Dude, it's erev shabbas.
Huh?
Erev shabbas. I can't drive. I'm not even supposed to pick up the phone, unless it's an emergency.
It is a fucking emergency.
I understand. That's why I picked up the phone.
THEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind, just call Donny then, and ask him to--
Dude, I'm not supposed to make calls--
I mean we totally fucked it up, man. We fucked up his pay-off. And got the kidnappers all pissed off, and the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot, but he didn't do anything. Huh?
Well it's, sometimes the cathartic, uh.
I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck- up, then why does he still leave me in charge of getting back his wife? Because he fucking doesn't want her back, man! He's had enough! He no longer digs her! It's all a show! But then, why didn't he give a shit about his million bucks? I mean, he knew we didn't hand off his
What's your point, Dude?
His million bucks was never in it, man! There was no money in that briefcase! He was hoping they'd kill her! You throw out a ringer for a ringer!
Yeah?
Shit yeah!
Okay, but how does all this add up to an emergency?
Huh?
I'm saying, I see what you're getting at, Dude, he kept the money, but my point is, here we are, it's shabbas, the sabbath, which I'm allowed to break only if it's a matter of life and death--
Walter, come off it. You're not even fucking Jewish, you're--
What the fuck are you talking about?
You're fucking Polish Catholic--
What the fuck are you talking about? I converted when I married Cynthia! Come on, Dude!
Yeah, and you were--
You know this!
And you were divorced five fucking years ago.
Yeah? What do you think happens when you get divorced? You turn in your library card? Get a new driver's license? Stop being Jewish?
This driveway.
I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye
It's just part of your whole sick Cynthia thing. Taking care of her fucking dog. Going to her fucking synagogue. You're living in the fucking past.
AS IF WE WOULD EVER DREAM OF TAKING YOUR BULLSHIT MONEY!
It's all over, man! We call your fucking bluff!
WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE! HE'S CRIPPLED! PUT HIM DOWN!
Oh, shit.
He can't walk, Walter!
Walter, you fuck!
Shit, Dude, I didn't know. I wouldn't've done it if I knew he was a fucking crybaby.
Sure you'll see some tank battles. But fighting in desert is very different from fighting in canopy jungle.
Uh-huh.
I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war whereas, uh, this thing should be a fucking cakewalk. I mean I had an M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking tank. Just me and Charlie, man, eyeball to eyeball.
Yeah.
Fuck you. Fuck the three of you.
Hey, cool it Walter. Listen, pal, there never was any money. The big Lebowski gave me an empty briefcase, man, so take it up with him.
What's mine is mine.
Hy God! They shot him, Walter!
No Dude.
There weren't any shots.
Then what's...
It's a heart attack.
Wha.
Call the medics, Dude.
Wha. . . Donny--
Walter Sobchak.
Well can we--
We're scattering the fucking ashes!
Walter--
Goddamnit Walter! You fucking asshole!
You make everything a fucking travesty!
What about that shit about Vietnam!
Dude, I'm sorry--
Shit Dude, I'm sorry--
WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD!
Dude, this is Smokey. Look, I don't wanna be a hard-on about this, and I know it wasn't your fault, but I just thought it was fair to tell you that Gene and I will be submitting this to the League and asking them to set aside the round. Or maybe forfeit it to us--
Shit!
Dude here.
Who is this?
Dude the Bagman. Where do you want us to go?
Shut the fuck up. Hello?
Yeah?
Dude here.
Okay, vee proceed. But only if there is no funny stuff.
Yeah.
So no funny stuff. Okay?
Dude.
Another Caucasian, Gary.
Right, Dude.
Huh? No, she, she hit me right here.
Well sir, it's this rug I have, really tied the room together-
You told Brandt on the phone, he told me. So where do I fit in?
Well they were looking for you, these two guys, they were trying to--
I'll say it again, all right? You told Brandt. He told me. I know what happened. Yes? Yes?
So you know they were trying to piss on your rug--
Did I urinate on your rug?
You mean, did you personally come and pee on my--
Hello! Do you speak English? Parla usted Inglese? I'll say it again. Did I urinate on your rug?
Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug--
Hello! Hello! So every time--I just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the--
Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam anybody here, I'm just--
You're just looking for a handout like every other--are you employed, Mr. Lebowski?
Look, let me explain something. I'm not Mr. Lebowski; you're Mr. Lebowski. I'm the Dude. So that's what you call me. That, or Duder. His Dudeness. Or El Duderino, if, you know, you're not into the whole brevity thing--
Are you employed, sir?
Employed?
You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday.
Is this a--what day is this?
But I do work, so if you don't mind--
No, look. I do mind. The Dude minds. This will not stand, ya know, this will not stand, man. I mean, if your wife owes--
Ah fuck it.
It's funny. I can look back on a life of achievement, on challenges met, competitors bested, obstacles overcome. I've accomplished more than most men, and without the use of my legs. What. . . What makes a man, Mr. Lebowski?
Dude.
Huh?
I don't know, sir.
Is it. . . is it, being prepared to do the right thing? Whatever the price? Isn't that what makes a man?
Mind if I smoke a jay?
'Scuse me?
Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light of my life. Are you surprised at my tears, sir?
Fuckin' A.
Where's my goddamn money, you bum?!
Well we--I don't--
C'mon man, who're you gonna believe? Those guys are--we dropped off the damn money--
WHAT?!
I--the royal we, you know, the editorial--I dropped off the money, exactly as per--Look, I've got certain information, certain things have come to light, and uh, has it ever occurred to you, man, that given the nature of all this new shit, that, uh, instead of running around blaming me, that this whole thing might just be, not, you know, not just such a
What in God's holy name are you blathering about?
Well sure, look at it! Young trophy wife, I mean, in the parlance of our times, owes money all over town, including to known pornographers-- and that's cool, that's cool-- but I'm saying, she needs money, and of course they're gonna say they didn't get it 'cause she wants more, man, she's gotta feed the monkey, I mean-- hasn't that ever occurred to you...?
Brandt, give him the envelope.
Well, she's back. No thanks to you.
We know the briefcase was empty, man. We know you kept the million bucks yourself.
Well? Aren't you?
Well. . . yeah.
Put me down, you son of a bitch!
You monsters!
Who the hell is he?
Look at that fucking phony, Dude! Pretending to be a fucking millionaire!
I said out. Now.
This guy fucking walks. I've never been more certain of anything in my life!
Oh, shit.
Shit, sorry man.
Smokey Huh?
Over the line, Smokey! I'm sorry. That's a foul.
Bullshit. Eight, Dude.
Excuse me! Mark it zero. Next frame.
Bullshit. Walter!
Yeah, but--
Am I wrong!?
I'm not--
Walter--
YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE? MARK IT ZERO!!
You happy, you crazy fuck?
You come all the way down here to roust--
Tom here's my ninth hard felon of the month. Six weeks he'll be sucking gas. In three years I'll be working Central Warrants. Jewboy Deputy D.A. over there wets his pants for fighters. Promised me the next spot he can wangle.
Impressive.
Whatta we do about the Mex?
We'll take 'em in the morning.
<i>You'll</i> take him.
He's half yours, partner.
He's all yours. And I'm not your partner.
What?
Why?
Seems like he's doing me a favor, then.
Two years.
Then they weren't created to go after your "patient zero".
You've been training two years to take me out. Here I am, the big, bad vampire hunter. So do it.
What the hell are you doing, Blade?
Where to first?
This is our world you're entering. You may see things -- feeding. Just remember why you're here.
What is it with you people and pain?
What was that?
You're hurt.
I'll heal.
What about Nomak?
He escaped. You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.
how long since he was bitten?
Recognize him?
From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank. He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked.
Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.
Right. So why is he dying? He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
No hemoglobin left. Their metabolisms are too fast. They burn out. That's why they're having to feed so often. Their systems are self destructing.
If that's true, what about Nomak? He's been alive longer than the others.
I've never seen anything like this. The Reapers are as different from us as we are from you. It's almost as if the virus is re-wiring their bodies, creating new, parasitic organs which consume the old ones.
Like cancer with a purpose.
He's right about one thing. We do have to survive.
You don't have to hunt to do it.
Blade. We've got six Reapers. They're all dead.
Blade.
Each day is a little life.
What?
Anyone else make it?
Thank you.
For what?
It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't.
You don't want to go there.
Why?
Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
It doesn't have to be like that. We don't have to be enemies.
Get real. I was useful to Damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on. Now that it's over, all bets are off.
Why do you hate us so much?
I am a hunter. A weapon. It's what I do. It's in my blood.
You're hurting me.
It means "bloodbrother."
How does it look?
What do you want me to do?
How do you feel?
You came back for me.
Did you think I wouldn't?
Let's just hope you've kicked the Thirst for good. I'll be watching you close. You start to back-slide --
I agree. We play along for now, we might wind up learning something about how their world ticks.
What do you think?
Sounds like a plan.
What do you really think?
He's right. They'll smell that you're human. Stay here, watch our backs.
I don't like it.
I thought you were supposed to be watching our backs.
Where were you, Whistler?
You ask me, you and Miss Muffet are getting a mite too cozy for my taste.
I am worrying. Seems to me, you're starting to get confused as to which side of the line you're standing on.
Pretty hollow words coming from a man who spent the last year running with the enemy.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Eau de suckhead. Tasty.
Your security's for shit, kid.
Where the hell have you been?
What's your problem, Whistler?
I did some checking on that Carter Stevens character. That familiar of theirs who claimed he was with the NIH? Turns out he used to work for them, but he doesn't anymore.
Come on, Blade. Talk to me!
And so will we.
Look, I care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it?
Spare me the race card, OJ. We're not going out into the sun. It's too risky.
Must be hundreds of these skeletons here.
So?
Put it back in park, Blade.
Thought you were dead.
It has been said, you may have enemies whom you hate, but not enemies whom you despise. Be proud of your enemy: then his success shall be yours, too. In that regard, I should thank you.
You want me to hunt them for you.
The genetic material you spliced into Nomak -- Where did you get it?
True, but thanks to you, we know his weakness. We can keep him contained. It's just a matter of time before we hunt him down.
And why is that?
You got something in mind, Blade?
Gonna try and OD Whistler on a retroviral cure.
Motion sensors. Looks like Zone Three.
So you're going to do this?
What's going on?
He was here. Watching us.
Nomak?
Kiss your ass goodbye, Reinhardt.
So that's down and dirty. Got anything to say for yourself?
Hey, hey! The fuck you doing?!
Getting your attention, Paco.
Oh yeah? Like how little? In case you hadn't noticed, we lost two men while you were out farting around.
Listen, hillbilly, you are a cunt-hair away from cowboy heaven.
We want to attract them, not scare them off.
What the fuck you doing?
His name is Jared Nomak.
I would hate to think you were losing your perspective. Who do you think God favors in the web? The spider or the fly?
Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato. Where did he learn that?
From his father, of course.
We're locked in.
Are you insane? He'll kill us both!
Yes?
They've made contact with the Reapers.
Any casualties?
An inevitability, I suppose. Nyssa was not among them, I trust.
No. This is a dangerous game, you're playing, Damaskinos.
You worry too much, Stevens. I have assurance from our friend inside that events are unfolding as scripted.
I see from your questionnaire that you don't have any immediate next of kin?
Not that I'm in contact with.
Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
No -- Does that mean I can't be a donor?
Your blood has a very rare phenotype, one that's quite valuable to people like us.
Tell me something, Skid --
Scud.
Whatever -- What'd you do to the Charger?
The pimp-mobile? Just made a few after market modifications. Nitrous-oxide injection system, forged aluminum pistons and crankshaft, higher flowing fuel pump.
Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
Fuck yeah. Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
Where'd you dig up this shit-bird anyway?
Hey, you think I don't know what's at stake here? We practically compromised our whole operation to save your puckered old ass! And for what?
This whole deal's giving me a serious case of the butt-willies.
The hell are you fiddling with there?
Tweaked the phosphor rod, modified the collimated beam, wanna concentrate the light, get something like a UV laser going.
You're wasting your time, already been tried.
Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it, did you?
Nope. Back then we did not.
So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
Going on twenty years now.
Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
Pretty.
What about you? You're not coming?
Yeah, your little cootchie knew.
You little shit. When did they get to you?
Whistler!
She's been bitten.
You should've killed her, then.
I had to increase the dose. You're building up a resistance to the serum --
Stupidity.
Maybe not. I did some checking, she's a hematologist. Knowledge like that might come in handy.
Get in. Youre leaving.
What took you so long?
Going somewhere?
Don't try to talk --
Listen. You have to -- finish me off. You don't want me coming back.
Whistler, I --
Beautiful day, isn't it?
How can you be out here?
It's not very effective in direct sunlight, but it's a start. The goal, of course, is to be like you, "the Day-walker".
I don't buy it.
Why not? The future of our race runs through your bloodstream. You've got the best of both worlds, Blade. All of our strengths and none of our weaknesses.
Maybe I don't see it that way.
Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
You're wrong.
The pause that refreshes -- Care for some? Smells good, doesn't it? Pungent, with just an irrepressible hint of iron.
Pass.
You're not going anywhere.
No longer.
Who dies first?
Guess you're not quite as invulnerable as you thought.
You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and my transition will be complete. Even your sword won't be able to affect me then.
You're too human, Blade.
Is something wrong, my friend?
You're blind --
Hold out your hands.
I didn't come here to get my palms read. I need something translated.
This is an old tongue, from an old world. It concerns LaMagra.
Who is LaMagra?
The Day Walker's blood is a disparador -- a trigger, you see? For LaMagra's return. One need only consume it and the spirit of his ancestors will settle upon him. "And the Sleeper will rise from the shadows anew, cleansing the world in a Tide of Blood."
"The Blood Tide".
Yes. The vampire apocalypse. It is said that all who feel its taint will succumb to the Thirst.
I am tired. Dawn is coming.
But I just got here --
You shouldn't be here.
-- he's a vampire.
Why?
Because you're tainted. The venom's still inside you. You could still turn on us.
And you honestly expect me to believe all this?
I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business.
I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career --
I can go to the police. I have blood samples back at the hospital. I can show them.
Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint.
How did you know?
Figured they'd send someone after you. Thought I'd wait around and see who showed up.
You used me as bait?!
It worked, didn't it?
But, he could've --
But he's a policeman --
That's a glyph, kind of like a vampire cattle brand. That means Officer Friendly here is someone's property. Any of the other vampire's try to bleed him, they'll have to answer to Friendly's owner -- This glyph belongs to Deacon Frost. We've been tracking him for a while now --
Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them?
Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.
And that's a good thing?
What are you doing?!
You can't do this, he's human, it's murder.
Look, if what you say is true, if there's a chance I could turn into one of them, then I've got no choice, do I? I have to work with you. I need to learn everything I can about them. It's the only way I'll be able to find a cure for myself.
There is no cure.
What are you looking at?
What do you see here?
Graffiti --
I know this place -- it's a blood bank.
You let him go -- An hour ago you were ready to kill a man for less, this one didn't even talk.
Looks like we hit pay-dirt. This place is crawling with them. See the valets over there? They're vampires. So is the doorman.
How can you tell?
So many of them -- I still can't believe they're real.
There are worse things than vampires out there.
Like what?
What is this place?
Some kind of archive --
Isn't this all a little high-tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins.
You're hurt --
What am I injecting you with?
It's dark in here.
I can't close my eyes without hearing her scream.
Those aren't real memories. No one has that kind of recall.
I do. I remember from day one. People staring at me, sensing I was different. Watching the fear grow in their eyes, knowing in their hearts I wasn't human.
Just get out of here.
I made a trip to the hospital last night, borrowed some equipment.
Is he sick?
You care about him, don't you?
My mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart.
Any progress?
Some. It's been slow --
You don't look so good.
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.
Are you all right?
I've been better --
How long have we been driving?
Is it bad?
It won't work on you.
Get out of here --
I'm not leaving without you.
-- tearing me -- apart.
I know. Take some of my blood.
No --
I can't -- I won't be able to stop --
I never imagined I'd be so happy to see the sun rise -- It's over, isn't it?
How's it going, Kam?
You're a week early.
Whistler says I'm building up a resistance to it.
I was afraid that might happen.
Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.
But you -- died --
Deacon brought me back.
Please --
How could you be a part of this?
These are my people now. I'm one of them.
You don't have to be.
I wish you could see the world as I do. Deacon opened my eyes. There's no turning back from that.
I don't believe that.
This isn't human blood.
Then what is it?
The red blood cells are biconvex, which is theoretically impossible. They're hypochromic, there's virtually no hemoglobin in them. Look at the PMNs, they're binucleated, they should be mononucleated.
Curtis, it's three in the morning. I'm really not in the mood for one of your practical jokes.
It's not a joke. I've got the stiff sitting in the morgue right now -- look, just come up and see him, okay? Five minutes, that's all I ask.
I thought you promised to give me some distance?
Five minutes, not a second more. And I don't want to hear a word about "us".
You haven't started in on the internal organs?
That's weird --
What?
Tell me something, honestly, you ever have second thoughts about us?
-- but then I remember what an ass-hole you were and I'm snapped back to reality.
Blade. Once again, our interests have fallen victim to his ridiculous crusade. He must be destroyed.
The Day Walker represents a unique opportunity. We'd be fools to waste it by killing him.
Deacon Frost. You refuse to speak our language, you insult the House of Erebus by using the humans' gutter-tongue, have you no respect for tradition?
I see. And what would you have us do with this "half-breed"?
Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for.
The shadows suit us, Frost. We've existed this way for thousands of years. Who are you to challenge our ways?
These archives are restricted to members of the House of Erebus.
Please. You and the other Elders wouldn't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it. Which, of course, they do.
You're wasting your time, Frost. Far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever secrets they hold have been lost.
How do you like that? Right on time.
How many of you are there?
A few thousand scattered about the globe. In the past, we've had to restrict our numbers for fear of discovery. That won't be necessary after tonight.
What happens then?
The Blood Tide. Our long-prophesied holy war against the humans. There's a force, you see -- a spirit that exists in our blood. I've discovered a way to invoke it.
LaMagra --
LaMagra isn't a physical being. He's a spirit, requiring a flesh and blood host in order to manifest himself.
You.
There's no need for any of this. Your condition can be treated. Whistler and I were working on a cure when --
What makes you think we want to be cured? Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt, the killing, that's what the Thirst is really about.
But you use blood banks --
You're a monster.
Blade --
I was wrong about you, Blade. You were never one of us. You're a traitor to your race.
What -- ?
Who are you people?
So what do you use, then? A stake?
Consider it a parting gift. Vampire mace -- silver nitrate, essence of garlic.
So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
We keep in radio contact.
You've been listening in the whole time?
Whistler!
Why didn't you tell me the truth about him?
Blade's unique, you know. A one in a billion anomaly. He can withstand sunlight, garlic, even silver. But he still has the Thirst.
What happens if he doesn't take the serum?
The Thirst overcomes him, just like the others. It's not something he can control. The problem is, time's running out. His body's starting to reject the serum. And so far, all my efforts to find a cure have ended in failure --
No offense, Whistler, but you're not exactly working with state of the art equipment here. You might have missed something.
Why do you hunt them?
I had a family once -- a wife, three daughters. Then a drifter named Deacon Frost came calling one evening --
He killed them?
How did you escape?
And now you're using Blade to exact your revenge?
I wouldn't go in there if I were you. It's best to leave him alone when he's like this.
All right, let's start with the basics -- why do vampires need to drink blood?
Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin.
Basically you'd have to re-write the victim's DNA, alter it so that the DNA will produce proteins capable of generating hemoglobin.
How?
On me, yes. On Blade, I'm not so sure -- The problem is, Blade didn't contract the vampire virus from a bite like I did. He was born with it. The irony is, I could probably cure every vampire but him.
What happened to the power?
--and if she ever did--
--or incredibly fucking naive.
Why don't you just cut it down and count the goddamn rings--who <u>cares</u>?
'Give you a hand. I think my sleep for the night just ended.
I need you to talk to me, talk to me about the dreams--about James, the other boys.
I don't...I don't understand them myself.
Try, please, Anna--
--bad boys, mean boys, <u>cowardly</u> boys--just like Domini.
What do you mean?
A coward too. That's why she had to go.
What happened to her, where did she go?
Don't know--just that she was afraid--
What, are you alright?
Not that I can see.
No.
You killed Domini, didn't you, witch??
--Jamie Kurth, Jonathan Edmunds--
Please! Please...? I haven't done anything.
Bullshit! Talk!
Domini?
Yes.
What're you doing there?
Trying to find the energy.
Inside the grave?
Her father's Sheriff of Taos County.
--stop it! Stop talking about it! I'm gonna freak!
Why?
Any number of reasons--pick one, it's as good as the other.
I was out hiking, camping the past two days--that's what did it--<u>I</u> killed it--
--doubtful, Mrs. Leavitt. The main thing to remember is, whatever the reason, it was for the best-- it meant something was wrong.
Something was wrong.
Look, this is not my field of expertise. You seem stabilized, but why take any chances? Let's keep you overnight and have the Staff obstetrician do a follow-up tomorrow.
No!
Mrs. Leavitt--
--I'm not staying here!
Let's talk to your husband--
Shit? This is from "Josh's Blair Witch Mix," man!
Down or off--you're giving me a migraine.
Just trying to set the mood for the mission--get the "feeling."
The bitched-out babe in back here is one Anna Tassio--we met one dark and stormy night in a Blair Witch chat room, we all did--
--Christ almighty--
--but she was nicer then--sweeter-- she hadn't vomited twice already like today--
--it's called "morning sickness," asshole--
'Thought those all got stolen.
Guess they thought it was safe to put some up again.
Why are we here?
She e-mailed me yesterday this is where we should meet her.
What's she look like?
--how old?
I dunno, probably right up there, based on her resume.
"The Voiiiiices made him do it."
Where they found the backpacks and all the film a year later.
Oak?
Yeah, so?
This is funny?? This is tens of thousands of fucking dollars! You pricks! I'll see you in fucking court!!
--nothing left to play 'em on, honey.
Oh, sorry, right.
You can be goddamn sure, though, I'm going to be looking at every second of 'em when I get back to Baltimore--I get proof who stole my shit and I call the cops!
Druid Hill Park.
That's a joke?
Looks like business is booming.
--the witch kills children--
Hang you like the witch you are, unless--
Cheery little place.
Whatzername--the "psychic" Anna hired.
So says her website.
Jesus.
What?
No, the kids were actors, the townspeople were real. Her, the Sheriff, the Convenience Store guy--
--<u>myth</u>--
--doesn't just pop out of thin air. It spins off of real events. At some point there <u>was</u> a Blair Witch--
No.
You sure?
--chalked just hours ago by ancient adolescents. It's called vandalism.
That's a sapling--<u>this</u> mother's got to be three hundred years old, minimum.
It's a <u>sketch</u>, Anna--it's not to- scale cartography; the tree was not the kids' focus--
--do you <u>agree</u> it's that <u>old</u>, Nick?
--brother of Rustin Parr's maternal grandfather, somewhere after 1858--
--<u>whoever</u>--they built an entire house <u>around</u> a <u>tree</u>. Sticking up right through the living room. Somebody like to explain that to me?
The rest of the family was crazy as Rusty Parr.
Oh, <u>c'mon</u>--even you have to admit this is weird.
Your parents didn't have a <u>bigger</u> one?
It was <u>free</u>--I recall that was the chief selling point for you.
No offense, sweetheart: fuck you.
You know, Nick, you've been something of a total asshole the past few days.
Pardon me, I've had a few things on my mind--like putting this safari together.
Like how weirded-out you are with this pregnancy thing.
Let's just leave it at: it was one hell of a surprise.
You don't want it though.
Your body, your call.
Why is there no "our" here?
Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?
You feel no need to get married or anything.
Anna--
What?
You said the name "James."
Baby names?
I don't know. Nightmare.
You want me to scooch over next to you?
--or someone--
This is a goddamn disaster. Let's just pack it up and go.
I want to see the tapes.
And what do you possibly think you're going to fucking see there?
I think we get the gist.
For once could you just sit down, shut up, and give something a <u>chance</u>?
We're leaving--case dismissed for lack of evidence. Maybe on the ride home we can figure how the fuck we're going to graduate with no thesis.
I'm not going anywhere, 'til--
--now c'mon!
We'll stay overnight, get a hotel--
What can I get you?
Nothing. I dunno--
--you should get back into bed.
Was that you laughing?
What?
Just now?
No.
Just...try and go back to sleep.
I get dreams. I don't like 'em.
What'd you dream?
Little boys. Looking up my skirt as I danced. Giggling.
I don't know what it is, but there is something <u>happening</u> here, and it's starting to scare the living shit out me, and look, I'm just <u>not</u> going to argue the point anymore--you want to stay here, stay, but I've got to get the fuck out of here, and I'm begging you to come <u>with</u> me.
I can't.
Then I'm going--
I want to see something!
Whatever you want.
The clothes--take 'em off-- I want to see every square inch--
Are you marked like this??
Why?
--like you hurt the baby--
Oh, Jesus, no--
You're gonna owe me the rest of your life, bud.
I know, I know.
Absolutely.
<u>Before</u> 5:00--
--hours before--
--Christ, they find out I let you have it for the weekend--
<u>This</u> is what you wanted enhanced?
Yeah.
You mind me asking: why the fuck?
The, uh, blur there.
I know you're in there, you piece of shit!
You have to go.
Not until I get that Beta Cam back! We're both in a world of shit here!!
I can't.
It's my fucking <u>job</u>, man!!
You want a hand?
Beer and weed is what I've got.
So, I hear you're from New Mexico!
--last thing I remember were those four clowns shooting the movie--
<u>One</u> set. Everything from midnight on--
How'd you know they were--
--hunch. Just sort've saw 'em there.
My ass--you saw those four fucking baboons put 'em there!
I don't think it was them.
Oh, who did then? Blair Witch? Snatching equipment to make her own sequel?
I don't know yet.
Hey, <u>chill</u>, man--
Something happened to Anna in Burkittsville, in the woods, I don't know.
What? That made her lose the baby?
This is a little nuts.
Turn the tapes back on.
Does it hurt?
There, what? I didn't see anything.
Back it up, rewind, whatever you call it.
Okay, a blur.
Can you zoom it or something, make it real close, real big?
I'm the ebay Boy, remember? I can't exactly afford that kind of equipment.
Can't you like just divine it?
If I could do that, I'd be at the goddamn racetrack, not here.
I got a friend at a Lab. I could get the whole thing blown-up, enhanced--
--go!
So lemme see it.
The witch?
--thank you, Heather Arendt--and arend't we glad you're here--a real witch--
And let it be known--before we even get to Burkittsville--it's gonna be an eighteen thousand times better movie--for half the cost--
--which'd be about ten bucks--
You're a complete fucking idiot, aren't you?
From-the-movie-Mary-Brown, Trailer Park Bible Psycho?
I don't believe this.
I take it back--she <u>wasn't</u> an actor. She's a nutjob.
That's what Josh and Mike said.
You're not only an idiot, you're a goddamn <u>child</u>.
Nice tent.
Hadn't even opened the thing since Cub scouts.
Never would've guessed.
So where the hell am I going to sleep?
If you're looking at me, look elsewhere.
What movies?
What I never could figure about the movie?
What?
Three people: two guys, a girl-- sleeping in the same motel room, the same tent night after night.
Yeah?
No fucking.
No.
Made no sense. Scared out of their minds, and the greatest stress reliever in creation right at their fingertips. Nada.
No sense at all. I'm a little stressed.
We should be so lucky.
What're you, crazy??
Get <u>out</u> of here!
--yeah, a hand or something--
Me, too.
What about night?
Used to be a meat-packing plant. Slaughter on the ground floor-- carcasses schlepped up on this thing for dissection and grinding and--
--Cotter: shut up.
Get inside quick, they'll stop.
Too busy eating us?
Mi casa y su casa!
Su casa y shit-o hole-o.
English.
Whatta you got, telescopic vision?
Where <u>is</u> it?
I got the tape enhanced--and I managed to sleaze a photo blow-up. Jesus, he's gonna kill me when he finds out about the camera.
Where's Domini?
Fire escape??
She would've had to have a key, anyway, to lock the deadbolt behind her.
Same trees. They took Elly Kedward out to the same kind of trees.
--I look and look in the tree, all I ever see, he's always there watching, that stupid owl, over and over--
--Cotter, where can I get on-line?
Cotter?
Fucking owl!
You think it's possible the tree in the Parr foundation is the same one they tied Elly Kedward to?
Boy Kurth.
Where?
Not the place you want to announce your arrival.
How's she going to know where to--
It's <u>freezing</u>.
What the fuck--??
The moon trying to shoot down through all these trees--can make things funky--
--I saw what I saw.
Yeah. Me too.
The cart they brought Elly Kedward into the woods with--
--into the <u>Black</u> <u>Hills</u> with--200- something miles from here--
Be it still alive, James?
I'd strongly advise you to join us--
Nobody's going anywhere--
--hell, I don't think I'm ever leaving this place again--
That's a "j."
For "James?"
Who?
--f'chrissake, Heather, it's not like the two of us are gonna doze off he leaves for two seconds--
--I don't trust anybody, not even me, anymore--
--it's the "Blair Witch Cult"--a copy-- some pages from--one of them on the site must've gotten my message--
--who?
Remember....what Mary Brown said-- she could see the witch's hands on my face, her mouth sucking on mine.
Hold this.
What?
This is her equally on-the-rag boy- friend, Nick Leavitt--
--turn the camera off--
--they're from UMass, doing some kind of fucking term paper--
--Graduate Thesis--
--Cotter--
--a Wiccan--
We're not making Blair Witch II here.
Cotter?
I'm not finished.
You drive, I'll handle the video, okay?
What're you doing?
This isn't about us.
Was it <u>every</u> day or just semi- weekly you got your ass kicked as a kid?
Either way, maybe there's a book in it, and they both make a ton of money.
What?
Okay, but--
They're making "Blair Witch II," too.
No problem, just give us 'til dawn and we're gone.
<u>What</u>?
How're the cameras doing?
--and none of 'em were mine! I-am-so-fucked, I-am-so-fucked-- where the hell was everybody???
Asleep--
--what happened to the goddamn "Witch-watch??"
Cotter, I think she's right. Why would those guys go to all the trouble of stealing the camera and all this other stuff and leave the tapes?
Spite.
403 41st Street, kids: home.
I dunno it's safe to even get out of the car.
Let's get inside.
Just one lock in this neighbor- hood?
Running a junk yard.
There's four other angles, man, we haven't even--
What--
--whatever you want, no problem--
You wanna keep it down, she's trying to sleep.
Sorry, I didn't think we were making that much noise.
Well, she's got to be <u>somewhere</u> here.
How much of that stuff you guys been smoking?
Enough to keep sane.
Chrissake: why <u>any</u> of this?
It's Domini, it's not Domini, I don't care--all I know is <u>I'm</u> not dealing with something--<u>anything</u>-- snuffing me in my sleep. I want to do what we did in the woods-- surveillance of this whole place 24/7, with somebody monitoring those cameras every second. There's something, somebody here, I want to see 'em coming.
I thought all your equipment got stolen.
Just hold on!
Just let it go, I've got you!
What're you nuts--
--it's less than four feet, just--
What?
Why was <u>she</u> exempted, Nick?
Ruins of the Rustin Parr house.
What is all this shit?
We're doing dusk-till-dawn taping of all the places where there've been alleged Blair Witch "sightings" --the Parr House, Coffin Rock, Tappy Creek.
Why?
She got <u>paid</u>.
Look at those marks--just like in the movie.
--sacred and occult Scotch Tape.
Oooh. Oooh.
Ah, Domini?
What?
You planning on sleeping out there?
Ripped? They look like they were <u>bit</u> off.
That's almost a year's worth of work! Scumbags! Oh, Jesus, Jesus....
Pointless.
What?
Someone want to tell me what's going on--
The four of you really have too much spare fucking time on your hands, don't you?
Women miscarry all the--
What's that?
Hmm? I dunno. Chafing from the backpack, something.
That'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back.
What'd you see?
For a blur?
Cotter'll kill you.
He'll never know.
At least go drink it somewhere spilling it won't drive him to suicide.
What is it you thought you saw on that tape?
Still working on it.
Elly Kedward?
Dad...?
Are you alright?
Jesus.
What?
What?
Slow it down, slow it down, whatever it is, we'll figure it out.
That's why she kills children.
You gonna be alright?
Sure. I'm sorry.
No big deal. I'm just trying to understand.
Get some more beer.
I think you closed the bar again. I'll have to go out.
What're you afraid's going to happen?
--bullshit--
The good old days: toasting marsh- mallows over a burning witch.
They never burned witches in this country, they hanged them.
She <u>wasn't</u> a witch.
Finally got her back to sleep.
Nick, what you should do is get her back up and get her to a goddamn <u>doctor</u>.
Jesus, you don't think I know that? You don't think I've tried? She won't fucking <u>go</u>-- she won't leave this place.
She's off her fucking rocker--
--I know!
I'm sorry.
Yeah, I know. It's...alright. We're all a little--
--a <u>lot</u>.
Heather.
Yeah.
Okay. Hypothetically.
Shoot.
You think....there could've been something up in those woods that Anna--
There's explanations. Rational explanations for everything that's happened. We'll drive ourselves crazy if we keep obsessing on supernatural what-ifs.
What?
Spare me.
We are being fucked with here, someone or something.
Domini.
Why in the world would <u>she</u>--
Domini's the only logical explanation.
I can't do it!
Gothic rune--the letter "S."
Put 'em together that's a "k." James Kurth--
--or Lyme Disease or poison sumac, or God knows what-else we could have picked up in the woods.
I should check on Anna.
Check the monitor, she's <u>fine</u>.
She's far from "fine."
No. We <u>all</u> go.
Anna--
"It's why the witch kills children."
I thought all witches were benign and good.
What the fuck's going on here?
Does she have marks, Nick--like the ones we have, that Domini had?
Why?
Does she, goddamnit??
It's <u>possible</u> for chrissake--
Like a blueprint for disembowelment.
There are <u>other</u> explanations! She is not the goddamn witch, that's insane!
Then just give me one of your explanations that all three of us'll buy.
Good morning, Sheriff's Office.
Yes! I need to speak to Sheriff Von Teer.
He's in a meeting. Could I have him--
--it's urgent!
Could I tell him what it's regarding?
....Ma'am?
I'm talking to Taos, New Mexico--
--yes--
--the Sheriff's Office--
--yes, Ma'am, can I help you with anything else?--
--his name's Von Teer! His daughter's named Domini!--
She wants me to talk to you, Heather.
Who <u>is</u> this??
Your mother's pastor.
What happened to my Dad??
There was an accident early this morning. Another car. Your father's injuries were fatal.
Yes.
I'll tell your mother not to expect you at the funeral.
Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.
You're gonna keep an eye on Marty and Ray, make sure nothing happens.
Thanks, Meurice.
Abby. What's the matter?
Jesus, I got a hangover. Want a drink?
No, I--
...For you I answer the door. If you wanna stay here, that's fine. But I'm retired.
Something happened with Marty and Ray--
...Ray stole a shitload of money from Marty. Until both of 'em calm down I'm not getting involved.
No Meurice, it's worse than that. Something really happened, I think Marty's dead--
What?! Did Ray tell you that?
...I mean, I don't know where he is, but he ain't dead.
Meurice--
...Ray?
Yeah.
What was that?
Why d'you wanna leave all this?
...Drive me to a motel?
You can stay at my place, I'll drop you there.
Where... where you going?
See a guy.
Don't go to the bar, Ray. I know him, that ain't a good idea.
Who was it?
What?
On the phone. Was it for you?
I don't know, he didn't say anything.
Uh-huh. So how do you know it was a he?
...I can find a place tomorrow, then I'll be outta your hair.
Well... the couch would be all right...
You can sleep on the bed if you want.
Well... I'm not gonna put you out of your bed...
You wouldn't be putting me out.
I could've sworn I heard something.
I knew it. 'Cause we wouldn't have heard anything if it was him. He's real careful. Fact is, he's anal.
...Huh?
...Well I'll be damned.
...He sent me to a psychiatrist to see if he could calm me down some.
Yeah? What happened?
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.
...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.
Uh-huh.
I said, Marty, how come you're anal and I gotta go to the psychiatrist?
Nothing. He's like you, he doesn't say much.
Thanks.
Except when he doesn't say things they're usually nasty.
...Mm-hmm.
When you don't they're usually nice.
...You ever get tired?
Hello?
Abby... you all right?
Ray?... What time is it?
...You all right?
Okay, see ya... Thanks, Ray.
...Ray?
...What?
Why didn't you get into bed?
I didn't think I could sleep. I'm surprised you could. Are you all right?
...You called me this morning.
...I just wanted to let you know that everything was all right. I took care of everything. Now all we have to do is keep our heads.
What happened?--Was Meurice there?
Well... what happened?
...Anyway, we got some time now. But we gotta be smart.
Ray--
...That's the only thing they told us in the service that was worth a goddamn--Where the hell's my windbreaker?
...That's what's important.
I... I mean what're you talking about, Ray? I haven't done anything funny.
...Who?
...What's going on with you two?
...Where is everything?
...You leaving?
...But first I gotta know what happened.
What do you want to know?
...I don't know, wasn't it you? Maybe a burglar broke in, and you found--
...So?
If he does come in I'm not here... What were you drinking, Debra?
Remy.
You've got a very sophisticated palate.
Thanks.
Listen, I got tickets for the Oilers and the Rams next week in the Astrodome. Ever sat on the fifty yard line?
You won't have to. I'll explain what a palate is.
So how long have you know Meurice?
...So what're you doing tonight?
It'll pass.
We don't seem to be communicating--
You want to hustle me. I don't want to be hustled. It's as simple as that. Now that I've communicated, why don't you leave?
I own the place.
Christ, I'm getting bored.
He needs a room, Dusty.
I reckon I can hear him. TV option, that's a dollar twenty, makes nine eighty-six plus tax.
Tell him the channels, Dusty.
Sure don't.
See, Wednesday's the special on RC Cola. I don't know if I explained about the TV option. If there's a TV in the room, you got to pay the option.
And how many room got TV, Dusty?
Hold it, hold it. What's tonight?
What?
What night is it?
...Friday?
Right. Friday night is Yankee night. Where're you from?
...He gave me a little pearl-handled .38 for out first anniversary.
Uh-huh.
...Figured I'd better leave before I used it on him. I don't know how you can stand him.
Well, I'm only an employee, I ain't married to him.
...I don't know. Sometimes I think there's something wrong with him. Like maybe he's sick? Mentally?... Or is it maybe me, do you think?
...What're you gonna do in Houston?
I'll figure something out... How come you offered to drive me in this mess?
I told you. I like you.
See, I never knew that.
Well now you do.
...You know that car?
No.
What's the matter?
...What was that back there?
Back where?
Sign.
I don't know. Motel... Abby--
Ray. Did you mean that, what you said before, or were you just being a gentleman?
Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.
Yeah.
I mean, I ain't a marriage counselor--
What "what"?
Am I fired? You wanna hit me? What?
I don't particularly want to talk to you.
Well... if you're not gonna fire me I might as well quit.
Then what'd you come here for?
...You get a refund though, if you tell me who else she's been sluicing.
I want that money. If you wanna tell me something, fine--
What did you take these for?
...Just doin' my job.
You called me, I knew they were there, so what do I need these for?
Well, I don't know... Call it a fringe benefit.
How long did you watch her?
Now that don't make much sense.
...Anything else?
...That's the test, ain't it? Test of true love--
Got a job for you.
...Well, if the pay's right and it's legal I'll do it.
If the pay's right I'll do it.
It's, uh... it's in reference to that gentleman and my wife. The more I think about it the more irritated I get.
...Gee, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what you want me to do or is it a secret?
You want me to kill 'em.
I didn't say that. Well?
Well what?
What do you think?
So, uh... this wouldn't interest you.
I'm supposed to do a murder--two murders--and just trust you not to go simple on me and do something stupid. I mean real stupid. Now why should I trust you?
For the money.
...There's a big--
I want you to go fishing.
...What?
Yeah. Is it...
Ya catch any fish?
...What?
Ya catch any fish?
Yeah...
...What kind of fish?
Just the ten thousand'll be fine.
Dead, huh?
...What did you do with the bodies?
It's taken care of. The less you know about it the better.
Something I got to ask you, Marty. I've been very very careful. Have you been very very careful?
Of course.
...I just made a call about that. It'll look fine.
...it's too damn risky.
...Count it if you want.
Yeah, I know. Pour 'em short.
Has Ray come in yet?
No, he's off tonight. Where was he last night?
How would I know?
What's this?
You said the usual--
Red Label.
Right. Sorry.
Pour that back.
What.
Don't throw that out.
Deuce in the corner needs help.
What's this?
What.
This.
Jack Daniels. Don't worry, I'm paying for it.
That's not the point.
What's the point?
The point is we don't serve niggers here.
...I thought you were dead. Going home?
No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.
Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?
...I don't want that asshole near my money. I don't even want him in the bar.
Howdy stranger.
Meurice. Sorry I didn't show last night.
Is Marty here?
Not here tonight. Wasn't here last night. He's especially not back in his office.
Thanks Meurice.
Got a problem, Meurice?
...Why?
...and Abby. Maybe. But as far as I'm concerned that only leaves one fucking possibility.
Where was I?
You we telling me about the Ring of Fire.
What day is it today, Angie?
Tuesday.
Tuesday is ladies' night.
What?
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.
Jeffrey. you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
Doctor Gynde. my whole family's sick. What's going on?
Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
Okay honey. that sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?
I've seen a few.
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look. I better go.
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. for instance, many marriages are saved by.
Frank. Come in.
Hey, I brought some friends. and some beer.
Suave. goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer?
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here, is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. goddam!!! This is the suavest guy I know. look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those
To your health, Frank.
Shit. let's drink to something else. let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.
See you Tuesday, Frank.
Are you Detective Williams?
Yes.
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. there behind Vista, I found an ear.
You did? A human ear?
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
Come into the study a minute.
Detective Williams here. yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. yeah, copy. Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more. But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
I was the same way when I was you age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
It must be great.
Jeffrey?
Yes?
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
Okay.
Anything you can tell me?
The criminals are winning.
Is that why you say it's horrible?
Yes.
I guess you've seen some bad things.
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
Why do you do it?
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
What is this? What color is it?
What color is it?
Jeffrey! Come on in.
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
Okay. come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Okay?
And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs. and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and. . and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
Is Sandy part of this?
No. not at all.
Who knows you have these?
Only you. and the photo lab.
For now. Alright. you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment. Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!! Detective Williams. hurry. I'm in the apartment. hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon. I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different. He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Not yet.
Hello, baby.
Shut up. It's daddy. shithead.
Hello, daddy.
. MOMMY!.
. mommy's here.
Who's this fuck?
He's a friend. from the neighborhood. we were just talking.
Where are we going, Frank?
Hey. Tits. I'm taking your neighbor to the country. maybe something for you too.
Frank?
You want to see him too, right?
Yes, but.
Look at these. What are these?
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?
Those are my breasts.
Can I feel 'em?
Frank. he didn't mean it. Leave him alone. come on. He didn't mean it.
Frank gone?
Yeah. but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Bull.
Alright, suit yourself.
He's comin' back?. What for?
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me. and you. and really it's all thanks to Don. isn't it. remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
Oh he forced you, huh?
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. he's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. let me
No way. get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
Yes? What is it?
Pest control. gotta do your apartment.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.
That oughta do it.
GET OUT OF THERE!! GET OUT!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name?. WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
Jeffrey.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
Jeffrey nothing.
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet. Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
I wanted to see you.
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
Nobody.
Shit. You better tell me something.
I was. an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
. I saw you come in, talk on the phone. get undressed.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone . Tell me. Word for word.
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
Well.
THEN WHAT?
Then you got undressed.
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
Never before this.
How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you. Get undressed. I want to see you.
No. Come on.
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
What do you want from me?
I . I don't know.
Do you like that?
Do you like talk like that?
No.
Don't. I don't like that. What do you want?
Nothing. Are you alright?
Sure I'm alright.
Don?
No.
Thank you. honey.
Do you like the way I feel?
Yes.
Yes.
See my nipples?
Yes.
You can hit me, if you want to.
Do you like me?
Yes, I like you.
I made it go down the toilet.
Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!! What was it?
Do you know?
You don't?
No. What is happening?
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
Then don't talk about killing.
Did I say that?. I didn't mean it. or did I? Sometimes I think it would be fun. Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret. I want to die.
Don't say that.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
Hi. can I come in?
. I. uh.
I looked for you in my closet tonight. It's crazy, I don't know where you came from but. I like you.
I liked being with you last night.
Oh shit.
Frank? .can you stand up?
Nice guy. Who's he?
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
There you go again. stop saying that. You can make it.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
Look.
No.
Falling.
Who is Don?
Don?. Are you in with them?
No. But you're in very big trouble.
I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. if you need to. come to where I live. O.K.?
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. you like me, huh?
Yes.
. or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
No. I should go.
Come in.
It used to make me laugh .but.
I'm sorry .maybe I better go Dorothy.
Yes. Frank-
Frank is coming?
No. how could he?. Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay. . don't hate me.
I sure don't hate you.
I'm not crazy. I know the difference between right and wrong.
Do you like my body?
What do you want to do?
I'm doing it.
Are you a bad boy?
Whatiya mean?
Do you want to do bad things? Anything. anything.
What do you want?
I want you to hurt me.
You like to open me. don't you?
Yes.
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
Frank would open you.
Okay. I know you've been scared. now you want to scare someone.
Does that scare you?
Shut up.
Beeeee careful.
Come on Dorothy.
Look, snap out of it, will ya?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
I asked first.
Sometimes I think I do.
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
I love you Don with all my heart.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
You. what?
You put your disease in me. your semen. it's hot and full of disease.
There's no disease, I can tell you.
Men are crazy. then they put their craziness into me. then it makes me crazy. then they aren't so crazy for awhile. then they put their craziness in me again. . it's burning me. but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
I'm glad you do.
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. there is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. in every hole. It's opening me to a death.
Dorothy. no!
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell. it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
You called me Jeffrey.
I did. are you?
Yes.
Why are you here? Hmmmmmmmm!!!! Ok.
I guess I should go.
I want you to stay with me.
I'll call you.
Okay. soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
What?
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
Oh no.
Yeah, it's me.
Where have you been? Oh God. they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
It's okay. it's okay.
Shh. I'll tell you.
They hurt his head.
Who, Dorothy?
Hold me, Don.
Don?. Where is he?
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. to make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue. blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
Yeah. I guess I did. What's going to happen to me?
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though. you're okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.
No thanks.
No thanks. what does that mean?
I don't want to go.
Go where?
On a ride.
Heineken.
Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.
Here's to Ben.
Hey? . You like to walk.
What?
What are you lookin' at?
Nothing.
Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet. straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?
Yes.
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
Okay Frank.
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes. pour the fuckin' beer.
There ya go.
Yeah, how did you know?
Oh yeah?
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
Yeah I did. treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
Am I bothering you?
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
Yes.
How is Central these days?
Terrible. boring.
What else is new?. right?
Yeah. What are you doing now?
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
That's too bad.
What do you know about the ear?. anything?
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it?
Come on. you brought it up. Do you know anything?
I don't really know much but bits and pieces . I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. and a musician. and some others.
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
No. this has been going on for some time . several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body. only parts.
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
Maybe so.
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
Yeah. It's close by. that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
I guess you have to get back home soon?
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long . the police are watching.
Where are they?
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
I don't know. like I said, she's not my father's case.
Oh yeah. What about those other people? . Anything?
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
Yeah, I guess so. What are you going to do now that you're home?
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.
Still, it must be kinda rough.
What happened to him?
I've gotta go in.
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
You hungry or thirsty, or both?
I don't know.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
I don't want to cause any trouble.
I'm here, aren't I?
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
Alright, now tell me. What is it?
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. sometimes, in some cases. it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and observe.
You said it was a strange world. and you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. .Aren't you curious about my plan?
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Now, how are you going to do that?
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
What will I say when she comes to the door?
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. a few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
I don't know. it sounds like a good daydream, . but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
Now. we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window .alright?
Alright.
Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?
Oh bother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay. good luck . three minutes, no sooner.
Are you alright?
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key. Pretty nifty, huh?
Yeah, if it opens the door.
So. what's next?
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
I owe you. since I goofed up this one.
You didn't goof it up, but. you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday. do you have a date tonight?
Yes. I do.
You really want to do this, don't you?
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
I already know. The "Slow Club." It's on Route 7.
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
What's the plan.
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
Brilliant.
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
I'd like an ice-cold Heineken.
That sounds good.
Here's to. an interesting experience.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
Why not?
It's crazy and dangerous. My God. I shouldn't have told you.
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
Yeah. but.
Leave it in the front of your house for me. okay?
O.K.
Could you wait a little while. this key may not fit.
. I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
I. I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
Oh, okay. can I call?
Okay. yeah, call.
Look. it can wait till Sunday.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
Yeah.
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
Are you sure?
Okay. thanks.
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you. okay?
Well, how did it go?. What happened?
Well. I've found out some things. nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
What did you see?
What's with Mike?
He got a little jealous.
I'm sorry, I didn't.
You want a Dairy Queen?
You want to tell me about it?
. OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. this is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. they have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them
Wow. Should you tell my father?
I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.
You saw a lot in one night.
. Actually. I've been in twice.
Twice. without her sensing anything?
Yes.
Did you see her undressed?
Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know.
Yeah?
That doesn't bother you, does it?
Who, me? Why should it?
That's what I thought.
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
I don't know. I had a dream. in fact. the night I met you. . in the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. you know, birds. robins stood for love. and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. and it felt like that love would be the only thing that would
Yeah I guess so. You're a neat girl.
So are you. I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
No, silly - I'm still in school you know. but I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.
Okay. be careful.
Can I give you a kiss good night?
You better not, Jeffrey.
Okay. okay.
Goodnight.
You were late.
I'm really sorry.
What am I going to do?
You want to go talk to him?
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Shoot.
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
Oh yeah?
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well-dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. now get this. In the distance was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
Jeffrey!!
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
Yeah.
Jeffrey?. Why?
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. and it's all secret.
You like mysteries that much?
You worry about me really?
Great. Hey. I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things. that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
Everything okay?
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
You didn't tell him about me?
I should never had gotten you going on this. Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!
Okay.
What is it?
What was that all about?
Nothing. really! It's good to see you.
It's good to see you.
Where to?
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
It's okay.
... You look beautiful.
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
You want to dance?
I can't dance fast.
Really?
Really. you want to dance with someone else?
NO.
Let's wait for some slow one.
You want to dance?
Oh my God. What's wrong?
My father has a gun at home.
No.
Dorothy! ... Dorothy!
Dorothy Vallens?
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
Probably not. no. Why?
OK. Let's get her over to your father's.
I should go with her, Sandy.
Go ahead.
... Sandy?.
Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone. the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.
No Jeffrey!!
Look Jeffrey.
Hi Dad.
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
uh uh.
Are you feeling okay?
Good to see you, son.
How ya doin' Dad?
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
I mean, for good, Jeffrey.
For good?. I can't. Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
What time are visiting hours?
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Well. Okay.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
Yeah?
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
What?
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
Thanks a lot, Mom.
I'm going out for awhile.
Do you want the car?
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Can I use the car tonight?
God. you scared me.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
Nothing. I'm fine.
No.
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
Well.
No. you're right.
I mean. some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
Hello. uh. my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.
Yeah, I know.
Would you like a piece of cake?
No. No thank you.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. real good.
He comes over to study.
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
That sounds great!
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
Sandy? ...Sandy, please.
Mike's gotta go. Nice to meet you.
What are watchin' this junk for?
You can change it if you want to.
I don't know why we have to watch T.V.
Sandy?. Could I talk to you a minute?
Come on out a minute, okay?
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.
QUIET! Callate! Where's Diego?
I don't know. He sent me. I'm George.
I've been holding this shit for him for three weeks. You tell Diego I don't appreciate it. You tell him I want my money by Friday. Can you do that?
Greetings, Mr. George.
Where do you guys want to count?
On the plane.
Pleased to meet you finally, George. I am Augusto Oliveras.
Norman Cay is not a person. He is an island, George. In the Bahamas. From what they say, it is free and it's Diego's new home.
Let us walk. From what I understand, Diego has bought a hundred and sixty acres, a marina, a hotel, and an airstrip.
Motherfucker works fast.
The word is that soon he is to be king of the middle empire. He is doing multiple runs right now and using the island as a jump-off point.
He what?
Yes. Jack Stevens is already a very busy man. Along with many others. You shouldn't stay away so long.
No honey, I'm alright.
Three-hundred kilos is a very big load, Georgie. Why don't we start small?
No. I have the space. I figured it out. This is what I want to do.
Alright. I'll ask Pablo, tell him it's for you. I don't think there will be a problem.
Five-thousand per kilo.
Ha ha. That's too much, Georgie. Those days are over. The rate is one-thousand dollars. Inflation, you know?
I'm so glad you two could make it. Mirtha, look at you. So beautiful. You look like you're about to burst.
Thanks. I am. Where's Martha?
Que va hacer?
Blanca, por favor.
Mama, vos sos bien antigua. Como lo va a matar con un picahielo. Eso era en su tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta. El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar, le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima.
Are you sure this guy is cool?
Nothing like this back home.
This is it for me.
What is?
Just everything. You. California. The beach. This spot right here. I feel like I belong here, you know? It just feels right.
You happy, baby?
Are you sure this guy is cool?
Nothing like this back home.
This is it for me.
What is?
Just everything. You. California. The beach. This spot right here. I feel like I belong here, you know? It just feels right.
You happy, baby?
We're gonna call it California sinsemilla. Sounds exotic.
Should we buy it?
Are you kidding?
Honey, your nose!
You wanna split?
Yeah, I don't feel so well.
Are you sure you're okay? You're pale.
I feel like shit. Me and my frigging nosebleeds.
I'm taking you to the doctor when we get home, and I don't want to hear any arguments.
Would you be bummed out if I didn't go to Chicago with you?
No, not at all. Sure. You're right. You fly home and get some rest.
Nice first impression. A nose bleed in front of your parents.
Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself.
Oh, they weren't that bad. I mean, they were kind of cute.
Promise me that we'll never be like them. I don't want to wind up like that.
Surprise.
Baby, you didn't have to come.
What, and miss all the fun? C'mon, not a chance. So, what's the verdict?
Lawyer says he can plead it down to five years. I'll serve two.
Two years. George, I can't wait that long.
What? You're not going to wait for me?
George, I went to the doctor. I don't have two years.
Tuna, this is crap.
I know it's not the greatest. It's commercial.
You can't sell this to your friends.
Man. Fuck you guys. I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
Tuna, this is crap.
I know it's not the greatest. It's commercial.
You can't sell this to your friends.
Man. Fuck you guys. I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
Mr. Jung, you're a convicted felon, correct?
Yes, I am.
Do you have any agreement or understanding whatsoever with the United States government in regards to your testimony?
No, I cam here out of my own volition.
Excuse me?
Something about vengance being best served cold.
Really. Are you getting paid, Mr. Jung?
Excuse me?
Mr. Jung, don't you have an agreement or understanding with the United States Government in connection with your testimony in this case?
I'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no chance of parole. Even if they cut my sentence in half I'll be seventy-three years old. That's some fucking deal. I don't know if the parole board, the judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself can get me out of here. I have a really bad record, I'm not sure what's going to happen.
Not so fast. I would like to go over the details.
What details? I put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs.
Hmm. I see. Will there be clothes in the suitcase?
What? Yeah, sure.
Whose cloths? Your clothes?
My clothes, your clothes. What does it matter?
I would like to know the contents. Every detail is important.
What are we doing here, Diego? This guy's a clown. He's talking about clothes.
I demand to know everything. I do not trust six-hundred thousand dollars of coca to someone I don't know.
It's a lousy fifteen kilos. I piss fifteen kilos.
The coca is my responsibility!
Why are you speaking?
Excuse me?
You. Your responsibility is over. You do not fly. You are not a pilot. You are not a distributor. You introduced us to Mr. Stevens and the use of his airplane. That is all. You make a percentage. A generous one. And you're lucky to get that.
I see. How much?
Mirtha.
What can I do for you guys?
We want some grass.
I know what you want. But, first of all, are you cops?
No.
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
We're not cops. We're from Massachusettes. I mean, does he look like a cop?
What the fuck is that?
What can I do for you guys?
We want some grass.
I know what you want. But, first of all, are you cops?
No.
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
We're not cops. We're from Massachusettes. I mean, does he look like a cop?
What the fuck is that?
The way we figure it, Barbara flies to Boston twice a week. Two bags per flight. Twenty-five pounds in each bag.
You're kidding, right? That's a hundred pounds a week.
I don't know...
Here's the best part. We can charge five-hundred a pound.
Come on, George, no one is going to pay that.
Goodness.
Goodness is right. If you do the math, that's over thirty grand a week profit. I want you to be my partner on this, Derek. Fifty-fifty. That's fifteen thousand a week for you, my friend. In your pocket, free and clear.
And I only deal with you?
I don't think so.
Are you sure you want to do this in front of everyone?
What did I tell you?
It's great and everything, but what am I going to do with all this?
Half a million for you. Half a million for me. One-point-three five for the Colombians.
Nice doing business with you, George.
It's nothing personal, George. Just business.
Happy Birthday, George. Mirtha invited me.
Yeah. She told me.
Look, I'm sorry about everything. I feel like an idiot. You were right. I did fuck you. And then Diego fucked me. Cut me out, too.
I heard.
I lost sight of everything. Forgot who my friends were.
It's in the past. I'm out of the business now, so forget about it. No hard feelings. We need to move on. And besides, I'm sorry, too.
You?
For calling you a homo.
Christ almighty, George. Feed her a cheeseburger or something. What does she weight, eighty pounds?
I want my kid out of protective custody. Now. No fucking around. My wife and my kid on a plane tonight. I sign when they call me safe and sound.
No fucking way.
George? You better get yourself a good lawyer this time. We're gonna nail your ass to the wall on this one.
Oh hey, one more thing?
What's that?
If you don't mind me asking, what is the reason you are in this place?
What?
Your offense? Why are you here?
I don't want to talk about it.
Intriguing. I see. Would you like to know my crime?
Not really, no.
No?
I don't like a lot of conversation, Diego.
Oh, come on, George. If we are to be friends, we must trust each other.
Murder.
What do you got there, Diego?
Nothing. Just a little project.
What kind of project?
Never mind. Not for you to worry.
I thought you said we were roommates. That we should talk about everything.
You have your intrigues. I have mine. This is a happy day for me, George. Nine months from today, I will be in Medellin sipping champagne. In nine months, I am free. How much time do you have?
Twenty-six months.
Twenty-six months? For murder? I must be your lawyer.
I've got to get out of here, Diego.
Only two ways I know to leave here early. One is to escape.
I never believed you were a murderer. I knew. I knew you are a magico. I have seen it in you. It's in your spirit.
I'm tired, Diego. Go to bed.
You like to make the boundaries disappear. It's not only the money, is it, George? The adventure is part of the victory. It's the thrill, ah?
Good night.
In my country, I am a magico. A man with a dream. A man on the rise. To take nothing and make it something, okay? I have failed my dream, but I will accomplish. That is why I am in your country. Yes, I lose my freedom. But they do not take my dream. Do you have a dream, George?
I would if I could get some sleep.
Yes, you have a dream. And maybe you accomplish your dream. But yet you failed. Why?
Because I got caught.
No, my brother.
Because they caught me?
George? What do you know about cocaine?
I don't know, Diego. I've got a good thing going already. Everybody smokes pot. It's easy. Cocaine is a rich man's drug. It's too expensive.
That's over fifty-thousand dollars profit per kilo.
And that's wholesale. Cut it a few times and retail, you're looking at two, three-hundred thousand.
Oh my G-d.
Yes. And a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana. Everything is the same, George, except instead of thousands, you are making millions.
Jesus Christ. Jesus fucking Christ.
Now do you see what I am saying?
Getting it here is no problem. Trust me. I'll fly it in myself if I have to. What about supply? How much can we get?
What type of planes do you have?
Four passenger, single engine Cessna.
How many kilos can we fit in these planes?
I don't know. A hundred, hundred and fifty. How many miles is it from Colombia to Miami?
Fifteen hundred. We'll have to stop somewhere to refuel.
We'll refuel in the Bahamas. I know someone there.
Diego Delgado, please?
Allo?
Diego? It's George.
George, hallo! Today is the day, ah? Are you out?
Yeah, I'm out.
Congratulations, brother. I've been waiting for you.
How are we doing?
Perfect, George. Perfect. Everything is fine down here. Everything is all set up.
Do we need a plane? How does this work? When do I see you?
You need to come down here, everybody meets everybody. Ho ho ho. Ha ha ha. We do one for good faith and then we talk about airplanes.
I can't go anywhere, Diego. I'm on parole. I can't leave the state.
But you must. It's the only way.
I just got released five minutes ago.
Good to see you, Diego.
Fifteen kilos. Seven and a half in each suitcase. You receive a hundred thousand dollars upon delivery.
Please, continue.
What's the matter, George?
What's the matter? We're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit.
A million dollars for our first run is not bad, George.
It is bad. It's chump change. We might as well be hauling suitcases across the border. We're getting screwed.
I know.
And what happens when these guys stop paying? Sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out. Then where are we?
This is only part of the business, George. A very small part. Don't worry, there is so much more to do. Which reminds me, I need a favor from you. I must go to Colombia.
What is it, George? Because I have to get home. I've got a parole officer waiting for me.
George.
Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you? It's been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money.
Bad news, George. I'm in Colombia.
Jesus Christ, George, I don't see you in two years, and you show up at my door with a hundred and ten pounds of cocaine?
Thirty-six hours. I can't believe it. Everything is gone in thirty-six hours.
I think it's fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek.
Touche.
George, good to see you, my brother.
What the fuck is going on? When did you get out of jail?
Pablo used his influence. Now, George, watch what you say. Everybody hears everything. A lot of things get said and done that, well, let's just say this isn't America. Life is cheap here, you know? No offense, but you know what I'm saying?
Yeah. Keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking.
Right. Now who is the person in California? The connection?
Just a friend.
Who? I need to know. Ah, never mind. We'll talk about it later.
Three million. I counted it twice.
I'm calling it three.
We're half a million off.
Fuck it. I'm not counting it again.
Weight it. If it's sixty pounds, it's three. If it's fifty, it's two-point five.
Where do I put this!?
There's no room.
Are you comfortable with this?
George, we've got sixty-one million dollars. It's either here or someplace else. We've got to put it somewhere. Unless you want to launder it.
And keep only forty-percent? No thanks.
I'm married, George. Me. I can't believe it. Can you believe I'm married, George?
You're a lucky man, Diego.
I love you, my brother, do you know that?
Three years. How long have we been in business? Three years. Does she get to meet your connection? Was she good enough?
Shut up, Diego. They're going to be here any minute. I'm trying to concentrate.
I'm very angry with you, George. Very angry. You don't take me to California, but you take your bitch wife? A woman? I understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this. You and me.
What do you need my connection for, Diego? What are you going to do with it?
Jesus fucking Christ, Diego. I ain't telling you. It's just business. Now, shut up. You're driving me crazy.
Nothing. Todo esta bien.
Everything is not alright. I bring you in, and you slap my fucking face!
Take it easy! Everything's okay!
Estoy bien, okay? Everything is alright. There's no problem. Okay? This never happened. No one has to know anything about this. Diego, I want you to calmly tell them where the fucking coke is. Do it now.
Derek Foreal.
What?
George, I am happy to see you. How are you, my brother?
No more brothers, Diego.
Of course we are brothers. Why do you say that? You hurt me, George.
You fucked me, Diego.
I did not.
You went behind my back and you cut me out.
No, I never. I would not do that, George. Never.
You'd better kill me now, Diego, because you're a dead man.
He's in tachycardia. George, your heart is racing. Have you been using drugs?
Coke.
Cocaine? How much?
I don't know. Maybe eighteen grams.
In how long? A week?
Today.
Well, you know. It's um...
Yeah, layaway.
Surprised to see me?
Take your boots off. You're tan.
Mexico.
Yeah. We heard all about it. I want you to know I'm deeply sorry about your girlfriend.
Barbara.
Yes, Barbara. She was very pretty.
Thank you. Have you been getting the money I sent you?
G-d, son.
It's a family heirloom.
I've seen those in magazines. They're not cheap.
Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.
Tell him I don't want to see him. Tell him he's not welcome here.
I just can't get over the size of that ring. I just love it. Fred, look at it. Tell me you don't love that ring.
I'm just happy that George has found someone he cares for.
Layaway shmayaway.
That's right. Layaway. Something you wouldn't know anything about, you cheapskate.
Who's the cheapskate?
Yeah. Nice.
So, this is the man who takes fifty kilos and makes them disappear in one day?
Actually, it was three.
The man who gives us the airplanes. The man from America. The mafia. Chicago. Boom boom. Hollywood. You are going to open for us the gates of Hollywood, George?
It would be my pleasure.
The man in the garden. He was full of courage.
Un sapo?
Un rata - no good. But he could have run, fled the country. Gone to the policia. But then his wife, his children, his parents, his friends, many people would die.
Yes.
But, never mind. I am thinking we can do much together. This problem with Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very silly business. To release him from the carcel, it causes me much inconvenience. The fifty kilos could have been a big problem. And I don't like problems.
I like you, George. You are loyal. That is good. That is rare. Maybe crazy. Yes. I can tell already. You are like me. I look at you and I see myself. It's in the eyes, no, George?
Yes, it is.
So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, George?
Yes, sir. As much as you can give me.
I like to come up here. To make the decisions. To be one with nature.
It's beautiful.
What do I think? I don't want my answer to be influenced by what I want, so I'm going to have to say I don't know.
Yes. I do not know, either. What do you want, George?
I want money.
Yes. Money. Which is what, George?
Freedom.
Power?
Yeah, maybe.
Family.
Sure.
Beautiful girls?
Keep them coming.
Keep them coming? Ah, yes. Ha ha. You are right. But money.
Money.
And Diego?
George, you look terrible.
Yeah, well...
Diego?
Yeah.
Please. Sit down. We'll drink some scotch.
I didn't come here to drink scotch.
I see. I'm sorry about this, George. I'm not happy about this situation. It's bad. You now know who your Brutus is.
You know why I'm here. You know what I have to do. I came here for permission. Out of respect, Pablo. This is bullshit, he's making me look like a punk.
It is very difficult. Diego makes me a lot of money. If Diego goes so does the money. You were an excellent teacher, George. When the student has learned well, the teacher is no longer necessary. We must remember we have wives, friends, familia. Even familia that has not been born. But sometimes, we must forget as well. I am like you. I must
You're saying life will take care of Diego?
Life will take care of everybody. Diego, me, you. It is the teacher.
I get it. I'm really pissed, Pablo. You know the DEA knows about Norman's Cay. For Chrissakes, Diego worships Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's fucked up!
I'm sorry, George.
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do? You and me, Pablo? Are we good?
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different. Something free form, you know? Something for me, and college just isn't it.
That's too bad. You would have been the first one in the family.
I know.
Alright. You want me to get your old job back? Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
What are you going to do?
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different. Something free form, you know? Something for me, and college just isn't it.
That's too bad. You would have been the first one in the family.
I know.
Alright. You want me to get your old job back? Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
What are you going to do?
May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face...
Just low.
You loved her, didn't you? You really loved her.
Yeah, Dad. I really did. What am I gonna do?
You mad at me?
Not mad.
Yeah, you are. I can tell by the way you look at me.
I just don't know what you're thinking. I don't understand your choices. You know, the police are looking for you.
I know. I'm great at what I do, Dad. I mean, I'm really great.
So, business is going good. I've got this import/export thing going on in Miami that's been very profitable. With my investments...
You're like your mother. You love money.
Dad.
No, it's good. You have a family. It's good if it makes you happy. It's nice to have nice things. Are you happy, son?
Hi.
She's angry. It's all over the news.
Yeah. Listen. I'm going to be going away for awhile.
You're not going to trial?
No.
Give this to Mom, will you?
Money. You and your mother. All the time chasing it. I never understood it.
Give it to her, Dad. It'll make her happy.
Tell Mom, you know...
And that FBI agent, Trout? When he had to get on his knees to put my boots on? You said...
...you sonofabitch. Putting on George's boots.
I guess I kind of lost sight of things. "May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face, and the winds of destiny carry you aloft to dance with the stars." Love, George.
That was a beautiful message.
I meant every word of it.
How are you doing, George?
What do you guys want?
You hear about your old friend, Diego?
What the fuck? Is he going to walk?
Don't be stupid, George. We've got him. We've got him dead to rights. But like I said, this is top priority so we're handing out free passes on this one. And the first one's got your name on it. Cut your sentence in half, maybe more.
Figured it out.
Figured what out?
It's oregano. You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this?
George.
Figured it out.
Figured what out?
It's oregano. You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this?
George.
Look what the cat dragged in.
What the fuck are you talking about, man?
Source? What about Derek?
Hello.
Hello.
Do I know you?
I don't think so.
Why are you smiling?
Why are you smiling?
I don't know. My name is George.
I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
You better know what you're doing, George. You're playing with fire.
Jesus Christ.
Oh, don't be such a fucking hypocrite. I quit smoking, didn't I?
George. Oh, Jesus Christ, George. Look at you.
Shhh, honey, never mind. It's alright. It's over. I quit the business. I'm out.
Pablo said no?
Look, Mirtha. She's walking.
She did that before.
No. These are her first steps. Watch her.
Yeah. I know. She did that before.
But this is...
I said, I've seen it before.
Alright.
Can you lift the furnace. I need money.
Where are you going?
No, that's alright.
What are we going to do?! What are we going to use for money?!
Please, Mirtha. I'll start working for Augusto. I'll talk to him tonight. I'll do something.
Not in front of the kid.
There's a fucking cop behind us, Mirtha. Be cool, will ya.
Fuck you, George, just fucking drive.
Hey, why don't you just put a "I'm doing cocaine" sign on the car. What is your fucking problem?
My problem? We're broke, that's my fucking problem. And you're a fucking spy.
What?
You should have taken better care of me, you know? You've been away a long time. Four years. Say something.
What do you want me to say? I'm in prison. You should know. You put me here.
What do you want?
You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?
Yeah. She told me. You walk her to school.
Yeah, so I've been thinking. I love her, y'know? I kind of want to have her. I've been away for so long. Make up for the missed time, you know?
I haven't seen one dollar from you. You haven't paid me one cent in child support, alimony.
Yeah, well. I'm working on that. I've got something going.
Yeah? I better see some money out of it.
Hey, look. You start paying, who knows what will happen. You're a good father, George. I always gave you that. But you've got to talk to her.
Yeah.
She's getting big. Getting her own ideas.
Hey, George. You okay?
Mirtha, what's going on? Everything okay with Kristina?
Kristina's fine.
Is she here? Is she coming?
Is she here? George, Kristina hates you. You fucked her over one too many times. And I'm not here to socialize. Did you hear about Diego?
Yeah.
Well, I got a call from Pablo. He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down. His exact words were "Fuck Diego."
He wants me to testify? Is that what he's asking me to do?
Mirtha, how are you doing?
Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart. Don't be upset.
I don't know.
Are we gonna split up?
What are you doing here?
Nothing. I just wanted you to know I was out. I just wanted to see you.
Well, here I am. See?
How are you doing?
George, you just can't show up, tell me you love me, and have everything be okay.
Dad.
What?
You can call me Dad if you want.
I don't want, alright? It's not funny. I'm really pissed off, George. You blew it, now leave me alone.
Kristina, c'mon, I'm sorry. I'm going to make this right. I've got a few things going on...
What do you want from me?
Just to walk with you. I want to be your dad again.
Let me ask you something. If you could go anywhere in the world, anywhere, where would you want to go?
You mean, like a trip?
California? You can go anywhere in the world. India. Tibet. Australia. Paris. And you choose California?
Yeah.
What is it? A Disneyland thing?
No. I just kind of like the sound of it.
California, huh?
Bye, Dad. See you in the morning, okay?
I'm thinking about getting out of town this week. You want to come with me?
Where are you going?
I don't know. Maybe California.
You swear?
Yeah. Go out there, check it out, see what it's like. I've got some stuff to do this week, but I'm thinking maybe Thursday. Thursday after school.
You know I can't. Mom will never let me go.
You let me take care of your mother. You just pack your bags.
But I've got school.
There's schools in California.
You swear?
That's right. Three o'clock. Thursday. At your mother's. You and me. It's a date.
I don't believe you.
I swear. On my life.
Swear on my life.
I'm sorry, baby. I'm so sorry.
It's alright, Dad.
I didn't mean to...
I fucked up.
Shhhh.
I love you. I love you so much. You've got to know that. You've got to know.
I know, Dad. I love you too.
But I have a visitor.
Not today, George. Time to go back.
But I want to put her name on the list for tomorrow. My daughter.
Okay, George.
Because she's visiting me.
Mr. Jung, do you know Diego Delgado?
Yes, I do.
Do you see him here in the courtroom?
Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.
Mr. Jung, can you describe the circumstances of how you began talking about cocaine with Mr. Delgado?
It's a four-man operation. Two on the ground. Two in the air.
Who's the co-pilot?
You're looking at him. We provide the plane, transportation cost, U.S. landing spot, and take it to wherever you want it to go. You provide the pick up point in South America, and are responsible for payment. You assume all the bust risks. We take sixty-five percent of all transportation fees, ten percent of the gross, plus our expenses. This is not a negotiation,
Sounds fine. I'll need to meet everybody.
You saved my life, Dulli. You'll never fucking know. All you guys. Everyone just got a raise. Instead of ten percent, you get fifteen.
Jesus, George, fifteen percent. That's an extra two-hundred large.
Ramon tells me you are looking for some mota.
For instance, something like this?
Very nice. I'll take it.
Ha ha ha. You are funny. Really, how much will you be needing?
All of it. As much as you've got. A couples thousand pounds. I'll be back in a week with a plane.
Listen, Americano, it is very nice to meet you, but maybe we are going too fast. You take a little and then come back.
I don't need a little. I need a lot.
Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well. We must be careful.
What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars? Would that eliminate some of your concerns?
Good to see you, Jorge. You are a man of your word.
Well, I'll tell you. I was walking down the beach, minding my business, when who did I see but this fucking guy. I didn't know you guys were living in California.
Yeah, but what are you doing out here?
I'm on vacation. On my way back to school.
This calls for a joint. You want to do the honors?
Right on.
G-d, I'm stoned. I'm stoned. I'm really...
Stoned?
I wish there was shit like this back home.
Yeah?
Yeah?
It's not enough.
So?
Okay. So we need a source. Where do we start?
Not that far, only halfway. You sure you know what you're doing?
Holy shit, Dulli!
Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo!
Are we good?
Nice weed, huh?
No shit, Kevin?
Smith. Hampshire....
Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, nine. Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, a thousand. It's all there. Wow. A hundred and twenty-eight thousand dollars.
What's the matter, George? Something wrong? You look like you just fucked your mother.
This is bullshit, George. We're never going to find anything down there.
I can't believe we're stealing a plane.
Look around. I've put everything at your disposal. Go take a look with your own eyes.
The strike is a success; but ...
But the NLF has always spoken of a strike as a demonstration ...
And you believe the NLF?
They seemed to be plausible this time. A general strike is a good argument for the UN.
Colonel Mathieu ... Much has been said lately not only of the successes obtained by the paratroopers, but also of the methods that they have employed ... Can you tell us something about this?
It is an inevitable stage in revolutionary war; from terrorism, one passes to insurrection ... as from open guerrilla warfare one passes to real war, the latter being the determining factor ...
Dien Bien Phu?
In Indochina, <U>they</U> won.
And here?
Excuse me, colonel. I have the impression that perhaps due to excessive prudence ... my colleagues continue to ask the same allusive questions, to which you can only respond in an allusive manner. I think it would be better to call things by their right names; if one means torture, then one should call it torture.
I understand. What's your question?
The questions have already been asked. I would only like some precise answers, that's all ...
Let's try to be precise then. The word "torture" does not appear in our orders. We have always spoken of interrogation as the only valid method in a police operation directed against unknown enemies. As for the NLF, they request that their members, in the event of capture, should maintain silence for twenty-four hours, and then, they may talk. Thus, the organization has already
The law is often inconvenient, colonel ...
Go ahead! C'mon ... Repeat everything from the beginning, and then we'll let you go. Name ...
Sid Ahmed.
Second name.
Sail.
Which "district" do you belong to?
Second district ...
Second district ... Explain better ...
Second district, Casbah, West Algiers.
What "group"?
Third group.
Third group. What's your assignment?
You afraid of these ...?
Don't move, Hacene.
Why are you afraid? We've always been friends. One might even say that I brought you up ... Isn't it true, Ali?
It's true.
What's happened to you?
How much are they paying you?
They're not paying me anything. They've already warned you twice; this is the last warning. Decide.
What ... What must I decide?
With an unloaded pistol?
Let's suppose you were a spy. In prison, when the NLF contacts you, you pretend to support the revolution, and then the French help you to escape ...
Sure. By shooting at me.
Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ...
I don't even know your name yet ...
But I haven't shot him.
You weren't able to. But what's important is that you tried.
What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.
C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.
I don't do that kind of thing.
Then don't complain.
You still haven't told me why you didn't let me kill him.
And how many are we?
Why? Isn't he sleeping here?
It's better to split up, to increase our chances. We must change hiding places, and change them continually ... In the meantime, we must make new contacts, replace our arrested brothers, reorganize our sections--
Yes, but we must also show them that we still exist.
Of course. As soon as possible.
No, immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me ...
Go away!
Can you read?
Read it.
Where's Kader?
With the others. They are trying to stop the people.
Be careful now. Unless you know how it works, it's better if you sit on the plank and move forward like this ...
It's good nobody is following us ...
What do you think of the strike, Ali?
I think it'll be a success ...
It's clear. They'll do everything possible to make it fail.
No ...
But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike.
No, and neither were my men.
Why?
Because they told us that we mustn't use weapons, now, when the time is right.
That's true ... Wars aren't won with terrorism, neither wars nor revolutions. Terrorism is a beginning but afterward, all the people must act ... This is the reason for the strike, and its necessity: to mobilize all Algerians, count them and measure their strength ...
To show them to the UN, right?
Good evening ... Can we pass?
It's too late. No one is allowed to enter the Casbah at this hour. It's impossible.
But it's not even midnight yet!
It's ten minutes past midnight. Curfew begins at midnight.
Please, we just want to take a short ride. A friend of mine has never seen the Casbah.
Where were we?
Good, thank you, Corbiere... . See you tomorrow.
Tell me ... Where is this rue de Thèbes?
Rue de Thèbes? In the Upper Casbah, I think ...
All right. See you tomorrow, Corbiere.
Mathieu! Mathieu, a name ...
A name?
And so the tapeworm no longer has a head. Are you satisfied, Mathieu? In Algiers everything should be over.
Yes, I believe there won't be any more talk of the NLF for some time.
Bah, for that matter, Algeria isn't the only country in the world ...
Why?
You seem to be very satisfied to have taken me alive ...
Of course I am.
That proves that I was wrong. Evidently I credited you with an advantage greater than I should have.
What is she saying?
Who is speaking?
Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu.
Okay. But we want your promise for a fair trial in writing. Give us a written statement, Mathieu, and then we'll surrender.
How can I give you this statement?
We'll lower a basket from the window ...
Are you ready, colonel?
How you doin' Mister D?
Yeah -- I hear they had 'em a real dog and pony show going on up there - - I'll tell you, sometimes white people are a real puzzle to me. I mean, did this old guy really think he was gonna be able to keep up with a sweet little number like that?
It could've happened to anyone.
We have to find out who else would profit from Marsh's death -- and who knew enough about his personal life to know that putting cocaine in the nasal spray would be fatal.
So -- where do we start?
Before you ask there's nothing new on the coke.
You've got to get me something I can use, Charlie.
I've been waiting for you to get back.
You got something on the coke?
I would have missed it -- but the phone rang and I let it play while I talked. It looks like blank tape -- but it isn't. It's been erased without any input signal coming in.
So, what good is it to us if it's been erased?
It's very good -- because when the D.A's office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape, otherwise they would have buried it.
Why?
I'm sorry to barge in -- but I figured after that bombshell that got laid on you today you could use some good news?
Charlie -- are you going to make a point soon?
Joanne Braslow is getting more and more interesting. I followed her today to an attorney's office. Joseph Koehler.
Joe Koehler. I know him. He's an estate attorney -- and he's very expensive.
Here it is! According to the old will Joanne Braslow was to inherit two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
What good does that do -- it's the old will?
Under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing. Since Rebecca Lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will, if she is found guilty the will is void and Joanne Braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated.
Take some time off.
You think the D.A.'s gonna file on Joanne?
You did a good job, Charlie.
I don't think that this is the time, or the place.
I just wanted to introduce myself and inform Miss Lawson that there will be an inquiry.
An inquiry into what?
For starters I'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death?
Because he wasn't dead when she left, and even if he was, not reporting a natural death in a timely fashion isn't a crime.
Marsh's Cardiologist told me that after Marsh was diagnosed with heart disease he quit smoking, quit drinking and started exercising every day. Does that sound like a guy who'd start shoveling cocaine up his nose?
What did he say about Miss Lawson?
So she knew about his heart?
Had to. I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh. There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.
What about the will?
I think I'm going to make your day.
Yeah.
About three hours.
Cause?
Marsh wasn't alone. We found traces of sperm on the sheets. The toxicology report says there were high levels of cocaine in his blood.
What'd he die of?
The official cause of death was a cardiac arrest.
The official cause?
That's what my report will read.
What are you saying, Henry? That his girlfriend fucked him to death?
What can we prove?
We know Marsh had a head cold. We found cocaine mixed with water in a nasal spray container on the nightstand. The coke would contract the nasal membrane the same as any decongestant, but for a much shorter time. He'd keep using more and more -- never knowing what he was taking.
Cocaine is the last thing a man in his condition would want.
Doctor McCurdy, what was the cause of death?
A massive cardiac arrest.
What was Mr. Marsh's physical condition prior to his death?
Very poor. He was suffering from severe arterial disease.
Was the heart attack the result of natural causes?
No.
What induced it?
We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.
So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?
I don't think so. The membrane in his nasal passage didn't show any sign of long time usage.
Then how did it get into his body?
Is this the bottle that was found on the nightstand?
Yes.
Your Honor, the State enters this evidence as exhibit A. Were any fingerprints found on the bottle?
Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb print of Miss Lawson's.
Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?
Increase his heart rate.
-- And if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine?
It would be an added stress to his heart.
What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love?
It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.
Mrs. Crawford, you were Mr. Marsh's maid for nine years?
Yes.
Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever argue?
Like cats and dogs.
What did they argue about?
You name it -- they argued about it. Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.
Did they argue the day before he died?
Well -- he died on a Sunday and I have the weekends off -- but they were ripping at each other with both barrels Friday afternoon.
What was the nature of the argument?
Sex.
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use cocaine?
No -- never.
Your Honor, Mr. Roston is an ex-lover of Miss Lawson's.
Why didn't the State's investigation uncover Mr. Roston earlier?
He was away on an extended vacation and just returned two days ago.
Objection sustained.
No questions.
Objection, Your Honor.
That's it. My client doesn't have to take this crap from you.
Sit down, Frank.
Lookin' to make the papers, John?
Marsh left her close to three million dollars in his will. That's motive. She admits to being there the night of his death. That's opportunity -- and her fingerprints are on the nasal spray bottle.
Can you?
Take your pole out of the water, Frank. The fish ain't biting today.
C'mon -- think about it. If she was going to kill Marsh why leave the nasal spray bottle there for the police to find?
She planned this. She wanted us to find the nasal spray.
Why would she want that?
Because she's clever. Because she knows that even if we didn't find it we'd have suspicions as to why a man in Marsh's condition would use cocaine.
Suspicions maybe -- but suspicions aren't enough for a conviction.
The M.E.'s report stated that Marsh's nasal membranes showed no sign of prior cocaine use. Without the nasal spray we would have still treated it as a poisoning. We would have looked for motive and the trail would have still led back to her.
I don't buy it and neither will a jury.
We're going all the way on this one, Frank. Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.
I'll tell her but she won't take it.
She's innocent.
Aren't they all?
Your Honor, this is a tape from Miss Lawson's answering machine. I would like to play it now.
Your Honor, I fail to see what Mrs Crawford's educational background has to do with this case.
Objection, Your Honor. The fact that Mrs. Crawford heard Mr. Troxell reconstruct her sentence and decided to rephrase her words in a more intelligent manner for the court doesn't mean the incident never happened.
I'm just curious to see if Mr. Troxell reconstructed anything else.
I've got work to do.
Hey -- the bell's sounded. It's between rounds.
What's happening to you, Frank? You're acting like you're on trial here. This has become personal to you.
That's ridiculous.
I'm talking to you as a friend now. Don't ruin your life, your career for her. She'll spit you out when this is over.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Really? What does an attorney speak to his client about at her house until three o'clock in the morning?
You've been following me?
Your Honor, I don't see a Mr. Roston listed as a prosecution witness.
Objection. The question calls for a conclusion on the part of the witness.
Your Honor, Mr. Roston lived with the defendant for many months. I feel that his opinion is valid in substantiating the character of the Miss Lawson.
Objection!
I'll rephrase the question. Mr. Roston isn't it true you are bisexual?
Objection! Mr. Roston's sexual preferences are not at issue in this trial.
Objection! May I remind Mr. Dulaney that the person on trial here is Miss Lawson -- not Dr. Paley.
Can I go?
Miss Lawson, do you use cocaine?
I have.
Did you use it the night Marsh died?
Were you aware of Mr. Marsh's heart condition?
No.
Mr. Marsh's Cardiologist and his nurse have told us that you accompanied Mr. Marsh to their office on at least two occasions.
Miss Braslow -- I'm District Attorney John Cardenas. You arrived at what time tonight?
A little after eleven.
Why did you come by?
I had some papers to pick up.
Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?
Her name?
Rebecca Lawson.
You wouldn't know her address, would you?
No -- but I can get it for you.
How long were you Mr Marsh's personal secretary?
Six years.
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use Cocaine?
No -- never.
What about Miss Lawson?
Yes.
Tell the court about that, please.
I opened the bathroom door one day and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine out of a vial.
Did you see Mr. Marsh the day before his death?
Yes.
How did he look?
Horrible. He was tired and pale.
Did you talk about Miss Lawson?
Yes.
Is it Marsh?
Who found him?
His Secretary. Joanne Braslow.
She was here?
No. She stopped by to pick up some papers.
Doctor Trammel, when did you first diagnose that Mr. Marsh had heart disease?
About a year and half ago.
Did Mr. Marsh change his lifestyle after that?
Yes -- he stopped smoking and drinking and exercised regularly.
He did everything he could to take care of his heart?
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh to your office?
Yes.
Just one last question. What does the sign on your office door say?
Mr. Roston, what was your relationship with Miss Lawson?
We were lovers.
How long were you together?
For about one year.
How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson?
Intense.
I know this is a very personal subject, but could you be a little more specific?
It was wild. She was constantly trying to get me more and more worked up -- kinky things. I tried to satisfy her the best I could, but it was difficult in my condition.
What kind of condition are you referring to?
What happened next?
I had bypass surgery.
And how are you now?
Fine. The doctors say if I keep taking care of myself I can live to be a very old man.
How did your relationship with Miss Lawson progress after the surgery?
It didn't.
Why not?
Why did she say she was leaving?
She didn't. She just left.
Why do you think she left you?
When you say your sexual relations with Miss Lawson were intense what exactly do you mean?
It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could. She called it opening new doors.
Can you give the court an example?
It's hard to resist a woman as beautiful as she is.
What would she do that made it hard to resist?
She told me that tonight we were going to open new doors. I asked her to stop -- to take off the handcuffs, but she wouldn't listen.
Mr. Roston I know this is difficult for you, but it's important you tell the court what she did.
What did she do next, Mr. Roston?
She started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me. She reached down and put me inside her. My doctor had warned me about exerting myself -- but you really don't think of those things at a moment like that. You just think about how beautiful this woman is -- how much you want her. How deeply you want to please her.
If you knew it was bad for you why did you do it?
I couldn't help myself. You get lost inside a women like her. It was like a drug. It was the best sex I ever had.
What happened after that?
I woke up the next morning and she was gone.
Yes.
Who was your primary beneficiary?
She was.
Where did you meet Miss Lawson?
At a dinner party -- about eight months ago.
Did you ever see her again after that?
Yes -- several times.
What eventually happened to your relationship with Miss Lawson?
We stopped seeing each other.
Why?
What kind of information?
Did you suggest any?
Yes -- Insulin and others.
What did she say?
She said that those weren't any good -- because their use would be detected and the police would know the victim had been poisoned. She wanted to know if there was a drug that would induce a heart attack but could also be used to enhance a sexual high.
-- And what did you suggest?
Dr. Paley, where were you the last time you saw Miss Lawson?
Isn't it true that later that night you tried to force yourself on Miss Lawson in the parking lot?
No.
You didn't grab her and try to kiss her?
No.
Well -- as I remember it, we had an argument.
And the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not.
Yes.
And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson?
You'll be sorry?
I was angry.
You're still angry, aren't you? Isn't it true that your whole story is nothing more than a vindictive attempt on your behalf to get back at Miss Lawson?
No -- she asked me about cocaine.
You can suggest anything you want. It happened.
I may have been infatuated with her - - but I wouldn't perjure myself.
Don't you see what she's doing? She needs you to kill me. She's planned it that way from the start. That's why she phoned me tonight.
I'm sure that every orgasm she had with me was faked.
That's enough.
Dr. Trammel, did you ever speak to Miss Lawson about Mr. Marsh's condition?
No.
Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to Miss Lawson about his illness?
No.
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh inside during his examinations?
No.
Then you have no way of knowing what Mr. Marsh told Miss Lawson were the reasons for his visits?
Dr. Wong -- what type of medicine do you practice?
Oriental medicine.
--And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours?
Yes. I've been seeing her for over a year.
Why does she come to you?
Did you ever prescribe any medication for her cramps?
Yes.
What did you prescribe for her?
Chinese peony root.
Would you describe for the court what Chinese peony root looks like?
How do you instruct your patients to take it?
I tell them to pour an amount the size of a quarter into the their hand and mix it with water.
October twenty-seventh.
One last question, Doctor. If someone didn't know better, would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine?
Did you go to college, Mrs. Crawford?
No.
High school?
I heard him say it.
Then -- those are not your own words?
No.
Miss Sellers, do you know Dr. Alan Paley?
Yes.
Where did you meet him?
I'm a nurse. I used to work at Roseburg Memorial Hospital. Dr. Paley's on staff there.
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
We dated for about a month last year.
Then what happened?
-- And what did Dr. Paley do after you stopped seeing him?
He used to call me -- tell me that I couldn't just walk out on him. He said that if I didn't come back he'd make my life miserable.
Did he make your life miserable?
Yes -- he did.
What did he say?
He laughed -- and basically said he would decide when it was over.
What happened next?
While I was seeing Dr. Paley I mentioned to him one night that someone was stealing drugs from the third floor dispensary. Three days after I spoke to him in his office he went to the Head Nurse and told her he had witnessed me stealing drugs.
What happened?
I worked for Mr. Marsh for six years. He was a good man -- until she came along.
What changed?
You don't really believe what the district attorney is saying about Miss Lawson, do you?
I don't know. It's incredible to think that anyone could be capable of doing that -- but if anyone could it would be Rebecca.
I take it you don't like Miss Lawson very much?
I really don't know her that well. We would say hello to each other when I would come to the house, but that was about it.
If you don't know her that well what makes you think she's capable of murder?
How do you know what kind of sex they had?
I wasn't lookin' through the keyhole if that's what you're thinking. I'd come to house sometimes to pick up papers or speak to Andrew. I'd find their little toys all over the place.
Did Mr. Marsh use drugs?
No.
What about Miss Lawson?
How do you know that?
How do you know it was cocaine that Miss Lawson had in the bathroom?
What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?
Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom?
Yes-- It was on a Friday. I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday. It would be October twenty-eighth.
Could you repeat the last part of what Mr. Marsh said to you the day before his death?
He said that if it kept up she was going to kill him. That his heart couldn't take it.
Yes -- he mentioned it.
So, the woman he loved passionately was thinking about leaving. That must cause tremendous anxiety. Sleepless nights. Incredible stress.
I suppose.
I don't know. I'm not sure.
Well, think about it. Isn't it possible?
Who told you that?
He video taped you.
That bastard!
Yes, I slept with him but that was a long time ago.
Yes.
It must have been horrible. Having to go there -- seeing them together - - knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you.
I'm a practical woman Mr. Dulaney. Killing Andrew wasn't in my best interest. As it is I'm out of a job and I'm not in his will.
I've tried it.
I've been to a few -- yes.
You don't like Miss Lawson much do you?
No.
You don't like her because you were involved with Mr. Marsh before she came along. Isn't that true?
Yes.
You resented the fact that she told you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?
And you resented that he cared for her in a way he once cared for you?
Yes.
--And that Mr. Marsh paid less attention to you?
Yes.
--and that he changed his will?
In his previous will Mr. Marsh left you two hundred and fifty thousand dollars -- then he cut you out. Why do you think he did that?
She talked him into it. She wanted everything.
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money. That must have made you pretty angry?
Yes.
Well - I'm a little confused. This is a charge receipt from Rosen's Drug Store where Mr. Marsh had an account. It's dated the day of the murder. Is this your signature?
Yes.
There's an item you picked up that's marked. Will you read it?
Dristan nasal spray.
Would you read for us the time of the purchase?
Three fifteen.
A.M -- or P.M.?
P.M.
You see that's what bothers me. No other bottle of nasal spray was found in the house. The police looked. There was only the one bottle. But you say you didn't arrive until after Mr. Marsh was dead -- yet we know he was using the nasal spray prior to his death. How do you think it got there?
Isn't it true that you stopped by the house after you left the drug store and dropped off the items you bought?
No.
Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?
No! Why would I want to kill him?
You take what people say and make it ugly. You make others believe what you want them to. She should have been found guilty. She shouldn't have gotten off.
Then you would have gotten your money?
Yes.
What do you have in your purse?
I'm gonna go to jail. I know they're gonna make it look like I did it. They gotta put it on someone.
Why'd you come here?
To show you this. It's a letter from that lawyer, Koehler. He wrote it to me the day after I saw him. He's the one who told me I could get the money if Miss Lawson went to jail.
You didn't know about it before that?
Then why did you go see Mr. Koehler in the first place?
Hi, Joe.
Frank -- what are you doing here?
I need to ask you a question. What made you get in touch with Joanne Braslow?
You know I can't talk about that.
I'm not asking for names or specifics. I just want to know what prompted you to make the call?
Yes.
And your sexual tastes were something that you hid from Miss Lawson?
Yes.
And didn't Miss Lawson come home one day and find you in bed with your male lover?
Yes.
Would it be fair to say that when she did find out it was a shock to her?
Yes.
Are you going to represent me?
Do you think I did it?
I don't know. That's why I'm asking you.
You must have some feeling. Some immediate impression. A young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will. And the things that went on in that house. Such wild sex. What kind of picture does that paint?
And that's exactly what the jury will see when they look at me. That's why I need a very good lawyer, Mr. Dulaney.
He'll file. He's an ambitious man. Ambitious men build their careers on the bodies of others.
Frank!
I want you to know right now that the trial's going to be nasty. Your sex life is going to be dragged through the mud. They're going to say that you enticed Marsh -- led him down a dark path.
Andrew hardly needed leading. He was a very passionate man. He was eager to explore. I gave him what he wanted. We fulfilled each others needs.
I'm used to being on the outside looking in. The same men who will publicly profess their moral outrage for my sexual tastes are the same ones who privately rest their sweaty little hands on my legs and talk about weekend trips together.
Those same men will be sitting on the jury.
Have you ever seen animals make love, Mr. Dulaney? They have such passion -- such savage emotion. They struggle, and snarl, and claw, but neither hurts the other. Not really.
No pain, no gain?
Something like that.
I think we're getting a little off the subject here.
I thought the subject was sex?
As it pertains to you -- not me. Did you always know you had different... tastes?
Yes.
How?
I don't know if it's something I can explain to you.
Why not?
Because -- it's beyond intellect. It's emotion. It's passion. It has to be experienced -- it can't be imagined.
When I was growing up we had a strawberry patch in our backyard. So did this family down the road. I used to sneak in their yard and steal their strawberries. It wasn't easy. The stone walls were high and I'd scrape my knees as I climbed over. On the other side were wild rose bushes. The thorns would dig into my legs and
If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?
How'd you meet Marsh?
-- And then?
We started talking. In fact, we talked until four in the morning. We discovered we shared a lot of the same interests. After that we were together all the time until he left. He used to call me every night after he came back. Then after a few weeks he invited me to come visit him. I've never left.
Can we get out of here?
This is your house.
Why not?
Because, I'm your attorney. I shouldn't be going to your house.
Is it against the law?
What do you think?
I think the photographer's probably a voyeur.
I'm the photographer.
Oh -- Well, they're different.
That's not an answer.
It's not my taste.
Nothing.
Hello?
Hi. It's Frank.
Hi, Frank.
I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
Yes -- she did.
Great. I'll see you at the office at nine.
Yeah.
Sorry.
Tell me about Doctor Paley?
I hardly know him. He wanted me and he couldn't have me.
It's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off.
Did you always want to be a lawyer?
No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player.
Really?
Yeah.
That seems so far away from who you are now. What happened?
I broke my ankle skating. That ended that dream.
Yes -- it would be nice.
What would?
You and me -- making love.
Is that what you think I was thinking?
There's nothing wrong in admitting that you want me, Frank.
You lied to me!
What?
I just left Joanne Braslow. She told me she saw you doing cocaine at Marsh's house!
She's mistaken.
That's not good enough, Goddamit!
It isn't true. You have to believe me.
No, I don't have to believe you. The jury has to believe you and answers like he's lying or she's mistaken aren't going to convince them.
I don't use cocaine anymore. If she says she saw me doing it she's lying.
Why would she lie?
I called you all weekend. Where were you?
Alone?
You were brilliant today.
Can I see you later?
Something wrong?
I'm sure you'll be able to handle him.
I'm glad you have such confidence in me.
Don't worry about Paley. He can't touch me. No one can. I've thought it all out.
Sugar or honey?
Rebecca -- take these off.
What are you going you doing?
What's that for?
To celebrate how masterfully you destroyed Roston today.
Rebecca -- we shattered a man's life in open court.
Fuck him! He tried to shatter mine.
He was only doing what he thought was right.
You killed him -- didn't you?
I knew you were thinking that. I could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom. You're wrong, Frank. I need you to believe that.
You don't need anybody.
I'm dropping the case.
You can think whatever you want, Frank -- but I didn't kill Andrew, and I'm not going to prison for something I didn't do.
You're a monster.
Hello?
You killed him. You killed him -- and I got you off.
I've been thinking about that. I've decided to give it to you after I've collected the inheritance. You can take that one if you want -- but there's another copy.
That wasn't the deal.
So, sue me. Things have changed. I think you should go home -- and after you leave I see no reason for us to ever have contact again.
I'm not leaving without that tape.
She's right, Paley. You've got to kill me. She doesn't have to -- she's free -- she can't be tried again -- but you, you planned it with her. You supplied the Coke. You're an accessory to murder.
No -- he's lying.
How's it supposed to work Rebecca? You and Paley celebrate your victory. You get me over here and provoke a fight so he has to rush in and save you -- but then he's given himself away as your accomplice -- now he has to kill me. After that I figure she'll tell the Police that you broke in. That you were crazed because
Andrew Marsh was a very wealthy man. A trial like this is going to put Cardenas in the spot-light.
We've already got press arriving from over the country and she hasn't even been charged yet. Cardenas wants to see her in his office tomorrow at ten. I'd like you to go with her.
I know -- but she wants you to represent her if Cardenas files.
Why?
Because I told her you were the best criminal attorney we have.
Raymond, I'm the only criminal attorney you have.
Alright, I'll talk to her
What are they saying?
The kids at school say she humped Mr. Marsh to death.
Hey, you know better than that. What did I teach you to say when someone is accused of doing something?
You know how it is sometimes when you're out playing ball with your friends? How you're really concentrating on what you're doing -- and you lose track of time and you come home late and Mom yells at you?
Yeah.
Well, that's kind of how I am right now.
I love you.
Michael -- get off the phone.
Why?
Because I'm expecting a call.
-- But it's Sunday.
I know what day it is! Get off the phone.
Do it quickly, Mr. Dulaney.
Mr. Dulaney, before you cast aspersions on the District Attorney's Office by suggesting they've coaxed this witness to say things that aren't true -- you better have more than a hunch. Do you?
No, Your Honor.
But Your Honor--
Objection. The witness has already stated that Miss Lawson left without an explanation.
The witness will answer the question.
Miss Braslow, I'd like to remind you that you are still under oath.
Your Honor -- the prosecution has introduced cocaine as one of the contributing reasons Mr. Marsh died. How it may have been introduced into the household is of vital importance.
Are you able to back up this allegation -- or are you fishing?
I can back it up.
You're on vacation, remember? You're supposed to be relaxing.
I am relaxing.
This is not relaxing.
Really?
Really.
And I suppose you're going to show me how to relax?
If you want me to.
Can't it wait?
Hello?... Hi Raymond.... What?... Well, I was sort of planning on... Alright... Okay, goodbye. That was Sattler. He thinks the D.A.'s going to file on Rebecca Lawson. He wants me in the office tomorrow morning.
We're supposed to go to the lake.
I know. What can I do? He is the boss.
I swear -- the both of you. Some example you set.
How can Cardenas possibly think he can build a case against two consenting adults?
He must have something or he wouldn't be pressing so hard.
If he files are you going to take the case?
I don't know yet. I want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow.
What's she like?
She sounds like quite a woman.
Humped
Yes.
Frank -- I know you're busy, but Michael asked me after dinner if you were angry with him. He wanted to know why you weren't talking to him.
I'll talk to him later.
Why don't you talk to him now?
Because I go to trial in seven weeks. I've got a lot of preparing to do.
Is that alright, Frank?
Yeah -- what are you doing up?
We have to talk.
What's wrong?
Sharon, it's late. Can we get to the point?
Working. Charlie and I were going over some statements.
Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you. You were with her, weren't you?
Yes.
Why did you lie to me?
This isn't a courtroom. Don't try to turn this around on me.
I'm not.
You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
No.
I was thinking that when the trial is over we'd all go skiing for a weekend.
I know.
You wouldn't like what you'd see. You don't know me anymore. I don't know me anymore.
We can't pretend this isn't happening.
Please -- not now.
Why didn't you come to me?
I don't know.
You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me.
It's more involved than that.
It was a place to start.
You think that's the answer? Sex? Is that what you want? You want me to make love to you?
Frank -- stop it! Stop it!
Albert's got the stomach flu.
That's too bad.
No, it's not. Now I get to pitch.
Michael, you shouldn't be happy when someone else isn't feeling well.
Not even if they're a dork?
Don't use language like that at the dinner table.
Let me go! Godammit, Frank let go!
I didn't know that Andrew was dead until Mr. Sattler called me at home that night.
Yes.
What time did you leave?
Did Marsh use it?
No -- never.
It had to get there somehow.
No, we just had lunch at the hotel with my brother and his new wife. She told me all the dirt. I forgot how interesting things can get around here. It was so good to see them. The last time we visited they were in Europe. He is doing so well. He ordered champagne. For lunch! I nearly died.
I nearly died when we split the bill.
Michael doesn't understand. People who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. They keep it all in various accounts.
Boy. It sure has been a long time.
We were here two Christmases ago.
Well, that's a long time.
It's not that long.
Well, why don't I just say black so you can say white! Don't be surprised to find your brother hasn't changed an iota. He hardly ever talks and when he does it's in that tone! You should have heard him at lunch -- not two words until the bill came and then he says, "Worth every penny."
SO!
You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!
Oh Jesus.
My Jewish friend's grandmother did.
Not to mention people driving over her and doggies doing their business --
We're not doing it! I'm not even sure it's Christian.
Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
It's a beautiful picture of her.
I don't mind waiting.
Well, there's a lot of boring stuff to do. Lists of people we have to write to. Find mama's relatives addresses in Italy -- stuff like that.
Well, I can help.
I am so sick and tired of apologizing and not knowing what I've done!
Eeeww!
How bizarre!
Oh, just a old letter from a friend.
No treasure maps, huh?
I do not need instructions from you to bathe! I knew you'd do this! I knew I'd come all the way here and be shut out as usual! I came to be here for you! I didn't have to come! Lord knows I was never much welcome in this house before. Apparently dead or alive, nothing's changed.
Carolyn -- you want these candlesticks?
Explain to me again why we didn't do this in Des Moines in an air conditioned office?
Mom's orders.
Lawyer here?
He dropped them off at Betty's mom. Where's Steve?
I thought everything WAS arranged.
Well, there's a problem.
I remember a Mrs. Delaney but Mama told me years ago she died.
Yeah.
Michael.
What?!
"-- going over and over in my mind every detail, every moment of our time together and I ask myself, "What happened to me in Madison County?" I struggle to put it together in a way that allows me to continue knowing we're on separate roads. But then I look through the lens of my camera, and you're there. I start to write an
What's he saying now?
Well, he just gets on about how if mama ever needed him, she could find him through the National Geographic magazine. He as a photographer. He promises not to write again. Then all it says is... I love you... Robert.
Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.
That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is. From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested...
What?
That he be cremated and his ashes thrown on Roseman Bridge.
DAMN HIM! I knew mama wouldn't have thought of that herself. It was some damn perverted... photographic mind influencing her! When did the bastard die?
'82.
Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?
I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.
My Lord. It must feel real nice living inside your head with Peter Pan and the Easter Bunny.
Don't talk to me like that. She was my mother for Christsakes. And now I find out she was... She was a --!
Don't say that!
Well, what am I supposed to think?
I can't believe she never told me? We spoke at least once a week. How could she do that?
How did she meet him? Did Dad know? Anything else in that envelope?
I can't believe she's making jokes.
Grateful!?
"... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever
What are you doing?
This is crazy. She waits till she's dead to tell us all this. Well, I got news for you. She was my mother. That's enough for me. I don't have to know who she was.
Well, I'd like to read them.
No. We're going to lock this up and --
He's getting her drunk. That's what happened. Jesus, maybe he forced himself. That's why she couldn't tell us.
Oh, he did not. He's such a nice guy.
Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
I had no idea it's gotten that bad, sis.
Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay.
Then why do you?
Bar across the street.
Have you called Betty? Maybe you should.
I found out who Lucy Delaney is. Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?
Yeah. But I thought she died.
He remarried. Apparently they were having an affair for years. Apparently the first Mrs. Delaney was a bit of a stiff.
You mean -- she didn't like sex?
I bet mom could've helped her.
Boy. All these years I've resented not living the wild life in some place like Paris and all the time I could've moved back to Iowa... Are you drunk?
Not yet. You want to go?
I used to love this place. I used to take Kathy Reynolds down here.
You never dated Kathy Reynolds!
Not officially. Her and Steve Kendall were pinned at birth. But I was crazy about her. And for about three months, I managed to catch her during her "exploring" stage.
I never knew that.
Nobody did.
Was this during Betty?
Everything was during Betty. God we were so young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I've never cheated on Betty. Not once we were married, I mean.
Did we want to?
Only about a thousand times. What do I do now? "What's good enough for mom is good enough for me?"
What gets me is I'm 46 years old. I've been in this crummy fucking marriage -
Carolyn!
-- for over twenty years because that's what I was taught -- you stick with it! Normal people don't get divorced. I can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite frankly, I don't think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my mother
What about me! I feel really weird. Like she cheated on me, not dad. Isn't that sick? I don't mean I wanted to sleep with her or anything but -- ya know -- being the only son. You're sort of made to feel like you're the prince of the kingdom, ya know? And in the back of your mind, you kind of think your
Mrs. Delaney. Did you hear the latest?
See. Money don't buy happiness. I must say, she's taking it well.
I'd kill him. Him and that Redfield woman. Together. First one then the other. And then I'd laugh.
She's changed.
Oh, yes.
My niece had "the changes" when she was thirty-one.
No. What a tragedy. What happened?
Oh, this heat! Times like this I wish we took that offer from your brother and moved on up to Michigan.
They got heat in Michigan.
Not this kind of heat.
Heat is heat.
Heat is not heat! There's different kinds! And this heat is much hotter than what they got in Michigan. You go and call your brother and see if he don't say the same thing.
Well, nobody put a gun to his head.
What do you know about "the changes"?
Well, I didn't know they was a secret club.
Madge?
Madge. Please. Something's happened. I've met someone. I've fallen in love in a way I've never thought could happen my entire life. It's our last day together. I feel like I'm going to die when he leaves. Please. Help me.
I don't know. I woke up a little dizzy. I didn't sleep well. I think I need to lay down.
You want me to call the doctor?
No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?
No, of course not. I'll just clean up.
No, leave it. I'll do it later. Listen, maybe you and Floyd can come for dinner on Saturday. I'm sure Richard'll have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all.
Are you supposed to be in Iowa?
Roseman Bridge?
That's it.
Well, you're pretty close. It's only about two miles from here.
If I'm not taking you away from anything.
Pretty country.
There's a wonderful smell about Iowa -- very particular to this part of the country. Do you know what I mean?
No.
I can't describe it. I think it's from the loam in the soil. This very rich, earthy kind of... alive... No. No, that's not right. Can you smell it?
Maybe it's because I live here.
Are you from Washington originally?
Uh-huh. Lived there till I was twenty or so and then moved to Chicago when I got married.
Oh. When did you move back?
After the divorce.
Oh.
How long you been married?
Uh... uh... Umm... long time.
You don't look like a native, if you don't mind my saying so.
No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.
Well, from Italy to Iowa -- that's a story! Whereabouts in Italy?
Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari.
Oh yeah, Bari. I've been there.
No, really?
You just... got off the train because it looked pretty?
So, how long you've been living here?
Long. You just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there?
This won't take long. I'm shooting tomorrow morning. I just need to do some prep work.
This time of year.
Oh there you are.
Men sill give women flowers, don't they? I mean, as a sign of appreciation? I'm not that out of date, am I?
No, not at all -- except those are poisonous.
Are you by nature a sadistic person?
Looking for something in particular? There's not much of a selection.
Oh, that's nice.
Want another cigarette?
Well, thank you for all your help, Mrs. Johnson.
Francesca.
Lemon?
Mind if I smoke?
Sure you want to keep those in the house?
I'm so sorry about that. It was rude. I think I just got nervous for some reason.
Where are you staying while you're here?
A little place with cabins. The something-Motor Inn. I haven't checked in yet.
And how long are you here for?
As long as it takes, I might stay a week. No more I don't think. Where's your family?
My husband took the kids to the Illinos State Fair. My daughter's entering a prize steer.
Oh. How old?
About a year and a half.
No, your kids.
Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
Everything does. One of the laws of nature. People are always so afraid of change. But if you look at it like it's something you can count on happening, it's actually a comfort. Not many things you can count on for sure.
I guess. Except I'm one of the people it frightens.
I doubt that.
Why?
Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a change.
Richard was in the army. I met him while I was living in Naples. I didn't know where Iowa was. I only cared that it was America. And of course, being with Richard.
He's very... clean.
Clean?
No. I mean yes, he's clean but he's also other things. He's a very hard worker. Very honest. Very caring. Gentle. Good father.
And clean.
Feeling better?
Much.
Is the dizziness gone?
I better go. You sure you're all right? It's been a pleasure. Sincerely.
I feel so embarrassed.
Why? You uncorked a bottle. From what I can tell, I got here just in time. Any later and you'd have made the front page, running down Main Street naked, smoking Camels out of your butt.
But I... We don't even know each other.
Would you like to stay for dinner? There aren't many choices in town and ... anyway, you'd have to eat alone. So would I.
Help cook?
Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.
What?
She starts sniffing me.
Oh my God... You're blushing.
It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
Then what happened?
We got engaged.
You ought to write these stories down.
Nah. I've tried. My writing's too technical, I think. Problem of being a journalist too long is you stop giving yourself permission to invent. I better just stick to making pictures.
"Making pictures." I like that. You really love what you do, don't you?
I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually.
Why, do you think?
I don't know if obsessions have reasons. I think that's why they're obsessions.
You sound like an artist.
No. I wouldn't say that. National Geographic isn't exactly the hub of artistic inspiration. They like their wild life in focus and without any personal comment. I don't mind really. I'm not artist. I'd faced that a long time ago. It's the course of being well-adjusted. I'm too normal.
I didn't mean that the way it sounded.
And did you?
I'd like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school.
Why did you stop?
My children. And Richard didn't like my working.
Do you miss it?
I don't know. I've never thought about it... what was the most exciting place you've ever been to? Unless you're tired of talking about it.
I'm sorry. That was...
No. It's all right. I just meant, it might be a little dull for you, telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere.
My God. How I'd love to see that.
Well, it's kind of buggy out there.
Have no fear. This Shoshone Medicine Woman taught me how to make bug repellent tea out of tree root.
You drink bug repellent?
Smells like dirt.
You get used to it.
When?
You want to go back in?
You've got it all right here, you know. It's just as beautiful as any other place I've seen. God, it knocks me out.
What?
This "... Of what I call God and fools can Nature." Who wrote that?
Umm, I don't know. I can look it up.
You sure you won't let me help you with those dishes?
No. I'll do them later.
Francesca?
What?
Are you all right?
Yes.
Francesca?
What?
Do you mind if I... ask you why you got divorced?
Not at all. I wasn't around much... So why did I get married? Well, I thought it was a good idea at the time. Have a home base. Roots. You can get lost moving around so much.
So what happened?
I never got lost. For some reason, I'm more at home everywhere than at one place. So I decided I'll think of myself as some kind of world citizen. I belong everywhere and nowhere. I'm kin to everyone, and no one in particular. See, once you get into the habit of not needing anyone, it's kind of hard to break.
You must get lonely at times.
Never touch the stuff. I've got friends all over the world. Good friends I can see when I want, if I want.
Woman friends, too?
You really don't need anyone?
No, I think I need everyone! I love people. I want to meet them all! I just think there are too many out there saying "This is mine." or "She's mine." Too many lines have been drawn. World's breaking apart because of man's weakness for some testosterone conquests over territory and power and people. He wants control over what deep down he knows he
Why doesn't it scare you?
I embrace Mystery. I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind.
Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean.
No.
Do you ever regret not having a family?
Not everybody's supposed to have a family.
But -- how can you just live for what you want? What about other people?
I told you, I love other people.
But no one in particular.
No. But I love them just the same.
But it's not the same.
That's not what you're saying. I know it's not the same. What you're saying is, it's not as good. Or it's not as normal or proper.
No, I'm just saying --
I'm a little sick of this American Family Ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country. I guess you think I'm just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without a self-cleaning oven and home movie.
Just because someone chooses to settle down and have a family doesn't necessarily mean they're hypnotized. Just because I've never seen a gazelle stampede doesn't mean I'm asleep in the world.
My mistake. I apologize.
What made you ask such a question?
I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions.
I thought we were just having a conversation. You seem to be reading all this meaning into it. Meanings I must be too simple to, uh... interpret or something.
Listen, I'm sorry I --
No, no. Forgive me. I made a mistake. It was an inappropriate thing to ask.
Francesca?
Yes! Hi.
Am I interrupting anything?
No. I was just... No.
I'm sorry I didn't call sooner, but I just read your note. I stuffed it into my pocket. The light was fading and I had to get my shot.
The light was fading. Huh-huh.
I would love to come for dinner.
Wonderful. Uh...
Listen, I have to shoot Cedar Bridge until a little after sunset. I want a few night shots. Would you like to come with me? If you're interested...
Oh, sure. Great.
I'll pick you up.
No. I'll drive myself. I have a few errands. I'll meet you there.
Okay. See you later.
It's Robert.
Oh, hi. Look, I'm running a little late, but I'll still...
Oh.
I uh... I had lunch in town today. Happened to cross paths with "that Redfield woman." I apologize. I thought you were half-joking about that.
Oh. I guess you got the whole story.
The cashier at the general store was very dangerous.
I think he's running for town crier next year.
I now know more about their affair than I remember about my marriage. Francesca, the last thing I want to do is put you in any kind of situation that would... even though we know it's just -- I mean, it's nothing like that, but if anybody saw us or...
Yeah?
Sorry I'm late. Richard called.
Oh, how is he?
Fine. They're all having a good time. How many more shots do you have?
Can I help?
Actually, no. I've got everything under control. I'd like to clean up myself a bit. I'm going to take a bath. Dinner'll be ready in about a half hour.
How about if I set the table?
Sure.
Would you like a beer for your bath?
Are you comfortable? Do you... want to move to the bedroom?
You want to eat something?
Are you hungry?
Take me somewhere.
What?
Right now. Tell me someplace you've been -- someplace on the other side of the world. Anywhere but here.
How about Italy?
Yes.
How about Bari?
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.
Have you ever been to that station?
Yes.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I just feel like I'm getting a little ... out of control that's all. It's kind of frightening.
Why?
Why!? Because, I'm having thoughts I hardly know what to do with. I... can't seem to... stop them.
Nobody's asking you to.
And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!
I sat outside and had coffee.
Where? Near the doorway or the near the front of the church?
Near the church.
On that one is beautiful. Look at their expressions. As if the camera weren't on them at all. As if they had no strength left to hide what they were feeling.
He's a genius. They're not photographs -- they're stories, entire histories captured in moments.
I bet you could do a book.
No. I couldn't.
Why do you say that?
But you don't mind.
What were you like when you were younger?
Trouble. Why?
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?
I had a temper.
I can't do this, honey.
What?
You're somewhere else, where?
Just that it's been a perfect day and that I'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this.
Uh-huh. And?
Where was she?
I don't know why I'm so tired all of a sudden.
Long day. Go to sleep.
Am I too heavy for you?
Sleep all right?
Yes, thanks.
Good. More coffee? Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should.
What?
I... What do you want?
Well, I just want to know the procedure. I don't want to upset your routine. Do you want any jam?
Routine! I don't have a routine. And if you think that's what this is -
Well, what is this?
Well, why is that up to me? You're the one who's married. You told me you have no intention of leaving your husband.
To do what? Be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular? I mean, what would be the point. Would you pass the butter?
I was honest with you. I told you who I was.
What are you doing?
Gee, I don't know. I guess I'm not cut out to be a World Citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.
How do you know what I experience?
I know you! What can this possibly mean to anyone who doesn't "need" meaning - "Who goes with the Mystery" -- who pretends he isn't scared to death.
Stop it!
You have no idea what you've done to me, do you? And after you leave, I'm going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here. If anything happened at all! And I'll have to wonder if you find yourself in some... housewife's kitchen in Romania if you'll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and
What do you want me to say?
STOP IT!
Fine. More eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time?
I told you! I won't apologize for who I am.
No one's asking you to!
I won't be made to feel like I've done something wrong.
You won't be made to feel! Period. You've carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur, a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you've touched our lives! Well, go to hell! It isn't human not
I DON'T WANT TO NEED YOU!
WHY?
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
If I've done anything to make you think that what's happened between us is nothing new for me -- is some routine -- then I do apologize.
No matter how I keep turning it around in my mind -- it doesn't seem like the right thing.
For who?
For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life.
Then he can move! People move!
His family's lived for almost a hundred years. Richard doesn't know how to live anywhere else. And the kids...
The kids are grown! They don't need you anymore. You told me that. They hardly talk to you.
No, they don't say much. But Carolyn's 16. She's just about to find out about all this for herself -- she's going to fall in love, she's going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone. If I leave what does that say to her?
What about us? What about me?
You've got to know deep down that the minute we leave here. It'll all change.
Yeah. It could get better.
No matter how much distance we put between us and this house, I bring with it with me. And I'll feel it every minute we're together. And I'll blame loving you for how much it hurts. And then even these four days won't be anything more than something sordid and... a mistake.
Francesca, listen to me. You think what's happened to us happens to just anybody? What we feel for each other? How much we feel? We're not even two separate people anymore. Some people search their whole lives for it and wind up alone -- most people don't even think it exists and you're going to tell me that giving it up is the right
We are the choices we've made, Robert.
Robert. Please. You don't understand -- no one does. When a woman makes the choice to marry, to have children -- in one way her life begins but in another way it stops. You build a life of details. You become a mother, a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move. And when they leave they take your
But now that you have it -
I don't know. Please...
I'm going to be here a few more days. I'll be at the Inn. We have some time. Let's not say any more now.
No. Don't do this.
I CAN'T SAY GOODBYE YET! We'll leave it for now. We're not saying goodbye. We're not making any decision. Maybe you'll change your mind. Maybe we'll accidentally run into each other and ... and you'll change your mind.
Mrs. Johnson! Mrs. Johnson! Is it true Cary Grant has proposed to you?
Yes. And I've accepted.
What about his engagement to Dyan Cannon?
I said to him Cary you're being ridiculous. You're more than half her age. He said no one had ever been that honest with him and he falls in love with me.
What about your husband?
You feeling better Franny?
It's a Chicago station. I found it the other day.
Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
I don't know. Can we turn it off? I have such a headache.
'Bout 4:30.
What time is it?
Later. Go back to sleep.
Where you going?
I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt.
Now?! It's after eleven.
I can't sleep.
Again? Maybe you should see a doctor.
"I had forgotten this. I had somehow remembered it being more his fault, his decision. Then I remembered we made love in that field before we left for home. And I remembered it was my idea. I remembered tearing his shirt and biting his body, hoping he would kidnap me. I had forgotten that too. And I wondered, as I sat there... how many
I'm positive.
I'm going to miss you.
Want anything special for dinner?
Hmm. How about that brown sugar meat loaf you make?
Franny?
Hmm?
Are you seeing Betty tonight?
Okay.
What's her name?
Betty.
What's she like?
Uh... Yeah. Yeah. She's real nice.
Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!
Well, she's... she's real pretty and ... and she's got a cute shape... she's a good sport, ya know, for laughs and ... she loves fried chicken wings and beer.
Oh my God...!
What happened?
Think for a second. Is there someplace she said she wanted to go?
About an hour ago.
They're not going to find her!
Your mother left explicit instructions that she wished to be cremated.
When did she decide this?
Apparently just before her death.
It clearly states in the will --
I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.
Well, it was notarized, and witnessed by a Mrs. Lucy Delaney. Maybe you can ask her.
Don't feed that dog.
You people really don't like dogs.
Outta my way, boy. Cinnabar? I'm coming!
Why don't you hang on and I'll see if she's here.
We can't go back there. Are you crazy? You saw --
Your father was his best friend. He loved Jeremiah. So he must hate him the most of all now. He'll take his time. But even if it is too late. If your father is dead. It's not over. The door has to be closed.
Well, close the fucking door by all means. But don't expect me to go down there and do it.
Hey, watcha doing with that dog?
He yours, sir?
Hell no!
Then what do you care?
Take my advice. And shoot that dog. Or let me.
Is it true?
Yeah. He lived there. And died there, too.
Died there? How?
Hey, kid.
Yeah?
We practically paying him for the privilege of playing his club.
Bones! How baddass is zat? This is the place for us. Patrick, you get platinum props, man. Platinum.
Yeah, in the land of the blind the one eye'd are king.
What's your problem with Crippled Dick?
Are you nuts?
The man said just to use my imagination. Let's see...yeah, I get it. Potential. I can see it now. The first major urban theme park. Village Ghetto land. Kinda like Legoland, but made entirely from broken glass, hypodermic needles and crack vials. Totally E-ticket.
You didn't hear that? "Take him... " Something. "Bury him" or...
'S up?
Ugh. Muchos moscos, man. This is too much.
Just some flies.
Oh yeah, I guess this would be that space that was so perfect for a recording studio.
Boys and girls, Moms and Dads. Children of all ages, I'd like you to meet... Jimmy Bones.
What the hell you talking about?
You think that's really him?
...Bones ol' Bones so mean and bad, whupped his mamma, shot his dad.
Can you take a little extended solo right about now, funk soul brotha?
Looks like a damn graveyard round here.
Damn. That is the ugliest building I have ever seen.
You want us to move in here?
You soundin' like the old man now.
I believe in you guys. You are the real shit. And you know it. Now I'm putting everything I got into this cuz I think we can make it happen, but you gotta put a little in too. Now all I"m asking is that everybody do their part. We'll move some shit in, and take shifts, or all crash together here --
Tia ain't a chick. She's family. And don't forget it.
Shit.
No. Well, yeah. Maybe just a little.
Where's the others?
Yeah, we can. Least till after this weekend. He ain't going nowhere. We'll deal with it then.
You sure got a way with women, bro. What happened up there?
Where's the gangsta of love?
Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
You ain't going down there. Not alone. I'll go.
We can climb out.
Climb out to where?
Is this Hell?
Don't poison your mind with that ghetto paranoia. That's all just ways of people justifying their own failure.
Dad, the man has been lying to us for a hundred years. I mean, where is my forty acres and a mule?
That's what?
That's some terrible shit.
Clean your mouth, or I will. Those boys had no business messing down there. Go places you're not meant to be -- that's what you get.
But that's your old hood, Pops.
Looking to score?
Unh-unh, little brother. I got a natural high. A supernatural high.
Hey, Eddie Mack don't like no wackos on his street. Go be Rain Man on some other bitch's block.
You tell my old friend Mackie, I'll be seeing him. Soon. Real soon.
Wh-wh-whooo?
Yeah, we used to do the after-school b ball at Kenwood. What it is?
You got a nice crib here.
I do alright. Everybody's happy.
What else? Money.
It ain't the money - it's the high. The big fat floating 'what if?' And it's way more profitable. Nobody ever wins. So you never have to pay out.
But a two dollar bet is cheaper than a twenty-dollar bag.
Yeah, but I ain't talking horse. I'm talking about a five-dollar kick in the head that's a quick ticket to heaven. And the fools keep coming back for more.
Those 'fools' are my people.
I ain't interested. And if you gonna sell it, don't sell it round here.
Just try it.
I said, no thanks.
Maybe I oughtta get there a little early. For good luck.
Don't need luck tonight. I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no.
Let me see your hand.
All that shinin' and "reader and adviser" mess. That was your mama's bag. I don't know about the readin' but you both can sure 'nuff advise.
My mama's bag and my granma's bag, and a long line of mamas before her.
Left hand's the past. Your right's the present. And the future. But it's not written in stone. It's written in flesh and blood. And flesh and blood will change. See? There's something here, a new line, right across your life line.
Must be my clothes line. No? How bout my phone line?
No baby. I'm serious. Cancel that meeting. I got more fruit that needs checking. Come home with me now.
Gotta be an in-ey and gotta be smooth. If it's ragged, it was picked too soon. Won't ever be ripe. Second, it's got to have just a little give, here. At the edges. And last, but not very far from least... You gotta get your nose in it and give it a gooooood, looooong sniff.
No? That mean there's something more left of you than just that hungry spirit? What are you going to do now? Kill us? Kill us all?
Jimmy, you've got --
I want you to do something for me, baby.
Where are we, baby?
Where we'll always be...
But.
'Sup Jimmy B. Shotgun. Get back on the curb! Now!
It's all arranged for tonight. Eddie Mack's gonna be there. And Offisa Korruptsky, too.
They get about twelve and a half minutes. Tops.
Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this. Not just big. BIG. Like big business big. Big corporation big. Big government big. Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands. Nothing but net.
Nothing but net? Could be a swish. Or a muthafucking air ball.
One simple word, three little letters. Yes. That's all it's gonna take and we could move out of this dump, get the real deal. Big houses, legit business...
Hey Jimmy, you know Eddie Mack, don't you?
Everybody just be cool. Jimmy, man, I think you oughtta hear the deal.
Sorry, my brother.
Since we was just grasshoppers...
What it will be.
How did you get in here?
I don't understand it. You were my Man. Since we was grasshoppas. I always looked after you. You had a piece of everything I had.
I didn't want a piece of yours, I wanted my own.
Wait, Jimmy. Think about it. You woulda done the same thing if you was me.
What will it take? What do you want? Just tell me, Jimmy!
Aw that's easy. I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother?
You know I can't.
Aren't you going to join us?
I have to finish this for class.
You got a vision, girl. Just like I got. Just like my momma had. And the good Lord didn't give you that vision just for painting pretty pictures. That's just wasted time.
I'm sorry, Momma. Maybe next time.
I don't want you meeting around that house. You stay away from those kids. And away from that dog.
They seemed alright. Bring a little life to that old building.
Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there.
Have you ever been inside?
Maybe once upon a time. But that was long ago. Back before... before it became what it is.
And what's that?
...I've seen things. In there. Last night. You did too. Don't tell me you didn't. You were crying like a baby.
You said the vision, the images. They're just that. Just pictures. They can't hurt you. That's what you always said.
I lied.
All the more reason I should be here.
Please. It's for your own good.
It's alright, baby.
Who was he, Momma? He tried to kill us.
If he was trying to kill you, you'd be dead.
Who? Who is he? What is he?
You got his hands. Beautiful hands. I didn't even know. That night. When they - we - killed him, that you were already alive inside me. Life's like that. Grows right out of death.
But if it's him. If he's really come back, won't he know us? Love us?
Sure, if it was really him. But it isn't that simple. Jimmy's body died a long time ago. And his soul is long gone, and all that's left is that ravening, hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself, I suppose.
He'll kill them. He'll kill every last one of them.
Who?
Eddie Mack, that cop. And Jeremiah. And even when he's done, who knows. He won't be satisfied. Just like that demon dog. Feed it, and it just grows hungrier. Feed his hunger for revenge - he just wants more. Who knows where it'll stop. That kind of hunger ain't never satisfied.
Aren't you gonna do something about it?
Like what? I got a little power, sure. A touch of the shining, a little of the sight. But no more than you do. We're not witches. I can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. Besides, maybe they deserve it. Maybe we all do.
I don't. Patrick doesn't. And his brother and sister don't. And they're in the house with him.
We'll have to sneak in.
No we won't, Momma. I'll just have them call and tell Patrick it's us.
Told you so. Alright. We tried. Let's go home.
In his grave there was a cloth or a dress or something. Covered with blood.
no really, let us help. We're new in the neighborhood, gonna be neighbors.
Are they on the radio?
Naw. But they will be. They're the best.
How do you know?
Guess it's not Rossmore Park. Thanks for the help.
Careful. That's bad luck.
That place is already bad luck.
Why?
No. It goes way back. Or so my Momma says.
What else does she say?
Nothing. You'd think she was crazy. And she is a lot of things, not all of them nice, but crazy Momma's not.
Way I figure, everything our parents tell us is part true and part total B.S. And our whole job is figuring out for ourselves which is which.
My momma says every house is two houses. Every street, two streets. There's a whole city, a whole world, kinda beside, on top, just below this one. The city of the dead.
Like right now, there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us? Fingers rotting off?
Maybe. But there's an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.
Lucky thing.
Yeah. But when something bad happens, something really bad -- the wall breaks. The fabric tears.
The dead get out?
Or the living fall in. Who knows.
And you believe her?
Cinn?
She doesn't want me here. With you. In this house.
Believe me, my old man'd rupture his spleen if he knew we was down here. All he talks about is the medal he deserves for building us a life as far from this 'hood as possible.
He probably thinks he's saving you from something. I'm sure that's what my mother thinks.
I can't. Not yet.
It's alright. If you want to go home...
No, I want to stay with you guys. But I can't. I mean I'm not ready.
Why couldn't you just tell him to let us in?
I'm here.
Bill! Bill?!
Patrick, he's...
Here, find my hand. The stairs are right near here. I saw them. Let's just walk up there.
I can't find you.
We gotta jump!
We're here. Where the hell are you?
You got the cash?
You got the shit?
Let me see it.
Let me see it.
Where is it?
Don't worry. It's just round the corner. Halfway down that block, you can't miss it. Top step of the front stairs, there's a loose stone. Go on, I ain't shitting you.
But maybe we're the ones who should be down there. Doing something. Making it better.
Where are we going? You know I hate surprises.
What are we doing down here?
Listen to me, boy. I didn't work all my life to get out of this neighborhood for you to move right back in!
I thought you'd be psyched. Just trying to do what you did. Take nothing and make something out of it.
No one'll ever come here. Shut it down. Don't worry, the bank'll buy it back. I'll take care of it.
You'll take care of it? Not this time. No way. I bought it fair and square. And we open tonight.
Did you do it?
Sure, son. I went down there and torched the place myself.
You could have had it done. You didn't want us there.
I wouldn't have risked killing you to get you out. I was trying to protect you.
Why? Why did you give a shit about the building? Why did you care that we were there of all places?
It's...it's a bad neighborhood. As you can see now.
Bullshit, Dad. Don't front me. For once. Just tell me the truth. I came from there, too.
You were just a kid.
I saw your face. You knew that place. You knew those people.
That's the past. It's dead.
Please...help me...
Help me. I'm so sorry. But please, help me...
What the hell do you want?
Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird.
You certainly traded up. ...the trophy wife. Nice lookin'.
Keep your hands to yourself, willya?
I been watching you. You done good. Invested wisely. Respectable businessman now. Just like you always wanted.
And you? Still a pig. Just a much fatter one.
No reason to get nasty. Yeah, I've stayed in the organization. But then again I never got the percentage you did.
Or you didn't know what to do with it.
Maybe so. Maybe so. But that ain't why I came to see you. You sold the building.
What building?
Don't shit a shitter. Our building. What did you call it? His 'tomb'? We had an agreement. You were supposed to sit on it. Not sell it --
I didn't sell it.
You're right. One of my associates sold the building last month.
That's a Bozo no-no. Jay-bird.
Look, even if anyone found anything there, it's twenty years ago. They could never connect it to us.
Nice rack. How old is --
No way man...
Not your style. Is it Eddie? Killing off your customers?
I ain't killed nobody. Shall I rack 'em? Play a game, Lupe?
Fair enough for the shit. But I think a little bonus is due for knocking out the competition.
You was just doing your job.
What it is? What it will be, muthafucka.
I know it. The old slaughterhouse. Hey, Sal. That little weasel we popped today? He's got something for us. I knew he would once he thought about it.
Shit, that was fast.
12-year olds. They scare easy. Anyway, he's gonna tip their stash. Come with me.
I'm on my way home. Can you handle it yourself?
Oh, no. Please don't make me go by myself. I'm scaaaaaaaaaared.
Goddamnit! How many times I told you --
We got a gift for you, Eddie. Fresh new BMW.
That you stole off those white boys was down here last night? Are you crazy? Everybody from hell to breakfast heard that screamin' on Blackstone last night!
But --
We just thought...
We didn't do nothing, Eddie.
You gon tell me you didn't ginsu those punks and steal their ride?
That's all we did, steal their ride.
You boys been hitting the pipe?
No, Eddie. It's just that, I dunno. He was tall, and thin, and like a shadow, his face was just a blur. All I remember is the voice. It was smooth and low and it didn't seem to be comin' out of his mouth.
Then how'd you hear it, fool?
It was just like in my head.
I just accelerated my top secret long term plan for our world domination.
Sqweeep. We innerup this programme to bring you this special news bulletin -- "Aliens from Reticula 3 have hijacked Patrick Peet and injected moly headcheese into his skull filling his entire brain cavity with cosmic slop..."
And damp, too. Let's not forget damp.
Jimmy Bones?
Yeah, you heard of him?
You haven't?
Not that I remember.
He was a local legend back in the '70's. There was a song, Stagolee kinda deal: "This is the ballad of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stone..."
You gotta use your imagination.
"This is Patrick..." "...And this is Patrick on crack." Imagination, my butt. Even the space cowboy can't...
Why don't y'all check out the rest? I'm going downstairs and see if I can get the furnace fired up. Warm this place up, you'll see. It has serious potential.
Yeah right, and which ever of us is still alive at the end of the week inherits all Vincent Price's cash.
I thought you were bringing the Colonel?
The Gangster of Love don't eat no fried chicken.
Why not? He eats everything else.
Maurice, even if it was true, what are you worried about? Last time I checked, you weren't black. I'm not sure what the hell you are. But I know you aren't a black man.
I am the future. I am all colors. All races. All creeds. I am the melting pot. I am the tossed salad. I am post racial.
"Like a heartbeat/Like a love beat." Listen to the Di Franco twins there. Just the plumbing or something, fool.
And some people need their medication tweaked.
Need any help with those bags, Ma'am?
Not really to live, just to play.
That building?
Gonna be le hot shit. Pardon my Francais. Dance club. The Resurrection Brothers play there. Heard of them?
You look mighty familiar to me. You sure you're not from around here?
I was born near here. But after my mother died, my dad moved. I grew up out in Rossmore Park.
You sure we oughta save him? Why not just let see how safe his gates and walls keep him when his past comes calling?
... see there ain't just two parts to a person. There's three. Body-Soul and Spirit. The spirit lives in the blood. It's the wanting that holds body and soul together, and sometimes, the wanting lives on. Jimmy's blood must still be in the house.
But the place burned to the ground.
It's not safe down there. The fire started down there. The whole thing could collapse.
Well, the bad news is we only made 25 bucks each.
How could that be? The box was packed!
Illibent? Who's club is that?
There wasn't any draft. That window was closed.
Boy, put that thing down. You can't take that. Might be evidence.
Evidence of what?
Shit! Damn dog. We gonna have to do something about you.
Whoa, whoa. Come on, he's making too much noise.
You hear that, bitch? Be quiet!
You shouldn't have hit me.
You want to get into this now?
Glenlivet, right, Gino?
So Caesar, what did it total out at?
Come on, Pop, all I want to know is one thing. Just one thing after he made such a big deal out of it. I bet it wasn't a big deal. Was it, Caesar?
What's that, Johnnie?
Where is this going, Johnnie?
Just admit it, Caesar.
Admit what?
That's right, I know. I fucking know.
Know what?
Open the case!
All right! Where's the key?
How the fuck can I open it?
The same way you did before.
You don't think I'll do it, do you?
I think you're fucking crazy!
Where is it?
Where's what?
The money!
The next one blows off your dick.
You're a dead man! A fucking dead man!
We know how this was done, eh?
Caesar? What is this?
Caesar!
No, Gino!
Sit down, Gino!
No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
We're family, Caesar.
No!
Gimme the gun.
I can't. I can't.
We make our own choices, we pay our own prices.
All part of the business.
I didn't expect --
Oh, shit ...
Caesar, this is Corky. Corky, Caesar.
She's doing the work herself.
So, you just got out?
Jesus, Caesar!
Not bad. What for?
That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.
Caesar, I'm leaving.
Caesar, I'm serious. This is too much. I have to get out of here.
Caesar, what happened?
Just look at this mess I got to deal with.
What are you going to do with it?
Where the hell's the laundry detergent?
Fuck! Fuck! How did you ... Awwww goddammit!
Don't worry, I'll get some more.
There's no time.
They were early.
What are you talking about?
They just left, didn't they?
You mean they weren't up here?
No! They're still on their way.
That doesn't make any sense.
Why?
What?
I was getting out of the car when I saw him in the Mercedes.
It couldn't have been.
It was him. I'm positive.
It's impossible!
Why? Why would Johnnie do this?
I hate that little fuck! I hate him! I hate him! I should've done him!
But you know he did it.
So what?! So fucking what? Use your head, Violet. The money is gone. Gino is coming here to get it. You think he's going to believe me if I tell him his piss-hole son stole it! Is that what you think? I don't. You know what I think? I think I'm a dead man. I'm one in the brain. That's what I think!
Got to think this through ...
Caesar, maybe we should run --
Violet, please!
I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late --
Goddammit, Violet! Would you just leave me the fuck alone! Please! Leave! Now!
I got it! I know what I got to do! I got to get the money.
The money? The money's gone.
No. Johnnie's got it. All I got to do is get it back.
But it could be anywhere.
He didn't see you, did he?
No.
See, right now he doesn't know that I know, that's why he put the paper in the case. He wants me to hand the case to Gino. Then there is no doubt it was me. Gino will put a bullet in me himself. But it ain't going to happen. I won't let it! Johnnie ain't going to fuck me! Not like this! No way!
You can't leave.
The hell I can't!
I need you ...
Bullshit! You don't need me! You've never needed me! I can't help you! Understand?! I have to get out.
If you're not with me, Violet, then I have to assume you're against me.
Caesar, this is crazy.
It would have been so easy to let him in as you went out.
You don't, you can't believe that ...
All right, Johnnie, you want to play it this way, I can play it this way. You want to know who made a mistake, why don't you open the case.
Caesar ...
Tell them! Tell them!
... maybe three hours.
Caesar, what are you going to do?
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
What?
Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened.
Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
No I didn't. Not if his body disappears and not if the money is still here. Then they never showed up.
What happened to them?
Fuck.
Caesar, what are we going to do?
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
It's not here, Caesar.
Where, then?
What are you doing?
We're going to need some time.
I can use Johnnie's car, dump it in Lake Michigan ... I need plastic bags ... tape and rope ...
Where is the money?
Don't tell him --
Shut up, Violet!
Violet!
Stupid cunt!
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
Don't try to tell me what to do.
You need the money just like we do.
Shut up, Violet.
What did she do to you?
I saved you.
Saved me? You don't even know me. You used me, Caesar, just like I used you. All part of the business.
You betrayed me!
You murdered Gino!
I had to. You made me.
Bullshit, you killed him. Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you.
What?
Holy shit, I don't believe it! We've been going crazy over here, Gino!
We were in a car accident --
They were in a car accident.
But everybody is all right.
They're all fine. Just bruises and shit.
We make a deal or I come out and hand this phone to Mickey.
I want what's mine, half the money. We get rid of Mickey, no one else dies. No one. Say yes, I understand.
Yes, I understand.
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out.
Now that's teamwork.
I should have let him kill you.
You know he would have done you, too.
Caesar, don't.
What are you going to do, V? Shoot me? Kill me in cold blood? I don't think so. I'll tell you why. If you had it in you to pull that trigger, you would have done it a long time ago. If I was you, I would have killed me the minute I brought the money home. But you didn't and I know why,
How's it going tonight, fellas?
Fuck, this happened before. It's this shitty ear. Born with it. The batteries wore out in my aid. I'm sorry.
Not on duty, sorry.
I'm going to make myself a drink, if that's okay?
Try to keep the extra batteries for your aid around.
You planned this whole thing, didn't you?
You're helping Rajeev?
How many'd you do?
Good. I hate to worry. I got ulcers.
I should be going.
What? How about a drink?
My brushes, I have to clean my brushes. Thanks, though.
Another time.
Now, where the fuck is my money?
Lick me.
Where is it?
I'm going to ask you where the money is. Every time you don't give me an answer, I'm going to cut off one finger.
No.
You can't kill me yet.
Why?
Now why don't you go watch some TV or something?
Are you okay, Violet?
Caesar, didn't I tell you to get something?
Yeah?
Mick, I know it's late, but there is a problem. They haven't shown up yet.
What? They ain't there?
No. I don't know where they are. I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
Okay. Let me call around. I'll see what I can do. Don't go anywhere, okay?
Okay, sure, Mick.
Yeah, Mick. I've got the money. I'm staring right at it.
No, Cease. There was no answer.
I thought I heard someone knocking.
I was buzzing, I was knocking, but I guess you couldn't hear me on account of being in the shower.
Yeah, it was Violet's idea. I was so wound up about Gino, she was trying to help me relax.
That Violet is one nice lady. Wish someone would help me relax.
We was worried about you, Cease.
Me? Why?
I started thinking maybe it's about the money so I call you, but all I get is the busy signal. I figure the phone is off the hook, that's why I come rushing over here.
Oh Christ, the phone ... That was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't it?
Cease, can I ask you something?
Yeah.
Actually, yeah, she was nervous about Gino coming, wanted everything to look right. You know women, Mick.
Is that the money?
Hey, Caesar, where's the key?
The key, yeah, the key's in my pants in the bathroom.
It's Gino! It's Gino!
Un-fucking-believable. I called those highway patrol dumb fucks.
You got the key?
Call me as soon as you get him.
Hello?
We had a report of gunfire, so if you could --
No joke, ma'am. Please open the door.
Ma'am, you have to open the door.
See? We're for real.
I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.
This is a beautiful place.
Hi. My name is Violet. We sort of met in the elevator --
Yeah, sure. I'm Corky.
Who?
Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.
So this is temporary for you?
I guessed you were straight black.
Mmmm ... thanks, I needed this.
My pleasure ... but to be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive here. I was wondering if I could ask a small favor?
A favor?
Yeah, see, I'm kind of a night person, so I was wondering if it wasn't a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools.
Oh, I'm sorry --
No, it isn't your fault. The walls here are just so thin.
Are they really?
Yes, it really causes problems. Sometimes it's like you're in the same room. But if it's too much trouble, I understand ...
No, no trouble. There's other work to do.
You're doing everything yourself?
Yeah.
Truck.
Truck. Of course.
'63 Chevy.
I knew it.
So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?
I don't, really. I was referred to him.
Do you know him?
No, but Caesar does. He likes him. Says he's a good Italian.
Caesar is your husband?
I should be going. You can drop the cup off anytime.
Thanks.
Oh no. Shit. I didn't know he would call you. God, you must think |I'm a total nuisance.
Not exactly.
I'm sorry, I usually would call Rajeev, but I didn't know what to do so I called Mr. Bianchinni.
He said you lost something.
I'm sorry, look, forget it. I shouldn't have called...
Do you have a pot or a bucket?
Thank you so much. You have to let me pay you something --
Okay, one drink.
What do you want?
A beer?
You seem uncomfortable. Do I make you nervous, Corky?
Curious, maybe.
Are you surprised that I know what it is?
Maybe.
Isn't it obvious? I'm trying to seduce you.
Why?
You dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you?
If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
No.
I had to see you.
Look, I don't think this is a good idea.
I wanted to apologize.
... I needed that.
Caesar's Mafia, isn't he?
You have to ask?
No.
Funny, nobody calls it that anymore. Caesar calls it "The |Business."
How did you meet him?
They took over a club I was working at. Caesar started managing it.
He's a launderer?
Basically.
How long have you been with him?
Almost five years.
Five years is a long time.
The redistribution of wealth.
What?
Isn't that what you wanted to know? What I did time for?
The redistribution of wealth?
That's what I tell someone when I'm trying to get them in my bed.
I'm already in your bed.
You didn't have to tell me if you didn't want to.
I guess I wanted to.
I'm glad you did.
What's wrong?
Yes there is. I felt it this morning when I brought you the coffee.
Shit, here we go.
You didn't want to see me, did you?
If there is one thing I can't stand about sleeping with women, it's all the fucking mind reading.
What are you afraid of?
I'm not afraid of anything.
I don't understand - ?
I know! You can't understand, because we're different, Violet. We're different.
We're not that different, Corky.
How can you sit in that bed and say that?
Because it's the truth.
Let me guess. This is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside. That inside you, there is a little dyke just like me?
Oh no, she's nothing like you. She's a lot smarter than you.
Is that what her daddy tells her?
I know what I am. I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.
What are you saying? That you don't have sex with men?
I don't.
For Christ's sake, Violet! I heard you! Thin walls, remember?
What you heard wasn't sex.
What the fuck was it?
All my life, everyone has been telling me that when I have sex, I'm not really having sex. Not real sex. But they're wrong. I know what is and isn't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex.
What was it then?
We make our own choices and we pay our own prices. I think we're more alike than you want to admit.
What about that guy this morning?
You mean Shelly?
Don't tell me, you're a workaholic.
No. Shelly knows what I am. He saw me in a bar with another woman.
Fuck it! I think you better leave.
Shelly was skimming from the business. He came to see me yesterday because he was afraid Caesar figured it out. He wanted to run but he wanted me to come with him.
Even though he knew about you?
Yes.
He was in love with you, right?
For Shelly, taking the money was a way to take from Caesar. He could have run at any time, but he didn't because he didn't want out.
Sounds like he wanted to get caught.
Caesar lives for these moments. He tells me it's just the business, but I know it's more than that. He likes it. The violence. I'll catch him in the bathroom mirror touching his scars. He says they remind him who he his. They're all like that. Except maybe Mickey.
Mickey?
I want out. I want a new life. I see what I've been waiting for, but I need you, Corky.
For what?
You made a choice once. Do you think you would make that same choice again?
What choice?
Caesar is going to get the money and bring --
How much money?
Caesar will bring it to the apartment to count and go through |Shelly's books to figure out how he did it.
These people are serious, Violet. If you want to know how serious, ask Shelly. They're worse than any cop because they have lots of money and no rules. You fuck them, you've got to do it right.
That's why I need your help. You said you were good.
All right, let's say for the moment that I believe everything you are saying.
You think I'm lying?
All you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected, someone like me.
Is that what you think?
The difference is, I can have sex with someone I just met, someone I hardly know, but to steal I need to know someone like I know myself.
Do you think you know me like that?
You said he washed the money?
Yeah.
Then what? Exactly.
He hung it up.
What?
And where is it now?
It's in a case, on his desk.
Yes.
All right, now, tell me about Johnnie.
Johnnie?
It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other.
Like each other? They hate each other.
Why?
It started way before I was around. I think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father.
Gino Marzzone.
Marzzone? As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family?
That's his brother.
Gino Marzzone is coming tonight to pick up the money?
Yeah.
And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone?
Yeah.
Gino Marzzone is coming to your apartment. It's a big deal, isn't it? That means Caesar will be ready. He doesn't want to look like an idiot. Gino has been there before?
Yeah, twice.
What happened?
Does Johnnie hit on you?
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
Has Caesar ever seen him?
He does it right in front of him.
It's getting better and better. Keep going.
Gino doesn't know English, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much. He gets right to the point. Both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left.
What did Gino drink?
What time did you say they would be there?
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
Any bodyguards?
Gino travels with a big man named Roy. Caesar calls him the driver.
We want him to come down, to relax, feel in control again.
Where will you be?
And as you do, the bottle will slip from your hands. -- and shatter against the hardwood floor.
An accident.
What if he sees you?
You can't know for certain that he won't see you.
I'm just asking, what if?
There is no going back.
When I get the Scotch, how do I know you won't take off?
I still don't see how I'm going to get clean with the money in the apartment. Everyone will think I did it.
Not Caesar.
Why?
If it's real enough, he'll believe it, because deep down he'll want to.
He'll have to run.
If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
Jesus, that's beautiful.
Thank you.
If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
I had a partner and she fucked me.
I won't.
It's me.
He totally freaked. I've never seen him like this. He's out of his fucking mind.
That's okay, as long as he believes it was Johnnie.
Believes it! Jesus, it's driving him crazy. He wants to kill him. I don't know, Corky, I don't know what he is going to do. I'm getting nervous, really nervous.
It's all right, Violet. It's working. All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does.
What if he doesn't run?
That means he probably will kill Johnnie.
Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here!
Listen, if he doesn't run, all you have to do is break down, go to your bedroom and pack some things, start crying, saying you love him but you can't do it. You're sorry but you have to leave and just walk out.
okay, all right.
Oh, thank God.
I'm still here.
I was so afraid you ...
I'm sorry, Corky ...
Hey.
Hey.
How'd it go?
You know what the difference is between us, Violet?
No.
Hey, Caesar! You take care of this girl, or I find out!
No, Johnnie. No goddamned phones. Not now.
Pop?
Done. We go now.
Unbelievable. Can you believe that, Violet?
Johnnie, what did I say?
You shouldn't have to see this. Why don't you get out of here? Go for a walk.
Caesar wants me to stay.
Oh, God.
Mickey? What are you doing here?
Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie. They were in a car accident.
Oh my God. Was anyone hurt?
Mickey! Oh God, Mickey!
I will never understand it, Mickey. You didn't even call the police.
I told you, the family doesn't want the police around. We want to take care of it ourselves and we will. I'll find him. I swear I will.
I know you will.
Sure you're going to be okay? I mean, if you're having second thoughts, my offer still stands.
Storm clouds are gathering, Ted. It looks like rain and I don't have a thing to wear.
I don't know what we're talking about.
We're talking about Marseille. We're talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And I'm asking you if this abortion in Marseille has anything to do with Treadstone. Was this Treadstone?
You're asking me a direct question?
Yes.
They're putting together an agency oversight committee. They're going to look through everyone's budgets. Treadstone is a rather sizable line item in my ledger. What am I going to do about that?
You'd want to make that go away. You'd want to remind them that Treadstone is a training organization. That it's all theoretical. You'd want to sign off on that.
And what if I couldn't do that?
She's a gypsy. If it's a cover, it's a great one.
I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility.
We're exploring <u>every</u> possibility. We are in pursuit. How much more do you want me to tell you?
Pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is.
No. Pursuit <u>ends</u> when we know exactly where he is.
We've been down here for two weeks banging our heads against the wall. We've been <u>sleeping</u> down here. We just got our first lead fourteen hours ago, and now? -- now that we <u>finally</u> have something to work with -- you want to bring planning personnel down here? I'd rethink that.
I want a second opinion.
<u>This is an operations desk</u>.
That was two hours -- two hours to get a second opinion -- and nothing changes. He's loose. He's out of control. It's very clear what needs to happen. I have work to do.
What if he <u>is</u> working for someone else? What if he turned?
No. We can't risk it.
Our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago. Even if they stayed in the car, the grid is huge. This is it. He's trained -- conditioned -- they're built to disappear. You give him another day to run and we may never find him.
-- he went inside! --
-- if we can get a clean shot --
-- <u>inside</u> the house? --
-- that's what they're trained for -- just a surgical strike.
Forget it.
What do you want to do?
We don't know what we're into!
I'm going to Paris.
<u>No you're not</u>. You're not going anywhere. I'm shutting this down.
You're not doing shit. You're so scared you can't even think.
You just blew up a house in Paris! This program is over. Call it off.
I won't ask again.
I work alone. Like you... ...we always work alone.
What do you mean?
Who are you? Rome? Paris? Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
Treadstone?
Paris. I live in Paris...
...headaches...you have that...I get such bad headaches...
Yes.
Treadstone.
...or in a car...when it's dark...something with the headlights... ...pills, right? Treadstone had those pills...
What is Treadstone?
...what did you do?...you must've really fucked up...
I think so.
...someone said caffeine -- for a headache...doesn't seem...
What do they want me to do?
...they won't let you go...
Are you Treadstone?
<u>What did you do to me</u>?
What did I do? I spent thirty million dollars on you. I spent three years finding you -- four years training you -- What did I do? What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason?
I don't know.
They're right about you, aren't they? You're fried. You really don't know what's going on, do you?
I know you've been trying to kill me.
Of course. We had to try. We didn't know what was wrong. We didn't know you were in trouble.
So now you know.
So it's time to go home.
That's all I get?
We'll make you better. We can put the pieces back. We can do that.
I don't think so.
We have to go home, Jason.
Jason Bourne is dead.
<u>There never was a Jason Bourne</u>. You have to come with me. It's the only way. We can give it back to you...
Keep it.
Jason... They can't let you go...
Did you bring investment advice for me tonight? It was tax shelters, wasn't it? Swiss debenture-swaps.
MPG Capital.
I think investment advice from a dead man, it's a bad idea. How does it feel to be dead?
Who do you think sent me?
<u>Was this a game or a fuck up</u>?
I don't know.
You're a U.S. Citizen?
Yes. I mean, I think so. Yes. Yes...
Well, either you are, or you aren't.
Right.
You have your passport?
I have a passport. I've got... Actually, it's a little complicated.
<u>Do you have your passport, sir</u>?
Look, maybe I should just...
Sir, you waited on line.
...yes -- oui -- uh...

Paris?
Yes, sir... How can I help you?
Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
One moment, please... I'm afraid, I have no one by that name registered, sir.
D'accord... Merci. Un moment -- un moment --
-- sir? --
Kane. Do you have Mr. John Michael Kane?
Bonjour? Monsieur? Allo...
Yes, I'm here...
You call about Monsieur Kane? John Michael Kane?
Yes. Is he there?
You are a friend of his?
Yes.
There was an accident. On the motorway. Apparently, he was killed instantly. Really, I'm terrible sorry to be the one to tell you this...
...I understand...
...we actually, we were unaware for several days that this had happened. When they came for his things, it was made known for us, you see?
Who? Who came?
His brother. You know his brother?
Right. Yes. Of course.
It's very bad this. Terrible sad. Such a young man.
Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number?
Mr. Kane... Come right in...please...have a seat.
Well... I must admit, when my assistant told me you were here I was, really -- I was quite -- I was surprised.
Really.
We thought you were gone for good.
Did you?
Look, our bid -- it was competitive -- but definitely at the high end of competitive -- when we didn't hear back from you, we did some re-analysis of the numbers, and honestly, we'd really like a chance to do a bit better. I'm assuming you're still in the market. It's the same vessel?
Yes.
We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser. I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive.
Was it the break-in?
Excuse me?
We also thought we hadn't heard from you -- we've had a bit of a publicity nightmare, people have been talking. Our offices were broken into -- vandalism mostly -- shortly after we last spoke.
Let me get you a new copy of the proposal.
I need a ride.

I need a ride out of here.
Oh, Jesus...
Please. I don't want to scare you.
It's a little late for that.
I've got a situation here and --
Get the fuck away from my car.
I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris.
Great. You know what? I'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before I start screaming my head off.
Jesus...
So what's in Paris?
I want to go home.
I said ten thousand.
You have blood on your pants.
Okay. Twenty thousand. Ten now. Ten there.
<u>No</u>. No, that was too easy --
Wait up -- -- just wait up --
Look, I want a ride to Paris. That's all I want. I swear.
You swear? That's great. I feel so much better now.
You could buy a car for twenty grand. You could buy this car.
I don't want to go alone. I want you to drive me to Paris. Like we're a couple. Like we're a couple and we're travelling together. That's all we're doing.
And I don't get hurt. I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt.
I won't hurt you.
What if I say no?
Just so you know, if you're gonna burn me on the money, you might as well kill me. I was supposed to have this car back three days ago. It's not my car.
Shit -- Can I tell you how much you're freaking me out? Okay? Because you are -- you're completely freaking me out.
I'm sorry. Really. What do you want me to do?
I don't know. Smile. Sneeze. Something. You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris. Fuck it, I don't know... What kind of music do you like?
I don't know.
What does that mean?
Listen to what you want.
I don't know. I don't know who I am.
Yeah, well, welcome to the club.
No. No, I mean, I really don't know who I am. I can't remember anything earlier than two weeks ago. I'm serious.
What? Like amnesia?
Look, go ahead...put the radio on...
Amnesia? You're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago?
That's what I'm saying.
And you have no idea -- not a clue -- what came before that?
No.
When you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see?
Nothing. It's just not there.
Well, this is great. I'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are.
I kept trying things, I thought if I could find all the things I could do, I could --
-- you could put it together --
-- which was okay for a while, I was okay with it... But then -- there's all these other things -- all these other things I know how to do -- and this -- this stuff from the bank and... I think something bad happened.
What are you talking about?
I don't know.
Sounds like you were in an accident or something.
I was shot twice in the back.
Okay, so you're a victim.
There was a gun. Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
Lots of people have guns. You're American. Americans love guns.
I fought my way out of an embassy. I climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- I went out the window and I was doing it -- I just did it. I knew how to do it.
People do amazing things when they're scared.
Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door --
I needed a break.
Where are we?
We're about an hour away.
I can't believe I slept.
You were tired. Here... For twenty-thousand I like to throw in breakfast. So what do you dream about?
You ever think maybe you have a family?
Slow down. No, don't stop. Just...
Four-fifty. That's the address...
Looks familiar?
Where?
So this is it, right?
I should go.
I don't remember any of this.
Okay, so...
Thanks for the ride.
Look, I don't know what's up there.
You got me pretty fucking curious.
Look, you could come up. Or you could wait if you want. I could go check it out. You could wait.
Nah... With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
This is like a real apartment. This is really yours?
This is your office? God, you live like a monk...
All this stuff -- it's all about boats. I think I'm in the shipping business.
See. It's starting to come back, yeah? You mind if I take a bath?
-- no -- Marie -- <u>no</u>! -- it's not like that --
-- please -- Jason -- omigod --
-- what're you doing? -- Jason, please, tell me what's happening!
WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?
What? -- what? -- -- what is it?
...this is my picture... he's got my picture -- -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --
-- just --
-- where does this come from? -- How do you have my picture?
Marie, just -- -- just stay there! -- just --
-- he's got my picture! -- this is yesterday! -- this is me! -- -- where did you get my picture? --
-- let me do this, okay? --
He's dead isn't he?
Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this --
He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
-- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here --
He came to kill us.
-- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --
You knew he was coming.
No.
I trusted you.
You're wrong. I didn't know.
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
I didn't know this would happen.
He had my picture! He knew I was here! He came here to kill us!
And where is he now? You believe what you want, but I'm telling you the truth -- I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous.
Oh, Jesus...
You stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know -- But I can't stay here. <u>I can't</u>.
But the police --
-- there's no time --
-- we'll explain it --
-- how? --
-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
-- forget it --
-- we'll tell them what happened --
You stayed there five times in the past six months. But I didn't have time -- I could only get the bill from the last stay -- you were there for two days. Some room service -- there's half a dozen phone calls here so that's someth--
Who paid the bill?
I found it. It took six calls. I found Kane. I found the body.
-- I don't know what you're doing and you're scaring me -- what are you looking for? -- what just happened in there? --
Nykwana Wombosi.
What is that?
It's a name. Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht. He's the proud owner of an Alliance Security package. He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane.
What does that mean? Jason, what does that mean? Jason, please...who is he?
I don't know.
<u>So what are we doing</u>?
It doesn't matter who you were before. It's who you want to be. That's all that matters. We have this money. We have what we have. I had nothing before and now, I don't know, maybe I have more, maybe it's nothing, but... I say we leave here. We leave this place. We go until we can't go anymore.
You could do that?
xxxxxx.
Stop where you are.

xxxxxx
Who is it?
xxxxxx

And that's it?
What was I thinking, right?
I can't protect you anymore.
What about you?
Can I help you?
This your store?
Yes.
Think I could rent a scooter?
You have ID?
Where did this body go?
I said, someone came last night -- Look, this isn't a carnival -- people call and they make an appointment and they follow the rules -- everyone signs in and out -- this is a serious place -- serious work -- it's not just to come in whenever you like --
Shit, we didn't sign in.
So get the hell out of here.
Is this it? -- -- this is it, right? --
-- slow down -- you can't just take the book like that --
-- we have rules here, this is a very serious place -- I'm the one who decides who gets in here, okay? --
-- what do I? -- I put the name of the person I came to see? --
-- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going --
Where's the dog?
My husband's out looking for him.
He run away often?
Get in the basement.
What?
What the hell're you talking about?
You're in danger. All of you. I have no time to explain.
Wait a minute --
Miss Kreutz, please... I'm gonna have to ask you to keep your voice down.
All the papers -- all the papers they asked for -- I brought all the papers --
<u>Miss Kreutz</u>, excuse me, but you entered into a fraudulent marriage in an effort to circumvent the immigration laws of the United States --
You only know that because I told you! Ask the case officer -- find his name -- it's on the papers -- I told him all this myself! --
-- it's not the source of the information that's important here --
-- I paid this fucking guy -- I paid him four thousand dollars -- my last four thousand dollars to marry me, okay? -- I told this to the case officer last week... ...<u>here</u> -- Mr. Thomas. I told Mr. Thomas I didn't know this guy was already married -- I admitted this!
-- Miss Kreutz, please --
-- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off!
xxxxxx...
And that's the best angle of the courtyard?
That's the only angle.
What do they have on the streets? The area. They must have something.
Sir...
What's that?
It's an angle of the street -- some sort of alleyway -- you can just...
-- let's check that Interpol window again --
-- I'm on it --
What?
Abbott wants to talk.
Tell him we're busy.
-- and they're sure it's him? --
-- he accessed the account --
-- but it was <u>him</u> --
What?
What the fuck is he doing?
Maybe it's a game. Maybe he's trying to send us a message.
It doesn't matter now. We've just got to be the first ones there. Get everybody up. I want them all activated.
What?
Abbott. He knows about the embassy. He's coming down for a show and tell.
-- what're you talking about? --
-- we're evacuating the building --
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
-- you gotta give me more to go on --
You're awake. Can you hear me? You've been shot. I'm trying to help you. You were in the water. You've been shot. It's okay now.
Where am I?
You're American. I thought so. From your teeth -- the dental work --
<u>Where am I</u>?
You're on a boat. A fishing boat. Italian flag. We're out of Vietri. It's the cold that saved you. The water. The wounds are clean. I'm not a doctor, but the wounds, it looks okay. It's clean.
How did I get here?
What if it doesn't come back?
It came from your hip. Under the skin. You have a bank in Zurich. You remember Zurich?
Look, I'm just on this boat, okay? I'm an engineer. Whatever this is, it's not for me to be involved, okay?
You drink rum?
It's not much, but it should get you to Switzerland.

He's tampered with it, Dowser.
I think we'd better have a look.
What have you got there?
Mumble ... mumble ... mumble ... Tuttle
Mumble ... Tuttle ...
Tuttle! ... mumble! You've had that scab Tuttle here, haven't you?
Oh yeh? Where'd you get this from eh out yer nostril?
...Yer nostril?
Central Services don't take kindly to sabotage!
...ven't you?
You're putting your talents to very odd use Mr Lowry - yes, odd use - to pit wits against Central Services -
Sign here, please.
This is what you get when you have cowboys round yer ducts.
... yer ducts.
I think you've got your T41 crystal inductor wired up to a reverse bobbin- threaded-solenoid-control. It's either that or a new washer.
... new washer.
Sign the form so we can get to it.
Ah ha ... there you are, Sam.
What? How do you know my name?
We know everything here. This is the Storeroom of Knowledge.
Then perhaps you can help me. I've lost someone who ...
Oh, yes. We've got everything here. Every bit of knowledge, wisdom, learning ... every experience, every thought neatly filed away.
What? You mean you've got ...
Well not exactly. But, if you help us we'll help you. The Forces Of Darkness have won the day ... but, tomorrow is another one
What do I have to do.
Er ... Thanks ...
It's reply paid.
Oh ... Thank you very much, mother, but actually -
You don't have to sing it.
Aren't you a bit late? - the party started half an hour ago.
Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise?
Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.
Go away.
Her name is Jill.
What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who?
Layton.
Jill Layton ... You're a very good little girl. What are you doing here?
I'm waiting for my daddy.
Deputy minister, what do you believe is behind this recent increase in terrorist bombings?
Bad sportsmanship. A ruthless minority of people seems to have forgotten certain good old fashioned virtues. They just can't stand seeing the other fellow win. If these people would just play the game, instead of standing on the touch line heckling -
In fact, killing people -
Mr. HELPMANN, what would you say to those critics who maintain that the Ministry Of Information has become too large and unwieldy ...?
And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister? Seven percent of the gross national produce ...
Do you think that the government is winning the battle against terrorists?
But the bombing campaign is now in its thirteenth year ...
Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.
Thanks very much Sam.
If I can help you ...
Sorry ...
I know he would have wanted me to help you ... And I promised your mother I'd take you onto the team at information Retrieval. But I gather that ...
Mr Helpmann. I've changed my mind. I'd like to accept the transfer - am I too late?
Too late? That's for me to say.
Sam, what are we going to do with you? Can you hear me, Sam?
Where's Jill? What have you done to her? Where is she?!
Gillian Layton?
Yes, you've got to get me out of here. I've got to find her.
Help me!
I assure you, Sam, I'm doing everything within my power. But the rules of the game are laid down, and we all have to play by them - even me.
This is all a mistake! Don't you understand?!
Yes, well, from the Department's point of view you're certainly a bit of an own goal, but ...
I'm not a terrorist! You must know that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of here!
Sam, if you've been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you've got absolutely nothing to worry about.
Please, I've got to find Jill.
Yes, it's all a bit confusing but, it seems she was killed resisting arrest.
Sam!
Jack!
Long time no see!
Well, since you disappeared up the ladder of Information Retrieval ... I don't expect to see you slumming in Records - what's the problem?
Problem? - No problem - yes, everything's going fantastically well, wonderful, marvelous, great career prospects, Alison in great shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I'm on Security Level Five now, and Mr Helpmann relies on me more and more, yes, couldn't be better, I feel terrifically motivated and job- rewarded -
You sound worried.
What's the matter?
Sorry. Nothing. See you - I'm going to be late.
You are late.
Even later.
Sam, your life is going wrong - let your friends tell you - Records is a dead end department, no Security Level worth a damn, it's impossible to get noticed -
Yes, I know, fantastic, marvellous, wonderful - remember me to Alison - and the - er - twins.
Triplets.
Hello, Jack!
{winking at Sam) She doesn't like me telling anyone but she's pleased as anything really.
Er, I knew you looked different.
Remember how they used to stick out?
Dr. Jaffe has pinned her ears back.
Quite, absolutely - I always thought they were false.
Jack!!
SAM! What a surprise!
Sorry about that ... Mr Helpmann told me you were coming aboard - congratulations!
Thanks. Are you officer 412/L?
For my sins. Are you settling in alright?
Yes, thanks.
Terrific. I'm really glad you dropped by. Unfortunately, I don't have any time right now I've got a queue of customers to deal with - er, why don't we have a drink tonight?
Ah ...
What?
I don't want to take up your time now, but I was hoping you could give me some information on somebody. It's a security level three matter and Information Retrieval records says to refer to you.
OK. Come back this afternoon, about four o'clock. If you give me the number of the case, I'll have the dossier here waiting. My tailor,... well worth the investment.
I've got numbers all over these - I'm not sure which is the one you want.
Layton! Oh shit!
What is it?
You clever bastard! I might have guessed. You only moved in today and you're already hot on the bloody trail.
Am I?
Please, Sam, we're going to have to be open to each other on this one. If you make a reputation with this case, it'll be at my expense.
How do you mean?
How much do you know?
Not much.
Enough though, eh?
OK. OK. Let's not fence around ... This is the situation. Some idiot somewhere in the building, some insect, confused two of our clients, B58/732 and T47/215.
B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?
Christ! You do know it all!
No, no, I don't. I'm just beginning Honestly. Sorry, carry on.
Well, your A. Buttle has been confused with T47/215, an A. Tuttle. I mean, it's a joke! Somebody should be shot for that. So B58/732 was pulled in by mistake.
You got the wrong man.
I did not get the wrong man. I got the right man. The wrong man was delivered to me as the right man! I accepted him, on trust, as the right man. Was I wrong? Anyway, to add to the confusion, he died on us. Which, had he been the right man, he wouldn't have done.
You killed him?
Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but Buttle's heart condition did not appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think I'm dismissing this business, Sam. I've lost a week's sleep over it already.
I'm sure you have
There are some real bastards in this department who don't mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but thank God there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication. We've got the upper hand for the moment, but they're waiting for us to slip up, and a little slip- up like this is just
So how ...?
What I've got to do now is pick up Tuttle, interrogate him at the same voltage as Buttle, to the same meter reading to the last penny, and juggle the books in electrical banking.
What has Tuttle done?
We suspect him of freelance subversion.
He's a freelance subversive?
What's she done?
You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?
Er ... no.
Very smart.
Er ... but I would've found out anyway.
Yes. I'm impressed.
Tell me about Layton.
She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the Buttle arrest - and since then she's been making wild allegations, obviously trying to exploit the situation - she's working for somebody, and she's not working for us.
But surely, I mean, perhaps she just happened to live above the Buttles, and ...
Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
Right. Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you?
Barbara's a perfectly good name, isn't it?
Look, about the Layton woman - maybe she's just trying to help the Buttle family.
Why?
Why? Hell, not for any reason ...
{baffled) I don't follow you.
Out of kindness.
Kindness? What's the purpose behind this line of enquiry?
So what are you going to do about her?
Get her out of circulation - I've put her on the detention list.
You mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?
Well, I ... Good point. What do you suggest?
Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her.
What does that mean? I don't want to be involved in anything unsavoury.
Trust me. You do trust me, don't you?
Of course. We went to school together. You're my oldest friend.
And you're mine.
You're the only person I can trust.
Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.
Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
They weren't at school with us.
But, I've already put her on the search and detain list.
Take her off the list.
There's no procedure for that until she's been arrested.
Say it was a mistake.
We don't make mistakes.
Well, I'd better get out there and try to get to her before security does. Let me borrow her dossier for a while.
Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch.
Do you know what you're doing.
Trust me.
Come off it, Jack! Of course you can check to see if she's been arrested.
I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.
She's innocent, Jack --- she's done nothing wrong.
Tell that to the wives of the Security men she blew up this afternoon. Listen, we've also had a report just in from Central Services that Tuttle has wrecked an entire flat and sabotaged adjacent Central Services systems - as a matter of fact, in your block. I'd keep my eyes open if I were you, Sam. Bye.
You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league?
It could all be coincidental.
Jack, she's innocent!
Sam - we've always been close, haven't we?
Yes we have, Jack!
Jack?... Jack?
Shut up!
Jack, I'm innocent! Help me.
Bastard!!!
You stupid bastard!
What?
How could you do this to me?
Help me, Jack! I'm frightened!
How do you think I feel? You shit!
Jack ...
I want to report a wrongful arrest.
You want Information Adjustments. Different department.
I've been to Information Adjustments. They sent me here. They told me you had a form I had to fill in.
Have you got an Arrest Receipt?
Yes.
Is it stamped?
Stamped?
No, there's no stamp on it. You see! I can't give you the form until it's stamped.
Where do I get it stamped?
But you've stamped this form before! Why won't you stamp it now?
You're a stupid, fat arsed, obstructive, fascist moron aren't you?
If you say so.
You think these are tits don't you?
Ah.
I bet you'd like to touch them?
Oh.
Are you alright?
It's you ... it's you ...
Who are you? Let go!
Don't look back! Act naturally!
Ow! That hurt!
What are you doing? For Christ's sake! Get moving!
Bloody hell! Do as I say!
No.
Alright! Alright! Alright! I'm Information Retrieval Officer - DZ/015, and I'm arresting you for - your own good! Now start up and get moving before I hand you back to them!
Them?
Don't litter my cab!
... This is amazing ... for me ... being here with you. I mean, in my dreams you ...
I don't want to hear about your fucking dreams!
Oh. But ... Look, I'm sorry I shouted at you.
Why are they all pigs at Information Retrieval?
You know, smoking's bad for you.
It's my fucking life.
Yes, of course. Sorry.
I know you. I saw you through the floor, didn't I?
Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away?
I didn't run away. I left the flat.
Why?
I didn't like it.
Why not?
It had a hole in the floor. Where are we going?
Where are you taking me?
What?
Where are you taking me?
Ah ... Er ... It looks as if you're taking me.
It does doesn't it?
What's going on here?
OK. What's in the parcel?
It's heavy.
What are you doing in Information Retrieval?
Looking for you.
No, really.
Really.
I mean, it doesn't suit you.
Suit me?
Don't you know the sort of thing that Information Retrieval does?
What do you mean? Would you rather have terrorists?
We've got both.
Things would be worse without Information Retrieval.
Why don't you say, no system is perfect.
Well, no system is.
Say, all wars have innocent victims.
Well, all wars do -
Who is this war against, Sam?
Well, terrorists of course.
How many terrorists have you met? Actual terrorists?
Look at that - right on time.
What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
Every day?
Turn around!
What?
They'll be there waiting.
Who will?
Security.
You're joking.
No. Please. They're going to arrest you.
I thought you arrested me.
Yes ... but, this is real. Now, stop!
Cut it out, Sam.
Will you please turn back.
Get away!
Turn!
I was right! Step on it!
Let go! We've got to stop!
Now you're the one that's out of your mind.
Come on, let's go! Let's get out of here!
Oh God! What have we done?
We? Don't blame me!
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.
Shit! The house is on fire!
"And your children all gone."
What?
"Lady bird, lady bird, fly away home, your house is on fire and your children all gone" ... Do you think anyone's hurt?
This is a hell of a time to buy a nightie.
Are you still following me?
Please, Jill ... I love you.
Go away.
There are plenty of other safe places. Why don't we go back to my flat?
Leave me alone!
You've got to trust me. It sounds silly but I know we were meant to meet.
You mean you were meant to hijack my truck, make me crash it, and have every security man in town looking for me?
I vas just trying to help. I decided to trust you. Maybe I was wrong. Whose side are you on really? Who are your friends? Who was the man who gave you the parcel? What's in it? It's the only thing you saved from the lorry .... It must he something very special.
I saved you from the lorry and you're not very special.
........... It's a bomb isn't it?
I'm going to open it!
Jill! What are you do ... I mean ... how did you ... Are you alright?
Yes.
What happened to you after ...
Your face ... are you hurt?
They're gone.
Are you sure?
Don't you like parties?
Make yourself at home. Don't answer the phone or open he door to anyone. I won't be long.
Where are you going?
I'm going to pull some strings. It's our only hope.
Don't do anything silly.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
What do you think? ... is it me?
Perhaps the machine's on the blink! It keeps picking up old films. That can't he right, can it?
It's not the machine. There's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers... Ah there we go! That's a B58/732 when it should be a T47/215 ... Tuttle ... he should have £31.06, debited against his account for electrical procedures, not Buttle.
Oh my God, a mistake!
It's not our mistake!
Isn't it? Whose is it?
Information Retrieval.
Oh, good!
What a relief! I don't know what I'd do if you ever got promoted.
Don't worry.
But if they did promote you
I've told you before. I'd turn it down.
Would you really, Sam?
Really.
It's your mother isn't it? Pulling strings again.
A cheque.
The refund for Tuttle!
Tuttle?
I mean, Buttle! It's been confusion from the word go! He's been wrongly charged for Electromemorytherapy and someone somewhere is trying to make us carry the can!
I've never seen a Ministry cheque before.
We've got to get rid of it! There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!
Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
I've tried that! Population Census have got him down as dormanted, the Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the Information Retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... Security has him down as excised., Admin have him down as completed
He is dead.
Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll never get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do?
Try next of kin.
There we go. Mrs. Veronica Buttle. What's the number on the cheque?
Problem. She doesn't have a bank account.
You'd never get away with it. Besides, you can't do that to somebody's refund. It's Christmas. There is one more option.
What?
Here. What do I do next?
Call the motor pool and authorise personal transport.
Of course, of course. Leave it to me. How do I authorize a cheque?
Oh God! I think I've broken a bone. What a pathetic thing I am.
That's it.
You are good to me Sam.
Is it all right about Mrs Buttle's cheque?
I delivered it.
Can I forget it?
Damn! Blast!
What's the matter?
You don't happen to know how I can get around an IRQ/3 do you?
All information on 3rd Level Suspects is classified.
I know that.
I've go to accept that promotion to get behind this, haven't I?
Yes. NO! You can't! You've only just turned it down!
I never signed the form.
I did it for you.
What! Shit!
It's what you wanted isn't it?
No, you can't have any more chairs! There's only one left in here now, and I need that to sit on! Oh ... er, sorry. Who are you?
Sam Lowry.
Ah, yes, you're the new boy from next door, ha ha! My name's Lime. Harvey Lime. Welcome to Expediting.
Ah. Would you mind if I borrowed your computer console?
What?
I'll bring it back in ten minutes.
You want to take my console into your office?
Yes.
Alright. There's someone I want to check out. A woman called Gillian Layton.
A woman eh? I see.
I know her age and distinguishing marks. But I need an address or a place of work or something
This is your dream girl, is it?
What? Look, let me use the console for a few minutes.
Sod it, it's broken!
You haven't switched it on.
Hey - that's my desk!
Lime, I need to use your computer
My mother said it would be all right.
She didn't say anything about it to me.
Well, she's my mother, not yours.
I won't be held responsible.
How long will she he away?
Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.
I'm sorry but ...
You remember Samuel, my son.
{suddenly unctious) Oh, but of course ...
Oh, to hell with the diet, a number eight, please.
Numero une, crevettes à la mayonaaise.
I just wish you would stop interfering, mother! I don't want promotion. I'm happy where I am.
Mr Helpmann was very close to your poor father. He was very close to me. Still is. He'll take you under his wing at Information Retrieval. You'll like it when you get there.
I hope you like it. It's very exclusive.
What is it?
What were we saying?
This isn't rare!
Actually, Alma, that's one of the little things I was dying to tell you ... Sam's been promoted to Information Retrieval.
Sam ... you haven't had dessert.
I'm sorry. I don' t want dessert. I don't want promotion. I don't want anything.
Mother? Is that you?
Of course. Isn't it wonderful? The bandages came of this afternoon. Come and join the fun. Everybody's here.
Is Mr Helpmann here?
Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
It seems you're the first person ever to turn down a promotion. He thinks you should see a doctor.
Sam!!!
Mother? ... What ... what's ... you've got to help me ...
It's a refund ... I'm afraid there was a mistake.
Mistake?
My husband's dead, isn't he?
Er ... I assure you Mrs Buttle, the Ministry is always very scrupulous about following up and eradicating error. If you have any complaints which you'd like to make, I'd be more than happy to send you the appropriate forms.
What have you done with his body?
Uh ...
Really, Sam - when are you going to do something about these terrorists?
Whatever happened to you?
There was a slight complication. Dr. Chapman says it often happens with a delicate skin like mine. Nothing to worry about. He's promised me I'll have these bandages off in a ...
Actually, there's someone I want to meet ...
Here we are! I'm going to leave you two lovebirds in peace.
Ah ... hello, Mrs Terrain. SAM lets go of the parcel and pushes JILL away. She moves off.
I think that'll hold it. Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you?
My complication had a complication, but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother?
Er, yes ...
I can't make up my mind whether to have a number one or a number two. What do you recommend, Spiro?
Between you and me, Madam, today the number two.
Numero huit, braised veal in wine sauce.
It's too exciting. I've left Dr Jaffe and gone to Dr. Chapman.
That's all right Ida ... it's just that he's such an artist. To him, cutting is so crude ... so primitive.
Hello - Central Services - I'm at 579B Block l9, Northwestern Section D - that's exit 1 on Green Pastures Highway at the Orange Blossom Flyover - and I've got trouble with the air- conditioning
Thank you or calling Central Services. am sorry, due to temporary staff shortage, Central Services cannot take service calls centrally between 2300 and 0900 hours - have a nice day - this has not been a recording, incident-
This is an emergency!
Thank you for calling Central Services. I am sorry, due -
Yes, but. I've got to have a heating engineer
Hello ... hello ...
Hello. Mr Lowry?
Put the phone down and your hands up.
My name is Sam Lowry. I have to report to Mr Warren.
Thirtieth floor, sir. You're expected.
Er, don't you want to search me?
No, sir.
My I.D. cards.
No need, sir
But I could be anybody.
Excuse me, Dawson, can you put me through to Mr Helpmann's office?
I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to go through the proper channels.
And you can't tell me what the proper channels are, because that's classified information?
I'm glad to see the Ministry's continuing its tradition of recruiting the brightest and best, sir.
Are we?
A steak, please. Rare. Mother, I need to ...
Monsieur. Quel numero.
I don't know which numero.
what? ... Oh ...
Yes?
No, not at all. I mean, it's all right. It's fixed.
I mean it fixed itself.
Now look what you've done to him.
Have you got one or haven't you?
But we can get one.
It's all right, Terry, it's all right, everything's all right.
I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of a stickler for paper work. Where would we be if we didn't follow the correct procedures?
What the - ? How did you - ?
Sign here please.
What is it?
What?
Hang on! Wait a minute! You can't just go and leave it like this!
For God's sake, what's happened?
What is it?
Nice and easy now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
Harry Tuttle. Heating engineer. At your service.
Tuttle! Are you from Central Services?
Ha!!
But ... I called Central Services.
They're a bit overworked these days. Luckily I intercepted your call.
A little precaution, sir. I've had traps set for me before now. There are people in Central Services who'd love to get their hands on Harry Tuttle.
Well, yes ... and no. Officially, only Central Service operatives are supposed to touch this stuff ... Could you hold these.
... but, with all the new rules and regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon ... they can't get decent staff any more ... so ... they tend to turn a blind eye ... as long as I'm careful. ... Mind you, if ever they could prove I'd been working on their equipment ... well, that's a different matter ... up a bit with the torch,
Sorry. wouldn't it be easier just to work for Central Services?
Couldn't stand the pa - ah - we're getting warm -
The pace?
The paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork. Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling
Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount
Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it! There's your problem.
Can you fix it?
Are you expecting anyone?
Listen .. um ... I don't want to get involved in any of this. But I work at the Ministry of Information, and I happen to know that Information Retrieval have been looking for an Archibald Tuttle, Heating Engineer. You wouldn't by any chance be -
My friends call me Harry. Information Retrieval, eh? Interesting!
What do they want you or?
Thank you very much. How much will it...?
What am I going to to do with this guy? Pierce, I was just on the phone with Borough Command. Out of twelve shifts this month, you've been late for nine, sick four and that includes the shift where you came late and went home early.
I'm sick. That's what I've been telling you.
You're killing me, you know that? You got no sick time according to Command. I've been told to terminate.
It's okay. I'll just get my things out of the locker.
I've never fired anyone in my life.
I'm sorry Captain. Don't take it too hard.
Nobody tells me to fire anyone. I told them: shove it up the big one. Sorry. I said, you want to fire him, come over and do it yourself.
You know they won't do it. It's up to you. You gotta be strong.
I feel for you, but we got an emergency here. It's a weekend of full moons. Everyone's called in sick. Larry, Veeber, Stanley too. We need bodies out there. I had to put Marcus on Twelve Young. You know he's not supposed to work two nights in a row.
You swore you'd fire me if I came in late again.
I'll fire you tomorrow. Hell, better than that, I'll forward you some sick time. A week, two weeks off-- how about that?
I don't think a week's gonna do it.
You're late, Pierce. I know, but I can't fire you. I've got nobody to work sixteen XRay with Walls.
No ...
I got some forms here to fill out about that accident when you get the time. I'll fire you tomorrow. I promise.
What if there is no tomorrow?
No English. She has terrible pain in her belly.
Pregnant.
No, no, that's impossible.
Can you walk? Puedes caminar?
She say she in great pain.
Is she dying?
She's having a baby. Twins.
Es impossible.
You can trust me on this one.
You know each other a long time?
Two years. Ever since we left island.
In that time, you ever have sex?
Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no booze.
No underwear?
Hey Cy, guess who's here?
It's okay, Kanita. Come on in.
He looks like a cop.
Frank, take it easy. what happened?
Be cool, man. You're having a paradoxical reaction. It can happen. Didn't I tell you this guy was stressed out?
Frank Pierce.
Mary said you might be coming.
Where is she?
Sleeping in the back.
She asked me to pick her up.
I know, but she told me to tell you she wants to crash here a few hours. Terrible about her father, isn't it?
She wanted something to help her sleep.
I'm always interested in people in stressful occupations and being a paramedic is about as stressful as I can imagine. Here, sit down. What's it like? Tell me some war stories.
That shit is poison, Frank. We don't drink alcohol here. What you need is one of these.
Did you give Mary something called Red Death?
Red Death? Tell me something, Frank--does killing your clients make good business sense to you? The kids selling that shit have no sense. They'll be taken care of, don't worry about that.
I should be going. I just quit.
Is this what you gave Mary?
I guess I'll be going.
Does that hurt?
They're gonna torch the fence. You're gonna feel the metal getting warm, maybe very warm.
So, Frank, am I going to live?
You're going to live.
I've been thinking about things. Meditating on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. Whatja do, stop for Chinese on the way over? There's plenty of food in my place.
I was tired. I needed a coffee.
What about Kanita?
Dead.
That's too bad. Get some money, a nice looking girl on your arm, and everyone wants to take a piece. Some kid I wouldn't let wash my Mercedes is in my house, shooting at me. Damn, I thought I could make it onto the balcony like Tiger. He's fat, that's why, falls faster. I'm trying to watch my weight, and look what happens. Am
No.
Twelve Young, I don't have time for your games. Now answer me or do I have to come out there myself?
I usually don't do calls before coffee. But I think it might do you some good. Twelve Young is here and I'm gonna take care of you, baby. Don't you worry about a thing, yahear, cause Marcus is alive and on arrival.
I'm not your baby, Young, I'm not your mother either. You're going to a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and Ninth, northeast corner. It's a club. Take the side entrance.
Twelve Young, answer the radio. I have a call for you.
She said to me, I love the way you talk on the radio.
I can't wait all night, Young. I'm holding a priority and if you don't answer I'm going to knock you out of service.
Don't worry, hon. Young is here and he's gonna help out--just remember, you owe me.
You're going to three-four Avenue C, 17 year-old female cardiac arrest, no further information.
Let's do it! It's Marcus, Love, only for you.
Male diff breather, approximately 30, Houston and A.
Okay, what happened?
He's going to be all right, right?
No. He's dead.
No way, man.
All right, all right, he's been snorting that Red Death stuff. Been going for four days.
What's his name?
IB Bangin.
Excuse me. You are a very kind man. I can see that. A man like you could not refuse a poor sick dying helpless man a small cup of water.
See, I can't do it. I came out of the desert.
You came out of the hospital. You were tied down and hallucinating. You got some bad chemicals in your head, Noel. There's some medicine at the hospital that will fix that.
Noel, you didn't let me finish. We have rules against killing people on the street. Looks bad, but there's a special room at the hospital for terminating. A nice quiet room with a big bed.
Oh man, do you mean that? Thank you man, thank you. How?
You're not going to die.
What did you say?
That's a hell of a swing you got there, Noel. I'm thinking Strawberry in his prime.
Here, you try.
No, I'd better not.
Sure, sure, give go.
What the hell. The next year, tiebreaker for the division, in Boston, Yanks down two to nothing, Bucky Dent steps to the plate.
Oh man, Bucky.
Do you have any music?
What?
Music. I think it helps if you play something he liked.
Is he going to be alright?
He's very very sick.
I know him. That's Noel.
Is there any chance?
I wouldn't do that. The doctor seems to think he's suffering from some rare disorder.
It's my first cigarette in over a year.
The first is always the best.
It's the waiting that's killing me, not knowing, you know? It's really hard on my mother. The doctor doesn't think my father'll make it. He says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door.
You never know.
I mean if he was dead, I could handle that.
At least he's got people around him.
I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto
Even when you say the things, there's always more things.
Right now, I'm more worried about my mother than anything. They won't let her see my father.
Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now.
You shouldn't smoke.
It's okay. They're prescription. Works better with a little whiskey.
That boy you brought in, he was shot, wasn't he?
Yes.
He's dead, huh?
Yes.
I think this place stinks.
Our Lady of Misery.
Did you see my father?
No.
It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.
He's working a double shift.
My father's in a coma, now my mother's going crazy. It's like she's in a trance.
She should go home.
Yes?
Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news.
He's better, isn't he?
Well, the doctor says he's showing some movement. It's still early, it might mean nothing, but I thought you'd want to know.
I knew. I sensed it when I heard your voice.
You look so different.
I know. It's awful, isn't it? Night of the Living Cheerleaders.
I think it looks good.
I was going nuts in that waiting room so I came back to check on my mom.
How is she?
Sleeping.
I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.
Be tough to get a taxi here. We can give you a ride if you like.
He wants to pull that tube out. It's pretty painful--that's why they keep him sedated--but it's a good sign.
That's how it's done. You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
He's better, though, right?
He's better.
My father was a great man, you know. There was nobody he wouldn't help. You know that crazy guy Noel who I gave water to last night? He lived in our house for almost a year. A total stranger he'd do anything for, his own family though ...
It's best not to ... It's good pizza, huh?
Not as good as Nino's.
You remember that pizza place, Joe's on Tenth Street maybe fifteen years ago? When you ordered a pie it came with a little plastic madonna in the middle?
Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?
I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
We moved out after that. Upstate.
Like everybody else--except us. Always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks. Your parents ... ?
They're fine. My old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse--I was sort of born to it, I guess.
You married?
It's been bad lately, but it's always bad.
How long you been doing this?
Five years.
Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?
You learn to sort of block it out, you know, like cops fence off a crime scene. But then something good will happen and everything will just glow.
You must get a lot of overdoses. I bet you picked me up a couple of times.
I think I'd remember that.
Maybe not. I was a different person then. Does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this?
Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest.
I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this.
Excuse me. You seemed like you were in trouble.
I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up. I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.
Don't seem so bad to me.
Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that. Look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a
I'm only asking because it's a dangerous building. There's been some robberies, a woman was raped not long ago. This woman I'm seeing, she'll want to talk to me all day, but if I can point to you out the window and say you're waiting, I can be out quick. if anything happens, I'll be in apartment 16M.
Maybe I should come up with you.
If I'm not back in fifteen minutes, hit the buzzer. That way she'll let me go.
Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you.
I shouldn't have asked you to come.
You asked me not to come.
Promise you won't go inside.
Fifteen minutes.
I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.
We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath.
Mary. Mary, we've got to get going.
You and CY have a nice talk? He tell you about Sunrise Enterprises, helping people? Well, I've seen him hurt people. Why are you following me?
What is it? You want to help me, you feel sorry for me? Keep it to yourself.
I need to sit down a minute.
I heard CY Coates was brought in. He looked pretty bad.
He'll be all right.
Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That
It'll be a while before he's up and running again.
OK, last night I was weak. it won't happen again. And all that shit I said--it was just because I was stoned. Forget it.
No problem. Thanks for letting me crash. It was the best sleep I've had in months. I used some of your soap.
I wish these people would leave already. I can't listen to another story. Did you see him? That doctor says the brain is coming around. They're waiting for the heart to stabilize. I don't know who to believe. He says they still have to keep him tied up.
Can I bring you something back to eat--a falafal, some pizza?
No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
This is not a good time.
Who is it?
Frank.
My Lord mother man, you look like hell. What were you drinking?
The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now.
Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last.
The ghosts--
You ever notice people who see shit always, are crazy?
I think the worst is over.
She only works when I'm on. I make her wait and it drives her crazy.
Is it true that you and Love went on a blind date? She hit you with a bottle?
He's not dead. It's a heroin overdose. Break out the Narcon.
I ever tell you about the time years ago I was on this ledge uptown, trying to talk this psycho inside?
Where the guy jumped and you almost fell. No, you never told me that story.
No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.
Who's that?
She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest I brought in last night. I told her we'd give her a ride back to Misery. Her father's showing signs of improving.
Oh, Frank, you've got it bad, so much worse than I thought.
I'm hungry too. We gotta get some food after this.
Went over to Sal's got this. There must be some place in Hell for a guy who sells a dollar-fifty a slice. I call you if anything comes up.
Rule number one: Don't get involved with patients. Rule number two: Don't get involved with patient's daughters. You understand?
What about rule number three: Don't get involved with dispatchers named Love.
Nice though, pulling back her hood as we drive by. There's a mystery to it, then she shows you.
She's no whore, Marcus.
We're all whores, Frank. You know what I'm talking about, the way she looked at me.
No, you didn't, Frank, thank you. But there's still a couple hours left on the shift.
Look at that. A fat junkie. That's a first.
It's coming. Hold her down.
What's that, Frank?
Three legs.
That's too many.
Backup?
Don't give me that look.
What look?
You know what I'm talking about. It's all over your face. That I-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look.
We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it that way.
I hate vodka.
Please, a little decorum if you will. What I was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, I felt like I was twenty-one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the drinking.
I'll drink to that.
Here's to the greatest job in the world.
Where you going?
I quit! I'm through!
He got better.
He one of them?
That guy I brought in yesterday, post-cardiac arrest. He's gone.
Burke. You won't believe it. He's showing cognitive signs. He started with spontaneous respiration, now he's fighting to pull out the tube. Had to sedate him. He's in a CAT scan. I'm giving him every test I can: thromboytics, steroids, nitrodrips, heparin.
What do you think?
Who knows? It's all lower-brain-stem- activity. The heart refuses to stabilize--he's coded eleven times since he got here. This guy's a fighter. Every time the Valium wears off he starts yanking those restraints.
The family know?
Oh Jesus, put her on the monitor. Where's the pediatric code cart? Odette give me that tube. All right, flatline--let's do CPR. step back, Frank. How many months?
You can't believe how much he's improved.
How many times have you shocked him tonight?
Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours.
What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?
That's good, Frank. No, but they might surgically implant one, about the size of my thumb. It goes near the shoulder here, with two electrodes connected to the heart. It sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. Amazing, isn't it?
Last show of the night.
Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp! Anybody else hurt?
No.
Where's Burke?
He's dead, Rose. Your father passed.
How can that be? He was getting better.
He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry.
He was tough. You did all you could.
I'm sorry.
Would you like to come in?
It's not worth it, Tom. He's surrendering.
I'm sick, Tom. I need a cure. Vitamin B cocktail, followed by an amp of glucose and a drop of adrenaline. Not as good as beer, but all I got.
These are hard times, Tom.
Yeah. Great, isn't it?
Great to be drunk. Sobriety's killing me.
Look up, Frank. Full moon. The blood's gonna run tonight. I can feel it. Our mission: to save lives.
Our mission is coffee, Tom. A shot of the bull, Puerto Rican espresso.
The cure's not working, Tom. Maybe we should go back to the hospital.
Tom, where are the Band-aids? This is an ambulance, isn't it?
Where you going?
Whatja doing?
I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself.
The brakes are shot.
I've taken that into consideration.
You okay?
Mr. Oh.
It's early for him.
Whadda we bring?
Get this, Frank--we got two patients. Number one, the scarecrow outside. Number two misses the railing but breaks both legs on the balcony, then throws himself through a glass window, heads to the bedroom, where he's now passed out.
Well, he's the steakhead of the night, then.
I don't think the fire people can touch him out there.
How's he doing?
Get ready, Frank. Missed a drug shooting while you were dicking around in there. There's gonna be trauma tonight!
As long as we keep moving. No standing still.
C'mon, Tom, pick up a job.
You want some bum in the bus terminal? We'll wait for a real call.
Let's get in a fight, then.
Who with?
Let's break something, Tom. Let's bust something, bomb something.
What do you want to break?
I don't know--let's break some windows.
Why?
Destruction, distraction. I feel the need.
You need a reason, Frank. You don't just go around breaking people's windows. That's anarchy.
What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom.
This guy's been terrorizing the neighborhood for weeks, ever since he got outta jail, wreaking general havoc, contributing to the bad name of the place. The term "menace to society" was made up for him.
He's crazy. He can't help it.
Look at that. Tell me that's a crazy person. Every move is calculated. He knows exactly what he's doing. This is the guy. I've been after him for weeks. He's quick, runs like a rat, tough for one person, but with two of us--
Okay, whatta I do?
If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him.
That's ridiculous.
Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better.
Get the kit! We're gonna tube him!
Frank!
Do it!
Frank!
We're gonna save you, Noel. You're gonna be all right. Do it, Tom! I'll call for fucking backup, I swear!
No we can't. He's got a pulse.
The Chinese close in five minutes. Beef lo mein. It's been on my mind since I woke. Whatjathink?
I think the moment that food hits your mouth we'll get a job.
Oh no!--I just remembered.
What?
I'm so stupid. I had beef lo mein last night. I can't eat the same thing two nights in a row. It's almost two o'clock, what the hell am I gonna do? What you getting?
I'm not hungry.
Oh yeah, you don't eat food.
I eat. I just haven't had coffee yet.
Turn it off.
What?
You wanted it turned off. There's no such thing as a good fire. People get burned up. They can't breathe.
That's what we're here for. Come on, Frank.
Don't push it, Larry.
Mr. Oh.
Relax, it's a street job, easy except for the smell. We'll just throw him in back and zip over to Mercy--no blood, no dying, that's how I look at it. He's just a drunk.
It's not our job to taxi drunks around.
They'll just keep calling.
Well why didn't you say so?
Faster! God!
Larry, swing over on Eighth. We're gonna hafta run one of these calls.
I'm not feeling very well, Larry. I say we go back to the hospital and call it a night.
You have no sick time, Frank. No time of any kind. Everyone knows that.
Take me back, put me to bed; I surrender. We've done enough damage tonight.
You take things too seriously. Look at us, we're cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. We've got a good job here.
Tell me, you ever think of doing anything else?
He's crazy.
Jesus, Tom Walls, that crazy motherfucker.
You're in the stomach!
You're in the stomach! Let me try.
Stomach again.
One-three Zebra. Zebra three, I need you.
You see, he's giving it to us anyway.
Zebra, are you there? I'm holding an unconscious at First and St. Marks.
Answer the radio Zebra. You know it's that time.
Four times this week I've had him. Aren't there any other units out there? Don't answer the radio. They'll give it to someone else.
Look, Frank, when I say don't answer it, that means answer it. You can do that for me at least. Three Zebra.
Yes, Zebra. You'll be driving to the man who needs no introduction, chronic caller of the year three straight and shooting for number four. The duke of drunk, the king of stink, our most frequent flier, Mr. Oh.
Shit, shit, shit...
Okay if I watch you tape that interview downstairs?
One source referred to it as a five billion dollar metal sculpture to ugly to look at and too big to bury.
...outlaw nation but strangely those who have interviewed Gaddafi find him, in a phrase we like to use in this country, very 'presidential'.
Hi, Aaron...What's doing?
You want to go out there -- get out of this for a second?
What did I do to you?
How <u>you</u> doing?
Great. Network news, Washington... I love it. What do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams?
Keep it to yourself.
You know the other day I really wanted your reaction to how we did with the Libyan report -- I was going to ask but I guess I feel a little intimidated with you.
You can't talk about feeling intimidated when you're on top of the world. It's unseemly.
I'm not buying into any of that. I have a load to learn. I'm not going to act as if...
Shut up a second...
Okay. Pretty petty party, isn't it, pal?
I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...
And the rule was...
Never to pretend to know more than I did.
Can you name all the members of the Cabinet?
Okay, let's drop it. I didn't mean I'd take a test for you -- I mean if that came up in conversation I'd...
Don't name them. Just tell me if you know.
Yes, Aaron. I know the names of the Cabinet.
Yes.
You're feeling good, aren't you?
I'm starting to... We may do the capitols of the states.
I'm in a pissy mood. I'm sorry.
What's wrong with it?
This is uncomfortable for me -- because, well, I don't mean it as a knock, but we approach this differently.
We sure do. I don't mean it as a knock either. Go ahead. I'll just say what I think and you can disregard it if you want.
Wait.
What?
I don't like being handled.
Sit on it! <u>Now</u> look.
No. That's not going to tell us anything. Let's get this prompter going.
It's not loaded.
No. No.
No?
Don't let your eyes go from the beginning of the sentence to the end like that. You don't want to look shifty, do you?
Oh, God, no!
You were smokin' toward the end there.
Everybody has one like that. I thought it was great when you started to laugh at the end.
Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying up Jane, I didn't realize you two would be going this late. Sorry.
No. Don't worry about it.
What did they do with you?
They booted me out of Washington.
Impossible. There's no system that wouldn't value one of us.
You packing up tonight?
Yes. And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?
London.
London. That's a promotion!
I don't think so.
It is. Yes -- that's where they had Rorish, for God's sake, before they made him anchor. I can't stand it -- they're grooming you for it all and you don't even know it.
Hold it down, okay?
Yes. You're not going to stick around for the farewell party?
This story they won't cover. And if the network doesn't cover it -- it must not be important so why worry.
You know what I...
Hi.
I'm just bringing him over to give Jane a look at him --
I thought she'd be here. I'll go with you.
Okay.
He excels at gratitude.
It's nice to see you.
Congratulations on history's longest winning streak.
If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know.
It's Mr. Buddy Felton?
Yes.
That's your full name?
Yes.
I might as well ask you the questions on tape. Is that all right?
Yes.
You worked at one time as Foreign Service Trainee in the State Department.
I was there two years and was promoted on merit nine times.
Eventually rising to...
You're saying the fact that you're gay had something directly to do with your promotions?
I don't like the word gay.
Which would you prefer?
Ravenous homosexual.
Hi. Turn on your TV... <u>Good Morning America</u>, the <u>Morning News</u> and <u>Today</u> are all about to talk to Arnold Schwarzenegger and I think he's live on at least two of them.
At six o'clock on the wake-up news they used the wrong missile graphic.
Now listen, Arnold just said that he's been making three million a movie now. But he's not ever gonna change. He's still the same person when he was making two million dollars a movie. He feels no different. He also bought a brand- new condo with Maria, they gonna furnish tastefully.
A half hour in the lobby.
Where's where I asked him about being scared? You should work on your speech.
He must have been great-looking, right?
Why do you say that?
Okay. Let's do me.
Sure.
Okay. I feel like I'm slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think they're slipping because their standards are so high?
This conversation is not worthy of you.
I'd give anything if that were true.
Good night.
Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive? If needy were a turn-on?
They didn't hire Peter Stiller from the <u>Times</u> and he had a great audition tape.
Nine seconds.
Eleven and a half.
I didn't sleep. They're giving me less and less air time. They don't think I'm at all anchor material.
If we don't get to their camp soon, we won't be able to tape the supplies coming in.
Last time Paul was sick they gave Connie the weekend news instead of me.
Okay. Great line at the end.
Did you shoot their boots?
Of course.
We can cut back at the end.
To the pan of the supplies boxes --
I write for you sometimes.
What happened?
I'll tell you later -- where you going to watch from?
Watch? --
I think the pilot that shot down the Libyan in 1981 is stationed right here. Maybe you could get him -- and maybe Tom should say that our F-14 is one of the hardest planes to fly. They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'.
Me again. Hi. Listen Gaddafi doesn't foam at the mouth or anything. When you speak to him he's not at all nuts. He seems like a leader -- very impressive, self-control...that's what's so strange.
Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him.
Well, whatever you think.
I figured out exactly why it is I'm so hung up on getting a chance at weekend anchor...It's because if I do that well, they'll pay me more, treat me great and my life will be better. That's why.
Sounds like you may be on to something.
You know you've had a strange day... I'd sleep on all these things you've been thinking.
Absolutely...You go have a good time... You have some place to go?
Yes.
Jesus, Jane. How long have you been here?
Aaah -- -- ello. You sure they said the management meeting? They want me to be at the management meeting.
Tom...why don't I meet you there? I've got some last minute stuff I've got to take care of...Hey, how did you resolve your dilemma -- did you rent the tux or buy it...I knew it. How much? Wow...Okay...See you there...
I didn't know you were going with him.
Did you bring your grey suit?
I read about it -- that's how you can make sure you don't put on too much perfume...
Could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you -- me showing up while you're getting ready for a date.
Because this is important -- so don't just be polite. I'd really like to look...what's the word I'm looking for?...
As good as humanly possible.
Yes.
Well, the line of the jacket -- No really....just very nice...just right. I wish I could be there.
Me too...Hey...if it gets dull a little before 11:00, drop by the studio.
I'm not sure I'll be able to...I...
<u>If</u>...if not, I'll have the tape...I'll wait for you at my apartment.
Thanks, Jane. Have a good time tonight.
How'd it go?
You didn't see it or speak to anybody?
No.
Then it went well.
Did it really go well?
Define your terms.
Do you feel good about it?
No.
Do others feel that you did well?
No.
Then what was good about it?
I lost six pounds...
Aaron, will you tell me?
It was great...writing my little first rate copy, sitting on my jacket, punching my one thought. But I had this historic attack of flop sweat so they'll never let me another again. Oh, I lost one of your shoulder pads -- how was your evening anyway?
What do you mean, flop sweat? -- you're making too much out of it...I'll bet you were the only one aware of it...
People phoned in.
Stop kidding. I want to know what happened.
I'm not kidding.
There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?
No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack.
If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?
I don't know. At a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny. My central nervous system was telling me something. Jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which
I told what's his name -- Tom -- that I'd meet him.
Call him -- I mean it can wait, right?
I don't know. I may be in love with him.
Don't go.
This is important to me.
What?
Aaach...Jane... Let's take the part that has nothing to do with me. Let's let me be your most trusted friend, the one that gets to say awful things to you. You know?
Yes, I guess. Yes.
You can't end up with Tom because it goes totally against everything you're about.
Yeah -- being a basket case.
I know you care about him. I've never seen you like this about anyone, so please don't take it wrong when I tell you that I believe that Tom, while a very nice guy, is the Devil.
This isn't friendship.
I think you're the Devil.
No. You know that I'm not.
How?
You were quick enough to get Tom's help when...
I've got to not say that aloud; it takes too much out of me.
Don't say anything about anything.
Bastard, sneak, quitter.
Speaking.
Why not try it for a few weeks?
Stop. Ernie thought I was good too -- he couldn't help. My agent has a hot prospect -- the number two station in Portland. The general manager says he wants to be every bit as good as the networks. Personally, I think he should aim higher.
Tell me the God's honest truth -- are you leaving because of me? Because if you are...
Ernie told this story. How he used to write obits and when the people in town called him up with death notices, he cried. He was till that way when they promoted him out of obits. He says you're lucky if you can get out while you could still cry. I should have quit this place three years ago.
Let's go...
I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
You are now required to sit here with me. Come on...be smart for a second -- what do you think will happen to us?
Okay, that's very easy. Five, six years from now I'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations.
Yes.
I'll be walking with my wife and two children -- we'll bump into you on the street, my youngest son will say something and I'll tell him... ...it's not nice to make fun of single, fat ladies.
You won't be able to stay mad at me, right?
I think so...They've been talking to me about being Tom's Managing Editor.
Really?
So who's the guy?
I like it! So, doll, what about you lately?
Ready.
Your hair's a little funny.
It's an ethnic curl, I can't do anything about it.
In front of a little -- it's a bit... You want a mirror?
Okay.
Oh, you mean use him...That's nice. Okay.
I'll put him in the low corner of the frame -- good.
I saw the smile -- good piece.
I had the strangest thing happen yesterday. Anne and I have been married what? -- Thirty-six years... Everything fine -- two days after the promotion came through, I was checking myself in the mirror and she was making a face at me behind my back. So yesterday I looked in the mirror and she was doing it again.
That's it. I resign as of now.
Stop it.
Oh, I was just writing you a note. What do you say we take a walk?
Outside?
I don't know if we have any younger man more respected in our operation than you.
Just tell me what's really going on. I think we know each other well enough for me to expect that.
We know each other well enough for me to care how I put something to you which could wipe you out. So I will phrase things the way I think they should be phrased. All right?
Anyway. I want you to think of this as...
Just blunt talk, okay? I'd really appreciate bluntness.
Aaron, I've never seen them like this -- I think Paul's nervous about his own job and for some reason he thinks you only appeal to...
Wait. Bullshit me a little...I'm beginning to appreciate it.
I'm no suggesting the worst will happen...but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe, the next time that happens, down the road -- you should look into it.
Ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- My, God. They want to fire me.
All I know is that they've got to fire a large number of people... and they're not going by seniority. There's a recklessness in the air. They...
Do one thing to me? Get me one shot at anchoring the Weekend News -- they've never seen me do it. I think it could turn them around.
Do it then.
Please prepare carefully. This couldn't come at a better time.
Prepare what? You have Saturday's news handy?
Okay. I think I'd better be alone for a while.
I understand. I'll go with you.
It's what he did. I'm proud of him.
They told me they'd keep me because they could plug me into any story and my salary was in line.
The cost-efficient reporter.
Just a few questions?
We came from Washington.
Move away from me.
How long has it been since you've been home.
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuckes. Snot... Fuckee. You want to use that?
All this business of war -- do you get scared?
Okay. I just wanted you to know.
What is she shooting?
Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'
Norman Rockwell's enduring portrait of a <u>Homecoming</u> The return of a fighting man has always been one of the more moving ceremonies of war... Tearful women, proud men, excited children. But J.D. Singer was right -- his homecoming was no big deal.
I was a little nervous there for a minute.
Goodbye, Paul.
Take care, Paul. It takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the President of the News Division.
You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.
No. I think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser.
Just when do you start, telling people?
Almost immediately.
I'd like to take everyone out after the show.
Bill...This is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. But I think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
This is a brutal layoff...And all because they couldn't program Wednesdays.
Jane?
Yes.
Well, darling, if it gets any better than that, I'm going to have to bring you up here to New York.
But thanks.
Aaron should be hearing this so I have an extra witness.
Well, you always want to give the credit away, do you?
No, I don't. He happens to deserve the credit. He's right here.
You don't have time. Not a chance.
I've got to tell Ernie...because there isn't enough time.
What did he say?
Yeah, I know, I went back and forth on it.
Tell George and Jessica to try and cover everything without Tom having to ask additional questions.
And Bobbie says...
Did you hear what I just said -- do you have that? Take a breath.
It's Aaron.
Do you know you're the second woman in network news history to produce?
What are you dressed up for? Oh, that's right -- because the Evening News is here this week.
They canned me. Well, my brother will feel great -- now he's not the only screw-up.
Go back to 316, Bobbie. The sound bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I don't know how I'll feel...'
We could...
Play back the last line...
He said something about...
Okay, Bobbie, just a two-second dissolve to the Rockwell.
Should I...
Do you want him all the way to the car?
No stop where he's all besieged.
Because...
You know, I like Tom, because hi...
They're not really going to call security are they?
No, I don't think so.
How do I get out of here?
Follow me.
I've been doing some morning show stuff, but mostly radio -- that doesn't bother me. I'm in no rush for anything. It's just the snotty attitude, even if I have it coming, it's still...
Bad manners.
Yes. That's right.
I know...I mean you didn't do anything special for me tonight. You just had what I think are good manners, decency. And it really makes me want to be nice back and it has nothing to do with any homosexual thing. Honestly. Because I don't know if you've homosexual or not and -- you're not, are you?
No...no.
I really have to go.
Okay. At least let me show my appreciation. The Secretary of Labor is going to be indicted on Wednesday. For the graft thing he supposedly did before he was appointed.
What?
Yes, it's true. They're going to make it public Wednesday but isn't it a big deal for you to have it a day and a half early?
Yes. How do you know?
...and the White House is hoping to keep a lid on it for a few days till they figure out what to do.
Thanks a lot, Buddy.
Oh, please. So they were really impressed with you at work.
Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.
Forgive me, but it really is intoxicating being a news source.
Nobody else had it.
I wish it were you giving the story.
That's okay.
What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story?
No. Really...don't worry about it.
Okay. And look, in the future I can call you when I have news for you. Don't feel you have to spend time with me just to get the information. Well, that wasn't as hard to say as you thought, was it, Buddy?
Hey, Buddy, don't do that anymore.
Is everything all right?
Yes. You didn't have to come here. It's just that I'm going to anchor this special report on this Libyan thing...
Anchor?
Yes, stop! I wondered if you could find out anything about what's happening. What's wrong?
I broke up with my roommate -- He was really the magnet for everyone who knew anything.
Oh.
Look, I can start up with him again if you really...
Good. He's on the world's longest ego trip, let him take it alone.
Hey, okay. Look Buddy -- I've got to go to work.
...good-bye then.
I'll speak to you.
Ernie, they're calling from work.
Tell me I'm on the way in.
What?
How horrible. We'll be fine. You'll be fine. Stay here with me -- we'll go for a drive, have some drinks, make happy plans.
No. They're firing even more people than they said. Some will want to talk. It could help.
Bye, sweetie.
...am starting to get jealous. I read in the newspapers about the Italian strike and riots in Milan. I hope you weren't...
Jane -- For God's sake... Look, it's time for you to go to sleep.
I just have two more pen pals and then I'm done.
You don't have to finish tonight.
Nooo. This way the rotation stays the same.
I don't know a recent Saturday I've sold more. You didn't think I'd sell that health restaurant, did you?
No. Not even you.
Why so glum?
I don't know.
Go ahead.
No, nothing. I've got a problem, I guess.
Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
You know, Tom, I feel a little proud when people comment on your looks. Maybe you should feel that way.
Proud? I'm just embarrassed that I like when they say those things.
As long as that's your only problem you're...
I got my report card. Three Cs, two Ds and an incomplete.
Oh my. I see you studying so hard, Tom. What do you think the problem is?
Thanks, Dad, this talk helped. Will you sign it, please?
Would it help if I got you a tutor?
Tom isn't ready for the job you're about to hand him. Not near ready. Not by the longest shot. Aaron's spent six weeks in Tripoli, he's interviewed Gaddafi -- he reported on the Eight-one story. I think he's essential to do the job we're capable of and I think it's my responsibility to tell you that.
Okay, that's your opinion. I don't agree.
It's not opinion.
It must be nice to always believe you know better. To think you're always the smartest person in the room.
I had no idea she was this good.
Hi.
I just wanted to tell you how great you were. My name's Tom Grunick.
Thank you. They hated me. I don't hate them.
Hi. I was worried I was early.
I kept thinking what a great break it was for me to get to see you tonight. More than a great break, maybe just what I needed...just when I needed it...Angel of mercy -- godsend...lifesaver...what?
I like "godsend."
If we could just eat first.
Totally understood. Totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you've had. Totally sorry.
Another thing I can't stand is ...when White House reporters bullshit with each other after a briefing and then one of them has a theory and the other quotes it in his story as "White House" sources say...
That actually goes on...
Yes. My room is down here -- I'm not tired. Do you want to keep talking?
Come on...Even I'm not that hard on myself.
I was doing sports at the station. The newspaper ran this untrue story that I was leaving and they got all these tons of protest mail. So they made me anchor.
So great -- right?
Except I'm no good at what I'm being a success at.
Listen to me. You keep on thinking I'm somebody ho lacks...confidence. That's not it. I know I can talk well enough and I'm not bad at making contact with people, but I don't like the feeling that I'm pretending to be a reporter. And half the time I don't really get the news I'm talking about. It isn't that I'm down on myself. Trust
I trust you.
I didn't even have the chance to get really good at sports. I wasn't bad. I thought I was starting to do interesting features but hockey is big at the station and...
What about the obvious remedy? Reversing things. Maybe getting a job on a newspaper.
But that didn't stop me from sending out audition tapes to bigger stations and the networks.
Well, come on -- it is your life. Nobody is tying you to the fast track. Did you go to college?
One year...almost one year.
It's hard for me to advise you since you personify something that I truly think is dangerous.
Uh-huh.
Whoa, this was a mistake.
I never told you the reason I was telling you everything for.
Hey?
They said it would be okay if...
I'm sorry if I was in the way. It was totally impressive. Great piece.
You weren't. Thanks. How does it feel being here?
I can't believe I'm really here. No kidding. If you're through work now --
No. Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.
I thought you were incredible in there. I know how much I have to learn. I'd really -- a lot -- appreciate it...if...
'Really a lot appreciate it...'
I can't help you, sorry. I'm not here to teach remedial reporting.
Hi.
How's it going?
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
So he was indicted?
Give it to him -- so we can concentrate.
I've got another story.
Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
The House Armed Service Committee has a secret report which says that the General Stillwell tank the Army has dumped a fortune into plain won't work. I have it cold, confirmed. They have five million dollars in this thing already.
Billion.
It's the firs time I've seen you dressed like this. You look so clean and pretty.
What do you mean clean?
At work there's always this sort of film over you.
Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.
You okay?
Nervous?
We're going to George. Say 'the Joint Chiefs are meeting -- we have George Weln at the Pentagon'.
You're an amazing woman. What a feeling having you inside my head.
Yeah. It was an unusual place to be.
You have to celebrate with me, don't you? Everybody's going to that bar on the corner, 'Caps.'
Jane?
Yeah?
I'll wait for you till seven.
I didn't think you'd make it.
Well, I thought I'd check if all of you were still here. I'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on.
There's no gang in there -- We were the last ones.
Well, I'll go in and have a bite.
Jennifer, you want to have another drink?
Come on, I'll buy you a drink. There's a big thing over at the Italian embassy.
I'm not sure I'd be good company tonight.
It's much too soon for you to have this kind of buzz around you.
Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
Maybe we could just sit here -- talk a little?
Okay. You didn't like the party, huh?
I'm going to have to do a story from beginning to end on my own.
Eventually. Does it have to be right now?
Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.
What?
I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.
Well, what is it?
If I tell you, can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it won't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that?
I'm not sure I dialed right -- Jane?
Jane, yes. Tom? Tom, is that you? Is this Tom?
Yes.
I had to sleep fast so I took two allergy pills to help me...I'm sorry...Hey, you called me.
It's not important.
Says who? Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
What pills did you take? You sound more like someone on a general anesthetic. Maybe I'd better speak to you tomorrow.
Nooo. Is it your story?
No. Are you going to the Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?
Why, you need me for the story?
No. Were you going to you?
Uh-huh.
Maybe I'll get off work. I'd like to go.
Oh, good.
So you like me, huh?
So what did you think?
It moved me. I did relate to it -- I really did. It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff. Okay?
It's incredible who's here.
Who?
Suppose I go in for a little while and you wait in the lobby-bar. How's that?
You're not going to take off on me, are you?
You okay?
Why can't I let go of this woman?
At least kiss me when you do that.
You just can't stop editing me. Huh?
I was half hoping I wouldn't have a good time tonight. You know why?
Because you're nuts.
I don't remember saying anything like that -- exactly...I don't know why I just did.
Oh let's see -- wait a minute, well, I can think of two reasons.
What?
Three...I just thought of a third... If you talk about it, you don't have to do it.
That's not it.
I forgot all about Aaron. I promised to stop by and see how he did.
I'd like to know. I'll go along.
What happened?
Don't run off -- like everything's settled the minute you make up your mind.
He might be weird -- he can talk more freely if I go alone -- why's that so hard to understand?
It's not that it's hard. I just want you to give me a minute to catch up.
Hi. It's me.
Where are you?
I can't get away just yet. I'm at Aaron's.
Well, when?
I'm not sure. It seems like he had sort of a mishap on the news.
I know. I taped it.
It wasn't as bad as he think, was it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or anything?
Hi, again. Sorry about...
No. That sounds more important. Let's forget about tonight.
I don't know if that's absolutely necessary.
I've got my father coming through tomorrow anyway. I should get some sleep.
Uh-huh.
Hello?
Yes.
Okay. Good night.
Good night??!
Jane, I'm not some chore you have to finish so you can stay on schedule.
I feel terrible about what happened. What did he say?
He -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty.
No. Did he really?
Yes. Then he said a really weird thing...
What?
That it would be a treat to make someone like you feel better... He gets like that sometimes.
Maybe I haven't been here long enough. But, hey, congratulations on the promotion.
How can you say that to me?
Well, I just think that' an extraordinary proposal.
That's yes?
Then give me a minute...
Why?
I felt funny about it afterwards. It's verboten, huh? I thought since I did it for real the first time -- but I get you. That's not the reason you're not coming?
Of course it's the reason. It's terrible what you did.
We disagree on how God-awful it was. Why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time?
Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it. I was up all night and...
Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...
It made me ill. You could get fired for things like that.
I got promoted for things like that.
Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between...
It's hard not to cross it; they keep moving the little sucker, don't they?
It just proves that the difference we have are...
This is a one-way argument. We've got six days; if you go and we fight and we hate it -- we'll come home. If you don't go? Well, that's a much bigger deal. I go to London right after that. So, it'd be very big deal if you stay here. The plane's boarding. You're good at deadline. Here's your ticket.
It's amazing. You commit this incredible breach of ethics and you act as if I'm nitpicking. Try and get this. When you edited that...
That's not going to be the way we say good-bye. Even though I think what you did was rotten -- it's not all impersonal. You mean something to me.
I don't wan to discuss work.
Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news.
I knew what you meant.
You're lucky I came after you so you got that off your...
Yes, I am. Thanks. I mean it.
So you have an extra bathing suit, huh?
You want to come?
It's just that one of the few things I'm not confused about is what I was saying downstairs, that...
Then you should stay here.
Take it easy.
Well, why not? Hey, what is this? My life's rushing in front of my eyes.
A picnic?
What a great surprise. I didn't think we had a chance. I heard you wanted to stay in Washington.
Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll fly up a lot.
Well, we should talk. You going to have time for dinner? I'd like you to meet Lila.
I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.
This is very awkward.
Go ahead -- what?
Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but I see Tom around you a lot and this is such a small office and I'd like to see him outside of work, unless there's some reason for you to mind... in which case I just won't do anything.
God Almighty -- Whew. Do I mind? Why do I mind? I do mind. What a shock -- I don't have a right to... I don't think I like him. I know I don't respect him...So what am I talking about -- what am I saying to you?
You're saying stay away from him.
I sure know that feeling. Terrific work today.
So he bought this Peugeot sedan at a greatly reduced price while he was there in charge of the White House Advance Team.
How come you're not chasing it down yourself?
Look, I'm junior man -- and it's your beat.
Boy, that's nice...I wish we could all deal with each other like this. I'll check it. Anything I can do for you?
This is my first time at the White House. Is there any chance to look at where he works and the rest of it?
The last time I was with someone we went through this awful mutual disease questionnaire but I guess it beats getting paranoid the next day. Okay, I'll go first. I haven't...
Where's the bathroom?
I converted a bedroom -- this stuff builds up. Wait till you've been doing this sixteen years.
That's enough. That's enough.
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
Yes, I'm sorry.
Don't be silly. What are you sorry about?
I just need you for another minute now, so we can shoot from behind towards me, and, um...
Uh-huh.
Don't you work here?
Would you like to do me?
I just might.
That's not true I am a sculptor!
If you were an artist you could have created something!
What are you doing here?
Listen schmuck, why don't you get out of here and let me go to bed!
I didn't finish talking to you!
Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!
Well I'm touched. You're serious, aren't you?
Yes. Fifty dollars an hour, right?
Tonight.
What, right now?
It's kind of dark -
I'm almost ready -
That doesn't look like very much clay.
Oh it's enough...
Are you nervous, Walter?
Not even a little bit?
I already told you I'm not.
When's the last time you had a totally nude girl in your room...
Um...
A girl with a body like mine?
Walter can I ask you something?
What!
It's just an innocent question. Besides I just wanted to clarify your intentions.
Whaddya mean?
Look - This pose is all wrong!
Alright we're clear.
Anything new?
Not really. One girl who fit the descrip came in, kinda skinny, brunette, didn't see much changing hands.
Is the manager cooperating?
Yeah, he's keeping an eye out, said he'd call us if he sees anything. That's about it for tonight.
Alright I got you, man. It's my turn for freak patrol.
What the hell's going on?
Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
What did he do?
See you later -
Don't worry about him...what have you got?
I've never seen anything like this, maybe Segal, but nothing with such... dichotomy... It's very good, Walter -
You really like it?
Great! What is it?
It's a...full length life-size figure!
What's it called?
It's called spontaneity, Leonard. Get with the program.
Look at the size of it!
It's not really that big I got it on kind of a stand...
Let's see it.
Uh, well, I'm a little nervous, I never did a person before.
Like it? It's a masterpiece. I've never seen anything like it before... and I hope I never see anything like it again. Walter smiles and looks at his creation -
How did you ever find it all in yourself, Walter?
Gee..twenty five dollars for something I made!
Hi Walter.
These guys came by to help me try out some of my new organic recipes.
What's up, Walter?
I came over to see you. I brought something...I wanted to show you.
Oh yeah?
Is it murdered man?
You think she's better than Murdered Man?
More champagne, your majesty?
Where where...
May I please have another little kiss?
Walter! Jeez!
Did you hear what he said?
Yes Walter.
It's true, isn't it?
I know what it is to be ignored.
Tell us what you're going to make next, Walter.
I mean, you look so pretty.
Thank you.
Are you ready?
Ready? We've got plenty of time.
Goodbye.
Nice night out...
Well...what did you want to talk to me about?
Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?
Oh, I don't know. Smart people. Creative people I guess.
You think I'm creative?
Of course I do!
I like you very much, Walter.
Well that was for your sculpture of the girl. Your nude in the chair.
- even though Leonard's always asking you to go out with him and I - just -
Uh... ...how long have you been thinking about this, Walter?
But you gotta love me! Why do you think I made that statue of Alice?!
Walter, I'm sorry...
Now calm down Walter! Now, let's go in there, and when the show's over, maybe we can talk about it.
No! I want to talk about it now!
Walter... I don't want to hurt your feelings but there is no way we're ever going to get...together. You know what I mean?
Why not?!
Because... We're just friends. That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it. I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?
I'm sorry about what I said before.
Forget it.
I've been thinking... Carla, would you do one favor for me?
Just about anything, Walter.
Would you really like to? That would make me very happy.
Walter...there's...
What?
Walter...stay away from me!
That's word for word.
Here you go, enjoy.
I hope this was made with egg whites!
It was.
What's this sauce! I'm lactose intolerant.
Don't worry it's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk.
Put it in the middle of the room!
Walter...I can't believe it.
Ah, your new head shot... I like it, very much...
I'm trying to find a style of my own. Do you really like them?
Hi Walter...
Maybe so...
You've arrived. You've been recognized. You're a talent, a creative force to be reckoned with.
Are you trying to be funny?
Murdered...man?...
Are you alright?
Yeah, I'm feeling a lot better.
What's the matter with you?
Nothing...nothing at all.
I've never seen anyone so... squeamish. Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?
Don't ask.
Well then admit it, it's a work of genius.
No. Why don't you cover it up Walter...
Why not?
What's wrong with you, why do you want to hide it?
Well, I've been thinking... I didn't realize how much...talent Walter actually had. It would be wrong for us to show them one at a time. Dead wrong.
It will take years to make that many statues. But your work would be featured.
That's the idea, Walter. It's the only way to gain recognition. All the big art critics and art dealers would be there, it would be an event.
Carla and I will guide you, help develop and evolve your work...maybe lead you toward something more abstract...
Abstract? With his talent for realism?
Would you pose for me for free?
It's our road kill series. I take the pictures.
Yeah, can you say plagiarism?
Look at that, man. Big deal.
I know.
I mean it's like, you know, I do my art because that's what I am, you know? I'm an artist. I'm not like a banker, you know. Like I create.
I know, man.
But it bugs me when someone rips off our ideas, our concepts, and people freak out about it, you know, and tell us ours stinks!
I know, man.
I mean, screw them, you know? I'm just gonna go right on creating 'cause it comes from here - you know?
I wonder what his deal is.
Man that's a trippy name, kinda like the Warhol mayhem series...
I saw a statue once called The Third Time Phyllis Saw Me She Exploded.
Now what kind of statue was that?
There's that weird dude again.
Man look at that get up !
Looks like that cat paid off in spades.
Man if you want to be a legit artist you have to do nudes, nudes, nudes...
Man this is heavy!
What did he say?
Didn't you hear him?
Man, why do you suppose Walter wants to get her alone? You suppose he could be physically attracted to her?
No man, he ain't the type. He don't get enough vitamin E.
That's alright, we got a pressing engagement!
Walter, what are you doing?
I was just looking at Carla's picture.
Well that's not what I pay you for, now is it?
Well I was uh, just looking...
Well I brought something, I wanted to show you.
What is it, your laundry?
Where'd ya buy that?
You...made that?
Dead Cat!
Dead Cat?
Yeah.
You want to buy it, put it in the club?
Well...why did you put a knife in it?
I didn't mean to.
Alright, I'll tell you what. I'll put it in the corner of the alcove. If it sells, we'll split it fifty- fifty. How's that?
All that is comes through the eye of the artist...
Alright get a grip on yourself Now since you're here why don't you start early, the kitchen needs cleaning.
People seem to like my cat.
Did you hear that Mr. De Santis? Everyone's really crazy about Dead Cat.
Yes they are, aren't they? Look, why don't you take the rest of the night off, you look tired.
No, it's Ok...you came in early. Besides, you're creating an incident. When people are applauding they don't order anything.
Well...
Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.
I don't have another cat!
Well make a dog, make a parakeet! I'm sure you'll think of something.
Go home.
OK...good night Mr. De Santis!
H-have a seat?
I thought I'm not supposed to sit with the customers...
Now why shouldn't you, Walter? Things are different now...
Hiya Carla.
You know what that proves?
The question is what are you going to make next, Walter? Did you make that dog yet, or that parakeet? How about making something out of the cockroaches in your room?
Well...why murdered man?
I don't know, it just happened, I guess. I didn't mean to.
You didn't mean to what?
It's hot in here...
A show?! Like this Sunday?
A show..how soon can we go?
You better hold off on the bubbly.
Yeah, why?
You might talk too much.
Hello Leonard! Beautiful morning, isn't it?
What do you have in the box?
Whatsamatter Leonard?
Whatsamatter Leonard?
Walter...Walter listen carefully. I don't want you to make any more statues. Do you understand? No more statues.
Well Why not? I gotta make statues Leonard. You heard Maxwell, they want me to make them. I can't go back to being a busboy!
Maxwell! He's behind all this with all his stupid blowhard poetry! Listen, you've got to stop right away! I'm beginning to feel responsible!
Well, w-what did you do?
When Carla comes by I'll talk to her. She'll make up some nice invitations. We'll have them printed up.
Yeah?
I tried to contact you by phone but I couldn't...
I want that cat. I'll pay you one thousand dollars - cash.
I'm trying to reach Lieutenant Beldere...
What offers have you got for it? I won't be out-bidded. I'm a wealthy man and I don't mind paying for something I want.
I can't talk right now.
What do you want for it? Two thousand? Three thousand?
No...look I'm busy...
Listen to me...I don't want to lose this piece -
I'm holding for Lieutenant Beldere!
Listen to me, listen to me...I've been collecting art pieces all over the world for years and let me tell you something. This newcomer Walter Paisley has it, whatever it is, the X factor, that indefinable quality that separates the greats from the hacks, and I want that cat in my hands. Are you listening to me?
How ya doin'?
Hello, Walter.
Hi. I know you! I've seen you down at the Jabberjaw plenty.
Yes, you have. Can I come in?
I was going to make some pancakes, you can have some if you like.
Hm.
Did you see my cat?
I also saw the girl give you this.
You like chasing the dragon, Walter?
Chasing the dragon? Whaddya mean? You sure you don't want a pancake?
Police officer.
You're like an undercover guy!
You're in some deep shit pal, whether you know it or not.
Huh?!!!
But I got a feeling you're gonna cooperate with me. Yessir, I think you and me are gonna be real good friends. Why don't you tell me about your connection.
C-connection?
I'm not looking to pinch you! I don't care about you, or the girl. But you want to save your ass, you better start telling me what I want to hear. Now!
Telling you what?
Who's the head honcho! Who's providing the smack connection!
Smack?
Goddammit, where are you from, Mars?
Alaska! What the heck's wrong with it!
Haven't you ever heard of smack! Horse! Junk! Heroin!
Is that what that is? I never seen any before. I always thought that stuff was expensive!
Who do think you're dealing with, huh? I'm willing to cut you a break, chief!
You are?
I- don't know what you're talking about!
You're coming downtown with me, Walter. You're gonna come clean with me, you're gonna name names or I swear to God I'll see to it personally you rot in a cell upstate! Are we understanding each other?
Wait a minute! What'd I do?
I got you cold, pal. Make it easy for yourself, use your head.
I didn't do nothing wrong! That was Mayolia's! I didn't ask her for it. I don't know about any -
Yeah yeah yeah - look! I've heard this song and dance before, save your breath, you're coming with me! Lou goes to turn Walter against the wall but Walter springs back -
Wait a minute - I told you I didn't do nothing wrong!
Don't give me a hard time Walter! You don't want to get me mad! You're coming with me!
You're gonna shoot me!
What are ya, deaf? Turn around!
NO! NO DON'T SHOOT ME I DON'T WANT TO GET SHOT!
YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME!
Walter shut up and relax!
I don't think anyone gets what I said, their blank faces staring, mute, unfeeling -
I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
Well I'm overjoyed.
I thought you believed that life is a homeless traveler riding on the RTD of -
I know that - I know that! I also believe in burning the creative candle, you understand, down to the end - to be uncreative you might as well be dead...a walking machine, toiling in a factory!
Are you done with these?
I saw your...cat.
Did you like it Mister Brock?
Maxwell.
And what project looms on the horizon, Walter?
Hi.
Wheat germ omelette, guava nectar and garbanzo sprinkled with smoked yeast. Join us?
No thanks. Sounds good though.
An' everyone will say Walter let me shake your hand...it's a real pleasure to have known you...
After that we go no more!
I won't say good luck, Walter.
Why not?
Why on Earth should you be so depressed? Have you heard some of the things they've been saying? You can make fifty thousand on these pieces alone!
I thought you didn't respect money!
I get it Walter. I get it.
What do you get?
Hello Mayolia.
Walter, you did something to me with your work tonight.
With Dead Cat. Like a breath of fresh air. I could just - babble on about it for hours.
It's like...you've turned on.
T-turned on?
A hot light bulb is burning inside of you. I want to be warmed by it.
That's really nice of you Mayolia.
Let me into your world Walter... let me into that white hot inspired world.
Well, I'll go home with you.
I don't think so Mayolia.
I want to be part of it, I want to inspire you, I want to do - something!
You don't have to do anything!
I want you to have it. There's a little something for you in here...
Gee. Thanks.
Oh, hello Mrs. Swicker.
Hello Walter. I want to tell you the super fixed the leaky pipes and sealed up that hole in your wall.
Oh, OK.
Walter you look awful pale! What did you have to eat today?
I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swicker.
If you were my son...why don't you let me fix you a nice hot bowl of soup, it won't take but a minute.
Uh, no, I didn't see him at all.
What's got into that cat? Well if you do see him, tell him I've got a nice fat piece of ocean-fresh halibut for him -
T-tell him that?
If you see him.
Good night Walter...
What's all the noise in here!
Don't tell me I didn't hear a racket! I'm an older woman and I don't need to be upset and disturbed in this manner!
I was just straightening up the place.
Straightening up indeed! Are you sure you're not alone?
Walter have you been talking to yourself again?
She doesn't have to be pretty... just as long as she takes good care of you...
Uh, Mrs. Swicker I got to meet some friends later, and I have to take a shower!
I will - good night Mrs. Swicker!
I don't think this is gold.
What's wrong with you!?!
My arm! He took my fucking arm!
You reckless imbecile. This place is ours for the taking and you let yourself... twelve hundred years old and you act like a child.
I had him in my grasp.
I look horrible.
The other two -- the new ones. Where are they?
I don't know. But the boy, he couldn't kill them.
I like it. Can I be your friend?
Well, um... litter?
... And they're having some memorial service or something tomorrow. You going?
I don't know. Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
Whoa! Whoa! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't actually need any right now.
Nice to feel needed.
Let's move out!
Nice game.
Jeffrey, I don't mean to sound sexist or anything, but can I borrow her?
Man has a complex.
Don't grab me, okay?
Buffy! Looking tasty.
Buffy, this is crazy. What do these guys want?
Booo!
Suck!
No, we didn't.
Come on, come on, fork up the scub.
That's it, man. That's the whole story.
It's coffee.
Figures.
You're the guys from the movie!
Hey! She wasted my dog!
Rich bitches. They're a plague. They've gotta be stopped.
You didn't like them.
They're all the same! They're so stuck up, they're just... they're not even human. I hate them.
Would you sleep with them?
Yes. Definitely. Definitely. Please, God.
Well, there it is, isn't it? You don't even like them, and you'd sleep with them. What's that all about?
I got a news flash, man, another shot of this and I'll have sex with you.
When you get your car together, man, let's bail.
You think? Split?
Utterly. Let's bail this town. It's getting... I don't know. Let's go somewhere where there aren't any rich bitches.
Benny, man, where you been? You bailed on me, I passed out, man, I almost did a Jimi Hendrix!
Let me in.
Invite me in, Pike.
Wait a minute. What's wrong with you, man?
I'm fine.
I... feel.... pretty.
No offense, man, but I think you're on something nasty. Why don't you just go and cool out and I'll see you in the morning or something.
Let me in, Pike! I'm hungry!
Get away from here.
I'm hungry.
Did you see a girl come by here?
You don't mean, like, a cheerleader?
Yes.
Yeah, I saw her. Bitch took my wheels.
Wheels?
My bike! She's a lesbian, too. She told me.
Which way did she go?
Excellent.
Your parents are always going away for the weekend. You're so lucky.
Yeah, I guess.
Oh, my God. Is that true?
Are there any good sicknesses that aren't too depressing?
Hey, I was thinking, for the dance, what about a big sign that says 'Don't Tread On Me'. You know, and a picture of the earth.
Dying.
Hi, Buffy.
He doesn't look fifty.
Do you know what time it is?
Buffy, honey?
Yeah?
Have you gained a few pounds? Maybe it's that outfit...
Maybe.
What's Bobby gonna say?
I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.
You okay?
Well... it's possible they think my name's Bobby.
Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh.
Something like that.
What show is this?
It's the news, Buffy.
Oh. Who's in it? I know what it is. It's what's on instead of the movie.
I just want to see the basketball scores. It's important.
Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, wow.
What'd you dream about?
Nothing.
Come on, what was it?
Hey there.
Are you going out with Jeffrey tonight?
Hey, baby, how ya doing? You look beat.
I do? I guess I do.
Where were you last night? I called your house like four times.
I can't get sick. You know -- training and all. I'm gonna be late.
I can take care of myself, Jeffrey.
So that's your tutor, huh? What is he, like, your boyfriend now?
Buffy, what are you doing here?
I thought we were meeting here.
I don't understand.
Oh, come on, Buffy. You know what's going on. It's not working out at all. I've got to move on. I mean, I've got needs, too. I told you about all this.
No, you didn't. When?
Didn't you get my message?
You broke up with my machine?
You weren't home. Like always.
You left me a message?
Ah, my fool is dead. He was careless, always. Still, I'll pull out your tongue for that. Don't you understand? I've killed you a dozen times. Your life is not a blink of my eye, not a single breath. I have lived in the shadows, in the pulsing filth behind men's eyes. A thousand years, and more. I have conversed with the worms that
Have you ever thrown up in the front row of a Richard Marx concert?
You're even weaker than the others.
This? This is you only weapon? Your puny faith?
I am a God! A God!
Will you guys shut up, please?
Can we have a hot dog, please, medium rare, and a cup of joe?
Yeah, we're drunk. We're the Drunks. What's your name?
Hi.
Hi there.
Is that your car?
How are you doing?
Oh, I'm good. I'm good. Kind of miss my knees, though.
You want some water or something?
Do you do this kind of thing a lot? I mean, is this like a hobby?
Not exactly.
They were vampires, weren't they?
Yeah.
You had a car full of stuff. Were you leaving?
Yeah, I was bailing. I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess. Bad scene.
Well, stay here tonight.
Thanks. Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus. I'm gone.
Where are you gonna go?
Hey, jeez are you okay? You need a hand?
Things are kind of confusing.
I'll back that up.
Three weeks ago all I thought about was... well, I didn't actually think about anything. I definitely didn't expect this.
I know. My guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. 'Prison' came up a few times, but nothing about undead.
It's weird. I went back to my old grade school once, to the playground -- I used to hang out there all the time, playing on the swings and stuff... I went back and it was so tiny, the whole place. I couldn't even fit on the swings. Everything just looked so small. I'm sorry. I'm babbling.
I'm kinda beat. You can stay in my mom's room if you want.
I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything.
You sure?
Oh, I'll be fine. Got my chair, got my window, I'm great.
Hey, Buffy...
Yeah?
I didn't expect to see you.
I know.
Why'd you come back?
I don't know. I kind of thought I ought to be here. You know, this isn't exactly the kind of thing you can run away from.
Thanks.
Pike, I don't think you're up to this.
Buffy? What's wrong?
Oh, God. It's him. I think it's him.
Who?
I been working on some stuff for you. What'cha doing?
I'm going shopping. Don't try to stop me.
Cool. I could actually use a couple of Allen wrenches. What do you need?
A dress.
Dress, huh? What for?
For the dance.
Come again?
I'm going to the senior dance.
I'm going to the dance.
What for?
In order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends. Comprende?
I don't believe this. The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?
It's not a mixer. It's the senior dance. And it's important. You wouldn't understand.
You got that right. I thought you wanted to kill vampires.
I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Listen, I know you're bummed about your friend, and I'm really sorry...
He did what he was supposed to.
But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
Right. I'm the chosen one. And I choose to be shopping.
Leave me alone.
I crashed your party.
Pretty shallow of you.
That's me.
I'm glad you came.
Will I get the shit kicked out of me if I ask you to dance?
I'm going out the front.
Are you nuts, Buffy? There's a hundred of them out there. They'll rip us apart.
You're staying here. Some of them might not come after me. If they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain.
Good thing one of us was prepared.
Are you okay?
I didn't say it was a bad idea, I just said the timing was off. We could maybe wait till later.
Don't be such a fraidy-cat.
Who's afraid? Besides me, I mean.
We've come all this way. We just have to check it out. I got a hunch.
It has to be, like a socially conscious theme.
It is a pretty crucial subject.
Bugs.
Can't. History report. The Normans and the Saxons.
Bogutude. Blow it off.
I really can't. Besides, it's pretty interesting.
You're weird and I'm afraid of you. Seriously, Cassandra, there's a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework.
Like what?
Guys, what's the sitch? I'm bored.
) What do you think?
What are we doing?
Why don't we see a movie?
Beverly Center.
Totally stale. And the ushers are like, the acne patrol. We're thinking Pavilion. Sitch?
Excuse much! Not rude or anything.
What did Jeffrey's dad say?
Let's meet tonight, okay?
Where?
I don't see why we have to invite everyone.
I didn't learn... I just... it's not a big deal.
Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National.
You were supposed to be here at three.
I forgot.
Buffy, what is your sitch? You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax-Bracket; it's too weird.
Look, a lot's been going on. That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you. You see... a while ago, I met this guy --
Excuse me for having something important to do.
This isn't important? The earth is our home.
Listen to you. What language are you speaking?
I'm glad you guys are here. It's good to see you.
Yeah, whoops I came.
You look way pretty, Kim.
God, where the hell did you come from? You scared me to death.
What? Oh. I used to do gymnastics. Are you looking for someone?
I'm looking for you, actually.
Am I in trouble or something?
Not at all. My name is Merrick. I was sent to find you some time ago. I should have found you much sooner but there were... complications. You should have been taught, prepared.
What are you talking about?
I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.
Why?
To bring you... your birthright.
I had a trust fund my great- grandfather, or maybe it was an inheritance, 'cause he's dead, and I spent it on shoes.
You must come with me. It's much too late already. You must come with me to the graveyard.
Wait a minute. My birthright is in the graveyard? Later not.
Wait!
You're one of those skanky old men that, like, attack girls and stuff. Forget you. My, um, my boyfriend is gonna be here in about thirty seconds, and he's way testy.
You don't understand. You have been chosen.
Chosen to go to the graveyard? Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?
You must believe me. You must come with me while there's still time.
Time to do what?
To stop the killing. To stop the vampires.
Let me get this straight. You're like, this greasy bum, and I have to go to the graveyard with you 'cause I'm chosen, and there's vampires.
Yes.
Does Elvis talk to you? Tell you to do things? Do you see spots?
Just stay away from me, okay?
Everybody does.
I was a slave.
In Virginia.
I don't know. It was... There was a big gram or something. And there's one, I'm like a prostitute...
China.
I had a dream once where I was... There was like, knights in it, and I worked in this bar. And I... was fighting. I'm always fighting. And there's a guy... He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always... trying to kill me.
How do you know all this?
I can't believe I'm doing this. I can't believe I'm in a graveyard with a strange man hunting for vampires on a school night.
Why didn't you ever tell anybody about your dreams?
Ow.
Cramps?
None of your business. God.
Wait a minute.
Just for protection. You won't have to do anything. I just need you to watch.
All right. What do we do now?
Where's the other one?
Go to school tomorrow. Try to act normal. Don't let anyone know what's happening. This is important. When the vampires find out who you are... you won't be hunting them anymore.
Meet me at this address after school.
I have cheerleading squad.
They can't come in, right? Unless you invite them. Is that true?
It's not pretty, but it does suit our purposes.
What, um... What do we do?
There's a great deal I have to show you, I'm not even sure where to start There's so little time.
Why do you keep saying that?
Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
A Vampire-King? You mean like Dracula?
Oh, yes. And the man from your dreams. Lothos.
Oh, him.
Yes. They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork. The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own. You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated. Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy. But for some reason, nobody
What?
We'll cover it later.
I still don't get how they happened to come to my town. I mean, was I born here because... because they were coming here? That Lothos guy, and his buddies?
In a way, yes. Your fate is inexorably connected to them.
Great. First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate. Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
Not a pressing issue.
I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you. What your strengths are, your likes... Everything. What's your best subject?
Uh... gym.
Yes, you used to do gymnastics. But you stopped. Why?
Well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky. I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs? They're like -- -- the mighty oak. It's not a look.
But you enjoyed it, yes?
Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.
Cheerleading. For... sporting events, yes?
Sporting events, yeah.
All right. Why don't you show me a cheer?
Here?
Yes, yes. It would be interesting. A nice cheer.
Who we gonna beat?
Who we gonna beat?
No -- you don't have to --
Oh. I thought... you lead me --
No. You don't do anything. I do it.
Oh, what the hell is wrong with you? You threw a knife at my head!
I had to test you.
But you threw a knife at my head!
And you caught it! Only the chosen one could have done that.
It was necessary.
Last night. You knew I was sitting on a fresh grave, didn't you?
Oh. Sorry.
Don't you see what's happening? You're changing. You've got powers you've only just begun to tap. Physical, mental prowess you've never dreamed of. God, this hurts. I've administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working. I'm sorry I have to take so many shortcuts in the training process.
Put your head back.
Two days ago, would you have even hit me? Let alone so powerfully?
No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.
Ooh, another embarrassment for the teabag, while the chosen one is still well under par.
What about bats? Do they turn into bats?
No. No bats, no flying. They... float, occasionally. Not really flying.
Toasty. Were there ever any, like, famous vampires?
Oh, several. Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are any of those names familiar?
If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
Good Lord. What do you study in history?
All right. You've heard of the emperor Caligula, perhaps? Or Jack the Ripper?
They were vampires?
Same one.
What!?!
He was slow. Very simple. They won't all be that easy.
Fine.
And the alley was a mistake. Never corner yourself like that. If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now. One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
Nice conversationalist! Yeah, I felt 'em a little, but I ain't due for two weeks since you're so excited about the subject.
It's natural. A reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it. It's part of how you are able to track them.
Oh, wonderful. My secret weapon is - PMS. That's just great. Thanks for telling me.
You'll get used to it. I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
You are such a wet.
A what?
A wet! Didn't I just kill that vampire? I think I did. I didn't see you killing any vampires. You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'.
Don't start with me again.
Aren't I, like the chosen one? The one and only? The Grand High Poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me? Like, ever?
Buffy...
And why are you always wearing black? It's so down. It's totally not your color. I don't think you have a color.
What do you want? Encouragement? 'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'
Do you know how many girls I've trained to be Slayers? Five. Five properly prepared girls, girls who faced their responsibilities, who worked hard to become women overnight -- harder than you've ever worked in your life -- and I saw them ripped apart. Do you want to live? Do you?
I...
Five?
Five.
So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
Not if you're careful.
How can you keep doing this?
It's what I was raised to do. There aren't many of us left, the Watchers.
Watchers?
There's a small village in Hampshire, near Stonehenge... ... near a bunch of big rocks. That's where I was born. My father taught me about the training, about finding the Slayers, reading the signs. There's a small cluster of us, a few families, really... most of the neighboring villagers think we're just a bunch of harmless old loonies. I thought so myself for a
I wish you would.
It isn't important.
I'm curious, is all.
Buffy, don't... don't start thinking of me as your friend. It interferes with the work, and it...
Well, you know, I'm not gonna kick so easy. I've got a few things the other girls didn't have.
As for example, what?
Well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.
Vampires of the world, beware.
I mean, most of the time Jeffrey's really sweet, but sometimes he gets kind of... 'Me-Tarzan'ish, you know what I mean? Lately it bugs me, I guess. Merrick? Are you still breathing?
I can't work this.
We call them zippers. They're not supposed to be a challenge.
But it's in the back. Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
Because you clash, Merrick. You clash with everything. I mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'Slayers trained her.' Honestly, you look like something out of... Pasadena.
My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable.
I want to die.
Interesting.
There isn't time.
Make time, okay? You're the one who told me to act normal. I've missed three practices already. If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
Another distraction. It's not right.
Why because it's not my fate? It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game?
Sooner or later you're going to have to accept it. Your fate.
I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore. Come on, Merrick. Football. Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left.
All right.
Toasty. You should come; it's gonna be a great game.
Oh, I'll be there all right. I'm not letting you out of my sight. Not till you're ready.
Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act like a fan.
Football is my life.
None of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble.
Wait!
Mr. Howard is so heinous. He's always giving me a hard time. I get a C-plus on the test and he tells me, 'You have no sense of history.' I have no sense of history? He wears a brown tie.
You got a C-plus? I can't believe I cheated off you.
No THX.
So, is Jeffrey really spending the night at your house?
That's the plan.
Cool. We can figure decorations and stuff.
Come one, that was so weird.
-- like she's gonna kill me.
I was just scared is all.
That is so cool.
Thank you very much.
I don't get it.
You guys blow. I'm waiting on Cassandra. She's gonna help me with my history.
Cassandra's really smart.
Yeah... She's okay, though.
Don't worry, Jennifer. Someday your prince will come.
Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
Hey, Buffers. You look thrashed.
Thanks.
Buffy, Jesus! You know these steps.
Pike.
Well, I guess you got what you came for.
Nicole...
Hi, guys.
Hi.
I haven't seen him tonight.
I find it restorative, sleeping in the life-blood of so many. To feel their souls coursing about me.
What's happening? What do you want?
So very much.
My parents have money...
What... are you?
No, wait. I can be dumb. Really. Or mean, or whatever. I can learn. I'm useful.
Really?
I can't!
You know you must. There is only one. Now you are that one. It is time.
Why? Why me?
The mark of the Coven.
I don't understand.
But as long as there have been vampire, there has been the Coven; the line of Slayers. Ones with the strength and the skill to kill them, to find them where they gather and stop the swell of their numbers. One dies, the next is called.
I'm just a girl.
Bessel! What are you doing here?
Hi, Grueller.
What are you grinning at? You think I was scared?
Could be.
You think so?
Listen, you little worm. I could beat your head to a pulp for you, just like I did last year, you got that? You got that?
Got that.
Write that down.
Oh, yes! Yes!
Oh, baby!
Buffy?
Well, I'm done. Are you done?
No --
Okay, let's go.
She didn't even hardly talk to anyone in school. All year. She didn't even go to the prom.
I can't believe they still ate it.
So they found Cassandra's body out by the railway tunnels. Nobody's saying anything, but they think she was involved in something, like, illegal or something. Like dealing.
Well, I hope so.
I got all the plastic stuff. What should I do with it?
And Spring Fling.
She was even crazier after that. I mean it, you wouldn't even have recognized her.
Omniplex?
What happened?
Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke.
You're kidding.
Snapped. Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room. Perm over heels.
Oh, my God! Ouch! No wonder you quit.
I never thought of that.
Buffy!
Cool!
The don't. You kind of wish they would, though.
Wit-tay.
I'm sorry. I'm Pike. This is Benny.
Pike isn't a name. It's a fish.
They'll kill us!
Oh, God.
God! Take a chill lozenge.
The homelesses?
Environment. That's cool with me.
Oh, yeah!
If we don't invite all the seniors we can't use the school funds, you know that.
Can't they make exceptions? Maryanne Heinel? She's such a scud. Can't we have a Maryanne clause?
Smell of booze much.
Buffy, the ape-woman.
I really was way way too too.
Oh, please! When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?
What are you talking about?
Oh, thank you very much.
Like you've got a grip.
So, we're stupid now?
You know, just because you're having full-on wiggans doesn't mean you have to drag us into it. This isn't just any dance. It happens ot be the last dance of our last year.
Except for Prom.
And the January Semi-formal --
It's amazing what you can do with a parachute and some starch.
What nasty bug crawled up your bungus and where the hell are you going?
I'm leaving, man. I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy.
Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
No... You want me to give him a message?
Ah, you'll be coming back.
I don't think so.
All right. Take care of yourself.
I am.
Hey. What should I do if I see Benny?
You mean Nuke. You said "Crash".
I didn't say "Crash". I said Nuke.
You said "Crash".
Honey, don't ever listen to a woman when she's making love. They'll say the strangest things.
You said "Crash".
Yeah maybe you're right.
Mmm, hmmm. You shoulda seen how many people came to the airport to see me off. When I got drafted first it was the happiest day of my Father's life. He likes baseball more than I do...
You can learn to like it.
I wanted to be the host of Dance Fever, somethin' like that...
Y'know if you make it to the Bigs you could still become the host of Dance Fever. Baseball's a good stepping stone for things like that.
God, I never thought of that.
I want you to wear these on the road trip when you pitch.
What?
They'll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that you'll start seeing things differently--plus they'll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters.
Jesus, Annie, I don't know--
You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain. These'll help move things to the right side.
Big League pitchers don't use these.
God I'm tired. What a trip I was lousy. I was worse than lousy. Everytime I pitched--it was like throwing gasoline on a fire. Kaboom. I--
What is this "I, I, I" stuff? You only talk about yourself? Aren't you glad to see me? Don't I look nice?
Sorry. You look great. I'm totally exhausted.
Good. Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous. Let's play catch.
This in ridiculous. I'm a pro.
Just do what I say. Now, which nostril are you breathing through?
The right nostril. Good.
My right nostril?
The ida originates at the right testicle and terminates at the left nostril.
I'm really beat. I need some serious "z's"--
The pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball. And if you discover before a game you're in the wrong nostril, it's easy to switch.
Switch nostrils?
You're patronizing me! I will not be patronized--
If I throw too hard I'll hurt the kid.
How was that?
A little better.
How ya like that?
I can't keep up with you. First you say sex is gonna make me a better pitcher--now no sex is gonna do it?!
God...I think I'm gonna be sick--
Death is like spring training?
I'm yours.
Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games.
Breathing through your pingala always works, honey--
Not that. I mean the re-channeling of my sexual energy. Maybe we shouldn't make love for awhile.
You know what it feels like to throw a three hitter? We better not fuck.
Nuke?!
Just till I lose.
Get over here.
No.
I'm so proud of you and all the guys. Want some more soup?
No, no, it was great.
How 'bout a back rub?
No, that's okay. All I need's a little nap.
I'll tuck you in.
You can't seduce me.
That's my leg.
I know what it is.
Fundamentals?
Crash once called a woman's, uh-- pussy--y'know how the hair kinda makes a "V" shape?--
Yes I do...
Well--he calls it the Bermuda Triangle. He said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again.
What a nasty thing to say.
He didn't mean it nasty. He said that gettin' lost and disappearing from the face of the earth was sometimes a good thing to do-- especially like that.
No! You're playing with my mind!
I'm trying to play with your body!
I knew it--you're seducing me!
Of course I'm seducing you for Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn poor job of it-- Aren't I pretty?
I think you're real cute.
Cute?! I hate cute! Baby ducks are cute! I wanta be exotic and mysterious!
Nuke! You got things all wrong! There's no relation between sex and baseball. Ask Crash.
I did.
What'd he say?
He said if I gave in to you I'd start losing again.
He did?
We lost.
I'd like you to meet my father.
I couldn't dump my old man but maybe later I can sneak away from him...
You don't have to...
I'm starting to understand what you're teaching me. I mean the panties and the nostrils and all that shit...I mean I'm getting it--
Aw hell, let's have a quickie right here--
--but you're father's in there!
It's Skip, for you.
I gotta leave first thing in the morning.
That's great!
Well I guess this is it.
Neither will I.
I think I'm ready for the Show.
Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh--don't think too much.
--Millie, you've got to stay out of the clubhouse. It'll just get everybody in trouble.
I got lured.
You didn't get "lured". Women never get lured. They're too strong and powerful for that. Now say it--"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
Well let's get down to it, honey-- how was he?
Omigawd, honey, I'm so happy for you.
You should be at the game.
Five hours. We both just know. Do you think I deserve to wear white?
I'm Crash Davis.
Annie Savoy. Wanta dance?
I don't dance.
She's dancing with me.
Crash, I didn't think you--
These are the ground rules. I hook up with one guy a season-- I mean it takes me a couple of weeks to pick the guy--kinda my own spring training... And, well, you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far. So... I thought we should get to know each other.
Why do you get to choose? Why don't I get to choose?
After 12 years in the minor leagues, I don't tryout. Besides-- I don't believe in, Quantum Physics when it comes to matters of the heart...or loins.
I believe in the soul, the cock, the pussy, the small of a woman's back, the hanging curve ball, high fiber, good scotch, long foreplay, show tunes, and that the novels of Thomas Pynchon are self-indulgent, overrated crap. I believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, I believe that there oughtta be a constitutional amendment outlawing astro-turf and the designated hitter, I believe in
Oh my... Don't leave...
Wait, Crash--don't go--all I want is a date. I'm not gonna fall in love with you or nothin'.
I'm not interested in a woman who's interested in that boy.
See my hips?
Yep.
I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.
When you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting. But you shouldn't think about it too much. The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.
But you were pulling your hips last night.
I'm committed to Nuke for the season. You had your chance the other night.
What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy. a young, wild,
Young men are uncomplicated. And he's not "dim". He's just inexperienced. My job is to give him "life-wisdom" and help him make it to the major leagues.
Damn.
You're pulling your hips out.
Don't tell anybody.
Why not? If you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ! The record's
247 home runs in the minors would be a dubious honor, if ya think about it.
Oh no, I think it'd be great! The Sporting News should know about it.
Damn.
Your place or mine?
Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao-Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous.
Well, Annie, your place or mine?
You got me all confused.
A batter has two tenths of a second to decide whether to swing--
Crash...I want you.
Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh?
He' s confused--
Aren't we all?
You're gorgeous, God damn it! From the moment I first saw you I knew I had to have you. I had to have you!
I want to be had.
I think of you and the "boy" all the time.
He won't make love to me anymore.
And he's right! A ballplayer on a streak has to respect the streak. They don't happen very often. You know how hard this game is? If you believe you're playing well because you're getting laid or because you're not getting laid or because you wore red silk panties--then you are! And I still think Thomas Pynchon is full of shit.
Who are you? Do you have a job?
I teach part time at the Junior College. What if I told you I was through with Nuke? He learned his lessons quickly and left me.
And now you wanta teach me?
I don't imagine there's much I could teach you.
I doubt that.
Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?
I'm ready for a complicated man.
--and as soon as we lose a game, he'll be back in your arms.
I said when I think about you, I get wet.
God damn you--what is happening? Is there no man who'll have me? This is the weirdest season I ever saw--the Durham Bulls can't lose and I can't get laid!
Why baseball?
I crossed the street--it was the New York Yankees spring training field--tok, tok, tok, was the sound of a ball hitting a bat-- and I sat in the warm bleachers to think about my mother... And I saw him.
Who?
Thurman Munson. He was covered with dirt and he was fighting with everybody--it was beautiful ... And he called the ump a cocksucker and got thrown out of the game even though it was an exhibition! So I stayed in the bleachers all spring and gradually came to understand what's so great about baseball.
What's so great about baseball?
I don't know if I'd go that far.
It's true, It's true! Least it used to be true. It ain't possible that baseball's not enough anymore, is it, Crash?
It's possible.
No.
Are you gonna be waking up next to 20 year old ballplayers when you're 60?
Well...I used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to. Lately I'm not so sure.
Why not?
I got released.
... so you see in a former lifetime I'm sure that I was Alexandria, the Czarette of Russia? What do you think?
How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous? How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo?
What happened?
I'm quitting too. Boys, not baseball.
There might be an opening for a manager at Salem next spring.
Salem, Massachusetts? Where all the witches were?
Yeah...you a witch?
You think I could make it to the Show as a manager?
You'd be great, just great... 'Cause you understand non-linear thinking even though it seems like baseball is a linear game 'cause of the lines and the box scores an' all--but the fact is that there's a spacious-"non-time kind of time" to it...
Annie---
What?
I got a lotta time to hear your theories and I wanta hear every damn one of 'em...but right now I'm tired and I don't wanta think about baseball and I don't wanta think about Quantum Physics... I don't wanta think about nothing... I just wanta be.
Number twenty-two's thighs are just great. Who's he?
Jose Galindo. He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.
Ninety-five miles an hour.
Take this to Ebby in the dugout between innings.
What's it say?
Oh dear....easy honey...
Hum, babe, hum, babe, fire it in here, hum babe--
Ninety-three miles an hour.
Oh no--he's shaking off the sign, Jackson. Big mistake...
Ebby's told me a lot about you.
He's a good student.
We were worried that Ebby might get involved with the wrong crowd in professional baseball--we're so pleased, he met a Christian woman.
Let's have a quick word of prayer, right here, to thank the Lord for all this--
God bless you.
Thanks for the note--you're right, I wasn't bending my back.
Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.
You need a nickname.
Well--you boys stopped fighting yet? Are you pals now? Good. I love a little macho male bonding-- I think it's sweet even if it's probably latent homosexuality being "re-channeled" but I believe in "re-channeling" so who cares, right? Shall we go to my place?
Which one of us?
Is somebody gonna go to bed with somebody or what?
No ballplayer ever said "no" to a date with me.
No, no, no. Put it back on and take it off slowly.
Jesus, what kinda broad are you?
No, no, honey... first the shoes and socks.
The socks? It's cold in here.
Sweetie, have you ever heard of Walt Whitman?
Who's he play for?
Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars.
Good--then listen. "I sing the body electric. The armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth them--"
We gonna fuck or what?
What's that?
Chicken bone cross take the curse off this bat and bring me hits.
You a God damn witch?
Yes. A switch hitting witch. Very common in Puerto Rico.
Will that work for me?
If you believe in Voodoo.
No, that is not belief. That is desperation.
I got him on the knee!
You missed him!
Don't bump me.
It was a cocksucking call!
Did you call me a cocksucker?
No! I said It was a cock-sucking call and you can't run me for that!
You missed the tag!
You spit on me!
I didn't spit on you!
You're in the wrong business, Jack--you're Sears-Roebuck material!
You're close, Crash, you want me to run you? I'll run you!
You want me to call you a cocksucker?!
Try it! Go ahead. Call me a cocksucker!
Beg me!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
Beg me again!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
You're a cocksucker!
Hey! What're you guys doing here-- stealing my girl?
Drive off your back leg. You pitch with your legs as much as your arms-
I thought I was--
Fun? What's he know about fun? Why's he calling for a curveball? I wanta bring heat.
Why you shaking me off?
I wanta throw the heater to announce my presence with authority.
"To announce your fucking presence with authority"? This guy's a first ball fastball hitter. He's looking for heat.
But he ain't seen my heat--
Fastball.
Guy hit the shit outta that one, eh?
Well, I held it like an egg.
An' he scrambled the son of a bitch. Having fun yet?
I'm having a blast. God, that sucker teed off on it just like he knew I was gonna throw a fastball.
He did know.
How?
Oh she may get wooly, women do get wooly, because of all the stress...
How come you don't like me?
'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem. You got a gift.
What do I got?
You got a Hall of Fame arm but you're pissing it away.
I ain't pissing nothing away--I got a Porsche already. A 944 with A.C. and a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.
You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt--you need a curve ball. In the Show, everybody can hit the fastball.
You been in the Majors?
You could be one of those guys-- but you don't give a fuck, Meat.
This is from Tony for the rainout. C'mon, man, let's go to the party.
Naw...
"Naw"? There's ice skaters coming! You ever made love to an ice skater?
By the dozen. Holiday on Ice, Ice Capades, Ice Follies-- I'm through with one night stands.
You're through with one night stands?! What do you want?
You're weird, man--I want a ice skater real bad.
Go for it.
If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?
Party without me.
Can I ask you something?
What?
What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?
I was playing naked.
Annie says her panties will keep one side of my brain occupied while I'm on the mound, thus keeping my brain slightly off center, which is where it should be for artists and pitchers. She also said I should throw whatever pitches you call for.
I was great, eh?
Your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging--in the Show they woulda ripped you.
Can't you let me enjoy the moment?
Hey, I'm cruisin', man--what're you doing out here?!
I want you to throw this one at the bat rack.
Why?! I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.
It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters. Trust me.
You told him I was throwing a deuce, right?
I love winning, Crash, you hear me? I love It. Teach me everything.
It's time you started working on your interviews.
What do I gotta do?
Write this down. "We gotta play 'em one day at a time."
Boring.
Of course. That's the point. "I'm just happy to be here and hope I can help the ballclub."
Jesus.
"...Good Lord willing, things'll work out."
She's getting steamed 'cause I'm still re-channeling my sexual energy--maybe I should cave in and sleep with her once just to calm her down. What'ya think?
What's wrong?
Anybody says anything bad about Millie, I'll break his neck.
Club's expanding its roster to finish the season--
I'm going to the Show.
I'm trying to thank you.
Settle what?
C ' mon!
I don't wanta fight you, I wanta thank you. Let's have a drink and forget this--
C'mon, we got nothin' to fight about.
You fuck!
Why am I a fuck?
Why are you a fuck? 'Cause you got talent. I got brains. But you got talent! You're God damn left arm is worth a million dollars a year. All my limbs put together are worth 7 cents a pound--and that's for science and dog meat.
You're a great catcher.
Come over here into the light so I can kick your ass.
No.
I'll take you back to the hotel.
Nuke...tell me something. Did you hit me with your right or your left?
Good. Good. That's terrific...
What?
Sorry about last night.
Forget it.
I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon. D'you understand that?
No.
You will. Look, Nuke--these Big League hitters are gonna light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile-- don't worry about it. Be cocky and arrogant even when you're getting beat. That's the secret. You gotta play this game with fear and arrogance.
Fear and ignorance.
No. Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, not ignorance!
Well, I got Annie all warmed up for ya... She's just waiting for you to show up, y'know...
I don't need a crazy woman in my life.
It's the best, Nuke...the absolute fucking best.
Nuke-- Good luck.
Crash Davis?
I'm too old for this shit. Why the hell am I back in "A" ball?
We want you to room with him on the road and stay on his case all year. He can go all the way.
And where can I go?
I don't know. I haven't caught anything yet.
Yeah, Skip, you wanted to see me?
Step outside, pal.
I don't believe in fighting.
Pussy.
Take the first shot at me.
I ain't hitting a man first.
I'd kill ya.
From what I hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot
Don't try me.
Throw it. C'mon, right in the chest.
No way.
We fight, she gets the clown-- how's that happen?
Shut up--I like this song... April in Paris, this is a feeling, No one can ever reprieve...
She's playing with my mind.
Who you calling a "boy"?
I gotta go now, Dad.
I was thinking I could fly up and spend a week in the Big Leagues with you--help you get comfortable.
No. If I screw up, I wanta do it alone. I'll call.
We'll be praying for you.
Dad--if my curveball is hanging, God ain't gonna help me.
We'll pray anyway.
Hi, Jimmy. Want a ride?
Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?
No.
Can I give you my testimony?
Well tell 'em, honey.
Where's Ebby?
Ain't he warning up?
No. The guy's professional debut and he forgets about it.
Little high.
He walked eighteen?!
It's a league record.
Struck out eighteen...
Ohyeah. I shoulda throwed a slider. Damn, Crash, how're ya?
He's got a million dollar arm and a five cent head.
--we had the gun on him tonight-- the last five pitches he threw were faster than the first five. 96 miles an hour, 98, 97, 97. 97. He's got the best young arm I've seen in 30 years.
But he ain't quite sure which plane he's on, y'know what I mean...
Sears sucks, Crash, I tried it once. Sold Lady Kenmores--it's nasty, nasty work.
You guys lollygag the ball around the infield, ya lollygag you're- way to first, ya lollygag in an' outta the dugout. You know what that makes ya Lollygaggers. What's our record, Larry?
We're eight and sixteen.
Eight and twenty-four.
Eight and twenty-four! How'd we ever win 8 games?
It's a miracle.
Patkin was a tribute to baseball...
Jesus--what's got into Nuke?
I heard he's wearing women's underwear--and he's breathing through his pingala nostril.
Nuke's overthrowing tonight, he don't look loose. Anything bothering him?
He said his chakras were jammed and he was breathing out of the wrong nostril.
What the hell's going on out there?
It's a damn convention.
The organization wants to make a change...now that Nuke's gone they wanta bring up some young catcher...
Some kid hittin' .300 in Lynchburg ...probably a bust.
What'you want, kid?
Jim looking for somebody.
Who ain't?
Looking for Crash Davis.
Ain't here.
I'm Nuke LaLoosh. With the Bulls.
Crash ain't there. He never gets back till four or five--
Where does he go?
Well, I'd rather not say.
Goddamn, that's great! Jesus! Listen, Crash don't like anybody to know it but-- Most nights he goes down to, you know, down to Niggertown. To Sandy's... the whorehouse.
He goes to a whorehouse every night?
Thank you.
I mean, the guy is history as far as I'm concerned. History.
But you can't just fire him. Webb's his brother-in-law. He's County Commissioner.
So what? Everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of it.
This is his state. His uncle's Chief Judge. His brother-in-law runs the County Commission. I don't know how many other relatives he's got in town. There's gotta be a way to work him back in.
Look at yours.
What?
Look at that. Look at this. There's nothin'... look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has. Yours is falling apart. I have nothing.
What are you talking about?
...was gonna stop what came up next at the casino.
It turned out Phil Green, Mr Integrity, had a partner nobody knew about... and when she showed up and started demanding some money from the Tangiers...
I'm a little in shock, quite frankly...
Hi, Ace.
Hey, I need a room. Need a room.
I was never - I was never your guest at the Tangiers.
You were never my guest?!
That's right.
I never comped you?! I don't comp you at least two or three times a month at the Tangiers?!
Uh, I - I'd... I'd like to answer - answer that at this time.
Liar.
Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
The only time I was at the Tangiers was when I had dinner with Barney Greenstein.
Was I at that dinner? Just tell me -
You were wandering around.
Was I at that dinner?
You were wandering around.
Was I at that dinner?
You were wandering around.
Was I at that dinner?
You were in the m- You were in the building.
You know damn well I was at that dinner, and you swore to me that I would have a fair hearing at that dinner! Did you not?! Did you not?! Well, tell me I was at least at the dinner! A-allow me that much. Give me that much at least!
As far as the world was concerned Andy Stone, the head of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, was a legitimate guy.
This is a very auspicious occasion.
A powerful man.
He even played golf with the President.
On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to you . . .
But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green...
You don't have to have a license to work in a casino. All you gotta do is apply for one. The state law says you can work in a casino while they're processing your application. They got a ten-year backlog.
But what happens when they do find out?
Why would they want to find out? We're puttin' a hundred million into this desert here. Why would they want to lock us out? And besides, they'll never find out. All you gotta do is keep changing your job title. Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman. And what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the bottom
It's a tough proposition, Andy. You, you know, if I did it, I'd have to run it my way.
You got it.
I'm serious. No interference.
He's on all night, screamin' about how he's gonna take his damn lawsuit all the way to the Supreme Court. He really must be crazy. He's gonna go to Washington with this? He's out of his fuckin' mind.
First of all, what they did was totally unconstitutional. We're already on the list to be heard before the Supreme Court of the United States later this year.
These guys back home don't give a fuck about the Supreme Court and any of this bullshit! They want things to quiet down. They want you to walk away from -
Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious. How can I walk away? Don't you see what's goin' on here? Don't you see what's at stake?
The old man said, 'Maybe your friend should give in.' And when the old man says 'maybe', that's like a papal bull. Not only should you quit, you should run!
Know what my problem is? Every time they mention my name in the papers, these cocksuckers, they mention Nicky, too. How the fuck does that help? I mean, the heat he brought down is murder! We had a police department who was cooperative. He's pissed them off so much now that nobody can make a move anymore. I mean, what do you do about
What do you propose?
I don't know, he doesn't listen to me. Maybe he should... get lost for a while. Take a vacation. Would that be so bad?
They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere.
All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying.
I would forget about the maneuver. I would just get out.
Even after a little vacation, they hassled him at the airport.
Excuse me.
...stupid things.
Watch it, partner, watch it!
...been right, but who knows?
No, you're not calm.
Yeah, I don't want her in there more than a few more minutes.
No, it's - it'll just be a couple of minutes. We got other things to do too, you know. He'll hurry her up. How's everything else besides this?
Fine, fine. How's your family?
Not bad, not bad. In fact, uh, my wife's pregnant again.
Oh, good.
Yeah.
Okay, Randy. Thank you.
Stop -
Wait, hold on a second.
Hey!
Look, look. You can't stop her for speeding? I mean, look what the hell she's doing.
But one thing I could never understand, was that she could have everything under control, except for her old pimp boyfriend, Lester Diamond.
Yeah.
She's my wife. Look at me. You did know that, didn't you? You knew that she's my wife? Huh? Hey, look at me.
Yeah, yeah. I know that.
Okay.
You fuckin' piece of shit.
M- Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein?
Hello.
Hello.
Yeah, is this Lester? This is Sam...
...Rothstein. I want to talk to Ginger. Put her on the phone.
She's not here, Sam.
Lester...
...listen to me very carefully. I want to talk to Ginger. I want my kid back. I want her put on a plane immediately.
I know she's there. Don't fuck around with me.
You understand? Put her on the fuckin' phone.
Sam, I - I don't know where she is, okay?
So, l-l-l-listen, I te- I te- I tell you - can I call you back in a few minutes?
702 472 1862.
Mm-hm. 1862. Okay, good. I'll call you right b-
Right away.
I'll call you right back.
Right back.
Now this is just a signature card.
So, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box? No one else, including myself?
Sam, let me ask you a question. You must really trust your wife.
Yeah, sure I do. Why?
No, tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.
Oh. Have a good day at school.
Hello? Hello! Ginger.
Amy! Amy, open the door!
I can't! I'm tied!
Dad!
What happened? What happened? Who did this to you?
Mommy.
I'm gonna get a knife and cut you loose, honey, I'll -
When did this happen, honey?
You don't know? What time did your mother do this? When did she leave?
I don't know.
...by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars. I don't know all the details.
But it's in the desert where lots of the town's problems are solved.
...give him a shot at runnin' a casino and he tries to talk you out of it.
You know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that.
Where the hell did you learn how to deal?
He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
I'll take Columbia for twenty.
Yeah, we made a great pair. I made book and Nicky made sure we always collected. The old men loved us. And why not? They all made money with us.
They payin'?
It was eight. Ace... tell him the line on the Bear's game.
Eight.
What's that? You hear? You hear a little girl, Frankie? You hear a little girl, Ace? Is that a little fuckin' girl?! What happened to the fuckin' tough guy? Told my friend stick it up his fuckin' ass?! Huh?! Huh?!
While I was tryin' to figure out why the guy was sayin' what he was sayin', Nicky just hit him. No matter how big a guy might be, Nicky would take him on. You beat Nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat. You beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun. And you beat him with a gun, you
But nobody had to take care of Nicky.
You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.
...nobody interfered with the fuckin' skim.
Okay, Sammy.
Somethin', huh?
Yeah.
Holy shit, what've you been doin' out here?
After we ate, we left Jennifer and Ginger alone and we took a ride to talk. And then... he hit me with it.
What do you think about me movin' out here? What's the matter? You got a problem with that?
No, of course not.
You mean, I have your permission?
Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.
I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there. Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home.
Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit.
But I saw it another. I saw it as untouched. I mean, they had bookies, pimps and drug dealers I could shake down. Who the fuck were they gonna run to? So, I started getting everybody in line. Best of all, for the first time in my life, I figured out a way not to lose.
Ohh!
Especially at the casino, where he definitely did not work, people got the message.
When I married Ginger I knew all the stories, but I didn't give a fuck. 'I'm Sam Rothstein,' I said. 'I can change her.'
...Nicky was dreamin' his own kind of Vegas.
...the next thing I did, I started bustin' out high-stakes poker players.
And I didn't want any of those agents near my place.
I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that.
Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
No, I didn't know that. But you know what he did?
He insulted Billy. And then I walked over to him politely...
...and he tells me to go fuck myself.
What?
Then he called me a faggot.
So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out.
If he does it again, he's out for good. I don't care what it is, Nick, I'm gonna ha- I'll - I'll never let him in the place again.
I'm sorry about this. Really.
All right, Ace?
Okay.
But I'll tell you, he knew how to bring in the crowds. He knew all the fuckin' angles. He brought over the whole 'Femme Fatale' show from Paris. But he forgot how lazy them European dancin' broads can get. I mean, he had to weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they didn't blow up like fuckin' balloons.
Hey, I gotta give the guy credit. He does the most obvious thing. This is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit, so, why not take advantage, right? So... he took bookie joints off the street and then opened them up inside the casino. Well, within a few years, by doin' all of this, he had every casino on
You better watch yourself. There's a lot of heat on you already.
Why, somebody's complaining?
I'm - I'm hearin' things from security. They're all ex-cops. The Sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls. They want to put you in the Black Book.
That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit. They got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still Al Capone.
Bullshit or no bullshit, they put you in that book, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. You will not be able to walk into the casino. I'm tellin' you.
What am I doin' out here? I'm tryin' to make a livin', that's all.
I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you.
Well, it wasn't long before what I was afraid was gonna happen, happened. Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas, and from then on, I couldn't be seen talkin' to him anywhere in Vegas, or even near it.
' ...detrimental to gaming. And he will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas... and the casinos can be fined as much as a hundred thousand every time he shows up.' Do you believe this shit?
Motherfucker. Unsavory fuckin'... Is there any way around this?
Nope, there's no way.
Let's say... for instance... I want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like?
Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot. That's how serious it is.
In other words, I'm fucked.
In so many words, yes.
It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care.
Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants. He was a real restaurant buff. And over the years, he always made money with them.
- no matter where he was or what he was doing, he always went home to make breakfast for his son, Nicky- Boy.
Hello.
No, no it's okay.
It's impossible. It's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation. It's...
...very difficult to get in.
Hey, Ace.
You think he got the point?
What're you doin'? He's a square guy, for chrissakes. You can't treat him like that. He's gonna run to the FBI.
Fuck the FBI! That prick's been dodging me for three weeks. And what is it with you? All of a sudden, you're tryin' to tell me what to do all the time.
I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doin'? Where's your head?
Where's my head? Where's your fuckin' balls? Huh? You know I'm tryin' to put somethin' really big together out here. You know what I'm talkin' about, huh? You know! If you're actin' like this now, how can I depend on you? There's a lot of things gonna change out here. And if you wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're gonna have to go
Listen, Nick, you gotta understand my situation. I'm responsible for thousands of people. I got a hundred million a year goin' through the place. It's all over, I'm gonna tell you, it's all over, if I don't get that license. And believe me, if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people, you understand?
Yeah, forget about your fuckin' license. I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin' license. You know, I don't know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you, the more I feel like you just don't wanna go along with me, is that it?
No, I don't wanna come -
You should say so.
I don't wanna come along with you.
Just say so.
I'll be honest with you.
All right, fine.
I don't wanna be involved in anything you're talkin' about...
...okay? I just wanna run a square joint. That's it. I just want my license. I want everything nice and quiet. That's it.
You mean, quiet like this: 'I'm the boss.' That's quiet?
That's all taken out of context. Okay.
Yeah, that's out of context. Okay.
I have no control over that. Ronnie and Billy were right there. They'll tell you exactly what happened.
Well, back home they don't know about fuckin' control. That looks bad.
Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad.
Yeah?
Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad.
What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me?
What happened to me? What happened to you?
Yeah.
You lost your control.
I lost control?
Yes, you lost your control.
Look at you. You're fuckin' walkin' around like John Barrymore.
All right.
A fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'...
All right.
...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?!
Yeah.
You know, I didn't want to bring this up, but you have treating a lot of people with a lot of disrespect. Even your own wife.
My wife?
Yeah.
Now, what does she have to do with all this?
Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident.
All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?
No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point.
Listen, I would -
The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem.
I - I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.
Hey, she came to talk...
Please...
...to me.
...don't do it to me...
She came to talk to me...
Okay?
And I - what was I supposed to do, throw her out?
Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that.
It's none of my business?
That's right, yeah.
A week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. In other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me.
This guy is gonna run to the FBI.
Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. That's your problem, pal.
I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it.
Fuckin' walking around with a big head. You better check yourself...
Nicky was questioned in two dozen murders, but they always had to let him go. There were never any witnesses.
Peekaboo, you fucks, you.
I see you, you motherfuckers.
...on the line and this guy's out havin' the time of his life. He has every cop in the state watchin' him, and he's out playin' golf.
Practice enough this week, you prick?
Yeah.
Meet me at three.
What - what, Caesar's?
No, a...
...hundred yards further down the road.
Why?
Where the fuck you get off talkin' to people about me behind my back? Goin' over my head?
What people?
What people! What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?
I don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nick.
No? You said I'm bringin' heat on you?! I gotta listen to people because of your fuckin' shit?! You're ordering me out?! You better get your own fuckin' army, pal!
I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't order you or anybody... I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem.
You want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?!
Yeah, I said I - let the bullshit blow over for a while so I can run the casino. Anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass. It's not yours, it's my ass.
Oh, I don't know whether you know this or not, but you only have your fuckin' casino because I made that possible!
I -
I'm what counts out here! Not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows! And what the fuck are you doin' on TV anyhow?!
What are you -
You know I get calls from back home every fuckin' day?! They think you went batshit!
I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino. You understand that. You know that. Come on.
Your fuckin' ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television! You wanted to go on TV.
Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's right.
You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself.
Me?! I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. You brought down so much fuckin' heat on me. I mean, every time I meet somebody here, the big question is do I know you.
Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?
No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told...
Back -
...you? Do you remember what I told you?
Back - Back up, back up a fuckin' minute here. One minute. I asked you?! When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here?! Get this through your head, you -
You never - ?
What are you doin'? You gotta get out of here!
Hey, Sammy, tell this Jew motherfucker over here to pay that marker.
Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin' to me. I'm here to help you. What's the matter with you? You're gonna bury us both.
Just give me the money. Fuckin' give me the fuckin' money, Sammy.
Ginger called me.
Yeah.
I just told you. She called me.
And what'd she want?
She was afraid to call you.
I know. Why didn't you come to me? I mean, this is family, it ain't business. Meanwhile, you make calls back home. Sammy, it makes us look bad out here, you know what I mean? Back and forth, this one and that one, and, in the meantime, she's gone anyway. Am I right?
I don't know. What am I gonna do with this woman? I don't know... She's drivin' me fuckin' crazy.
I think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
She's driving me fuckin' crazy.
Hello.
Sammy.
Yeah, uh, who's this?
It's me.
Yeah, what are you doin'? You okay?
No, I'm not okay.
How'd you know I was here?
...uh, you know, I just wanted to talk to you a minute.
Well...
...Ginger's missing and she tied Amy up and she locked her in her room. I gotta find her. I don't know where the hell she is.
Yeah? Well, listen, Ginger's over here at the Leaning Tower with me.
She's there with you? She's there with you?
Yeah, she's here.
Ace don't... listen, don't... don't make a scene, all right?
I want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch.
She didn't know who to turn to. She... she didn't know where to turn. She was tryin' to save your marriage.
Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch.
Mr Rothstein... I'm Pat Webb.
Hey, it is my pleasure.
Yeah, I heard a lot about you.
Hey, house is doin' well. Hey, all that money is rollin' in. I appreciate you takin' the time to see a poor ol' civil servant.
Uh, I come here personally to kind of smooth over a fracas about a certain matter. See, uh, maybe you didn't know it, but, uh, Don Ward is a very well-liked man in this town. He's got lots of friends here. Now, his family and their money go back many, many years. Now, friends vote... family and money votes. That's important to me... and
I'm sorry, but he knew about our gettin' hit on three big machines in a row and he did nothing about it. That means either he was in on it or, forgive me for saying this, he was too dumb to see what was going on. Either way, I cannot have a man like that workin' here.
Before we point the dirty end of the stick at 'ol Don, uh, we better be sure we can prove them charges.
Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest.
Are, uh - - are we certain that you want the Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro?
I think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that. What you're sayin' is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise. I went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. He's weak, he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the whole place. There's not much more I can do for him.
You have got me there. Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar. But, he is my brother-in-law, and I would look on it as a personal favor if you'd think some more on hirin' him back.
I can't do that. And I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in- law, and I do want to help you and I like to do favors, and I know who you are, but I cannot do that.
Well, could there be any position... further down the trough?
Okay, thanks. Um... you know, that's it. I'm sorry.
Mr Rothstein. Your people never will understand the way it works out here. You're all just our guests. But you act like you're at home. Let me tell you somethin', partner... you ain't home. But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the Governor. Thank you for your time.
No problem. Sorry.
Son-of-a-bitch. How the hell did you get Oklahoma-Michigan? Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi... How the hell'd you do it?
Well, that's why they paid so well.
You see? Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week?
Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right?
Okay. You come by the house?
I'll come by.
Seven o'clock?
Oh, yes. Will you help me fold these, please?
You go and put your things away.
Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster, and he didn't give a damn who knew it.
I mean, that's what worried me, 'cause it turns out Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas.
This is Jennifer and Nick. They're dear friends of mine.
You know, I don't feel like playin' tennis.
...as soon as Andy got back home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car.
Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
Hello.
Want something to drink? Charlie you want a refill?
Charlie, you've gotta - you've gotta stop her!
I-I'm sorry, Sam.
You've got to stop her.
What can I do?
Legally, she can't take that stuff. Legally, she can't take the stuff.
No, Ace.
Half of everything is mine.
Ace, listen to me.
Mr Rothstein, sir, let me put her on suspension.
Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'.
Well, sir, I was just...
Why is she eight pounds over?
...trying to offer you the respect that your...
I...
...position...
'Mr Rothstein' is good enough.
Mr Rothstein... well, sometimes, when you reach that pressure point, when you put that pressure point on them, you know, it shows...
She could at least lose half a pound or a quarter. Listen...
...and she doesn't always -
...all you do is give me answers. Just - just give me the right answer.
But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired.
That's right. She will get fired. In fact, I want you to send her back to Paris.
It's always been our policy -
I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager and I went to work.
...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room...
We need this guy.
We can't get rid of him?
He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.
I had dozens of politicians and state officials comin' through that place every week.
Nice to see you, Senator.
Help the Senator, give him whatever he wants.
Certainly. Senator.
Why not make them happy?
Fuckin' asshole won't budge.
This woman's an institution.
To Abraham Lincoln.
L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']
Sam, we got a problem.
What is it?
Now, he's really pissed.
He wants a fifty-thousand marker.
No, just - just give him, give him ten. That's it. Ten. I'll be right down.
Yeah, Billy Sherbert, please. Put him on.
Who's this?
Okay. Just take it easy.
Right away. Okay?
I-I'll do it.
I'm going to go powder my nose.
Ginger's mission in life was money.
I'll be right back.
Okay, thank you for asking.
She was a queen around the casino. She brought in high rollers and helped them spread around a lot of money.
Any change?
I hit a few... uh, games on the way back.
She took care of the dealers...
Hey, Mitch.
...pit bosses, floor managers.
Thank you.
...she took care of the valet parkers, the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything.
The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look at this creep.
Within no time, everything was set in place. We got rid of the freelance scamsters. The per was way up. The gods were happy, or as happy as the gods can ever be. And I, I decided to complicate my life. For a guy who likes sure things, I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real longshot.
We're not getting any younger. Don't you think it's time? Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? Bangin' around, hustlin' around?
What, are you trying to handicap me?
I'm gonna do you one better. I'm trying to marry you. You want to marry me? I'm serious. I mean, I - I want to settle down. I want a family.
You got the wrong girl, Sam.
I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother.
You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?
I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much. And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore.
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
Yeah, I know all that.
I care about you, a - But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.
I - I - I...
Understand? I'm sorry.
No, I - I... mean... that can grow as I - as long as there's a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I'm realistic. I can accept that. But, you know, what is... What is love anyway? It's a... it's a mutual respect. It's - it's a devotion. It's a... it's a caring from one person to another. And if we could
If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?
You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.
What're you... what're you pitching me, here?
You all right?
Yeah.
Why're you crying?
Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.
I'm okay. I just - You just have to understand. I've been with Lester since I was a kid. I just wanted to say goodbye. I - I just... I don't... I think I have a right to do that. Okay?
It's all right. That part of your life is over with. Right?
Yeah.
You're with me now.
Yeah.
Right?
Uh-huh.
You sure?
Want to go? Let's go back in.
You're kidding? My God. What is it?
It's chinchilla.
Oh, it's so soft.
It's nice isn't it?
So, do you think it's too much if I wear these in the same day?
You're so wonderful. The jewelry's not so bad, either.
The only thing is... you shouldn't keep this in the house. We gotta put it in a bank.
Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?
Now look, pay attention to me. What I'm gonna tell you is very important.
Okay.
Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks.
Need a little help with that, Mr Collins?
Hi. Nice to see you.
Hey, do you want to see this one? Daddy gave me all this jewelry because he loves me so much. Put your arm in there.
But as much as they loved her...
Oh, fabulous.
Okay, want to go with Mommy?
What do you need?
You get her? Okay. Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual.
Well, why don't you take it out of your account? There's a lot there.
Twenty-five thousand? For yourself?
Yeah.
Why do you need that much?
Well, what's the difference? I just need it.
Well, I mean... you know, I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money. You're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. I mean...
I'm aware of that. We don't have to turn this into a big deal. Okay? We don't have to have a fight. It was important to me. But forget it. Just something I wanted to do for myself.
Huh? Well, you know what? Now, I want you to tell me. I mean, my wife comes to me and asks me for twenty-five thousand. I mean, what do you want? Do you want a coat?
No.
Well, if you want a coat, you got it. You know that. It's not the money, it's just why do you want it? That's all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to that?
Look - Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this.
What are you talkin' a- ?
Okay? And you're embarrassing me. Why do want to make me feel so bad?
You're askin' me for twenty-five thousand. I'm not out to make you feel bad. I want to just be able to trust you. You now, it's about trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. Do you understand? Can I trust you? Can I trust you?... Can I trust you?... Answer me. Can I trust you?
You can trust me.
You remember when you called him that night? When you said goodbye to him? He didn't say, 'Don't get married, I'll be right down, we'll get married.' He didn't say that to you, did he?
No, he didn't.
Huh?
Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' too much, you're takin' all my pills too?
I didn't take your pills.
Look - for my ulcer, I take a half a one of these, a half a one of these. And that's when I have extreme pain. I had a three-month supply. What'd you do with 'em?
You didn't have to beat him up!
I was just tryin' to help him. It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy!
Yeah, how do I know?
You can't make me stop caring...
What? What?!
Listen. Ginger. I'm tryin' to make the best of everything here, you know? I mean, you're my wife, for chrissakes. Uh, I mean... people look up to you in this town. I don't know what to think -
It's okay. Look... ...you gotta get a hold of yourself.
Okay.
If not for me, at least for Amy.
Okay, okay.
You understand? Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones.
I don't need one.
Yes, you do. It's very discreet. There's no names in the papers. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff.
That's all you care about. You don't care about me at all.
Yes, I - yes, I do.
No, you don't.
How could you say that? You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody. You can do it. You can do
You see, if a phone's tapped, the Feds can only listen in...
...on the stuff involving crimes. So on...
...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
I mean she's only sober about two hours a day. It's usually from eleven in the morning until one in the afternoon. And if I gave her her money and her jewels now, you know what she's gonna do? She's gonna piss it all away in about a year, and then where will she be? Where would you be then? Comin' right back to
We had a deal. Remember that? He said if it didn't work out between us, that I could get my things and I could leave.
Well, that's why I'm here. She wants to come back, but she's afraid you're gonna whack her out.
Hello.
Hi, it's me. Just who you wanted to talk to, right?
...uh-uh-uh - I'm not gonna ask you where you are, just please, put Amy on a plane. Just put her on right away, any plane to get her here right away...
...please. That's all I'm askin' you.
Do you... I mean... I don't think she should go by herself.
What do you mean?
What I mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if I came back... do you think you could forgive me?
Uh, I don't know. I gotta tell you, I don't know.
Right.
I under-understand that. I-I know I fucked up.
What about the money? Uh, where's the box?
I gotta tell ya...
...I-I... made some mistakes and I spent some money.
What's it...
...under?
Pretty serious.
How serious?
It's, uh, it's under twenty-five.
It's under...
...twenty-five thousand?
Yeah.
And...
...the rest of the two million is still there?
Yeah, yeah, I got the rest.
Okay, no big deal. That's okay. Yeah. He got his twenty-five. That I'll live with. Any more I couldn't.
Okay?
So, what'd ya do with it?
With what?
With the money.
He needed some clothes.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes.
He wanted a watch, too.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch.
Mm-hm.
The good part was, I had Amy back. So, we went home, had the housekeeper stay over, put the kid to bed, I calmed myself down and we went to dinner. I tried to keep things nice and civil, you know. But... hey, twenty-five thousand for three suits? That doesn't make much sense.
First of all, he's not gonna wear f- thousand-dollar suits. But let's say he did, which he won't. How you gonna get fitted for twenty-five suits in three days? I, um, I mean, how could you get fitted that fast? I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much.
I bought him a watch too.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But even if you bought him a watch, a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice - and he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is - so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand?
Yeah.
Plus, at the most, three suits, a thousand apiece. That still leaves what? Around ten thousand?
Would you knock it off, Sam?
I'm just tryin' to figure it out.
Yes, I want to kill you! I hate your fuckin' guts!
Get off of me! Stop it!
I want you out of here! I want you out of here!
Take your fuckin' bag and get out of here!
The arrangement is over!
No kidding. NO KIDDING!
And I still get my money. I need some cash right now. You can't just put me in the street.
You're lower than a dog!
Here. Here. Is this enough money?! Huh? Will it last you two fuckin' days? Take it, greedy bitch. Take the fuckin' money you fuckin' want.
Yeah, no kidding. Good! It opens at 9 a.m. Be there!
Stop! You aren't getting rid of me with one fuckin' suitcase!
You'll come back tomorrow and get the rest. Just get out of here.
Fine. I'm takin' Amy.
You're not takin' Amy.
I am. I'm wakin' her up right now.
I am not! She's my daughter too! Goddamn you!
Hi. You didn't answer your beeper.
I threw it away.
You threw it away?
Look, I tried to do this thing. I know that you want me to, but it's just - You know, I'm driving down the freeway and the fuckin' thing's 'beep-beep-beep-beep'. You know, I'm in a restaurant and it's - it's embarrassing. I don't want to do it anymore. Where's Amy?
I put her to bed.
Oscar wants you to call him.
So, who'd you go to lunch with?
With Jennifer.
And where'd you go?
To the Riviera.
What'd you have?
I had a... salad.
What did Jennifer have?
She had the same.
Okay. I want you to call Jennifer and I want you to tell her to tell you what she had for lunch, and I'm gonna listen in on the other line.
Why do you want to do that?
You know why I want to do it. Just do it.
Fine. Just gonna get the bowl for my thing.
All right... I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.
Who were you with?
I was with somebody.
...she did what she did and I did what I had to do. But, Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing she could've done.
What if he won't stop?
I mean, it could get us both killed.
Hi, Sam.
I mean, you tie up our kid and you lock the fuckin' door? Are...
Oh...
...you out of your mind? That's our child. Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
It's just for a little while, Sam. The baby-sitter wasn't there.
I ought to fuckin' have you committed. You fuckin' do that again, I'll f-, I'll f-
She wasn't gonna get up. I was just gonna be out for a little while.
I should have -
I mean, she was asleep. I was going to be right back before she even woke up.
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me. Listen, you fuckin' cunt.
Oh, sh-
Listen to me.
Fuck you.
Let me tell you something. Listen to me.
I w- I was gonna be back before she woke up.
You listen carefully! You ever fuckin' touch her again, you ever do anything like that again, I'll fuckin' kill you. Pure and simple. Do you hear me? Pure and fuckin' simple, I'll fuckin' kill you, you bitch.
Why don't you just let me go, Sam?
You fuckin' whore!
I'll sign anything you want me to sign, okay?
You understand? What? Let you go?
I just want the key to my jewelry, and I want you to let me go.
You want your jewelry?
I want you to let me go.
Get - Get up! Get up!
I wou- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Get - get up!
I wouldn't do that...
I wouldn't -
Now you need approval from him to go home?
So what? So who fuckin' blew you in the parking lot before you came in... huh?
You make me sick, you fuck. Once a fuckin' hooker, always a hooker.
She, she's alone. Just go. Take the gun and go into Amy's.
You get down here!
Just wait there for me!
You come out here and talk to me, you fucker!
Will you stop it? You're drunk, you're on drugs. You're gonna -
I am not!
You're gonna be sorry if you don't stop that.
Don't you threaten me!
You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
You are not threatening me anymore!
I won't let her in. I'm sorry, Randy, I'm not gonna let her in. She - Well, I'm not gonna let her in, the way she's behaving. I'm - I'm -
Not gonna let me in?
Who knows what you're gonna do in there? I don't want you -
I'm afraid to let her in the house.
Oh, you are...
I'm afraid she's gonna destroy stuff.
Should I let her in like - ?
If she calms down, I will let her in the house.
I am calm!
After all the threats and all the bullshit, it turned out Ginger didn't tell 'em anything. But by then, the Feds didn't need her, anyway.
But it was just mine.
Yeah, thanks for not callin' me a liar. You son-of-a-bitch. You son-of- a
...'Ace' Rothstein, accused the state's top gaming officials of corruption.
What are you running for, Bob? What are you running for?
...and hypocrisy.
- you could put 'em on your expense account?
In a Wild and unprecedented outburst that followed his gaming license denial, Rothstein followed several...
...stunned commissioners into the hallway, where he continued his harangue until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave.
We all have a past. You have a past, I have a past. And my past is no worse than yours. But you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me.
Long suspected of running the Tangiers without...
...Well, I've got a large family.
How many kids do you have?
Uh, I'm very proud to say that we have eight children.
Eight children!
No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please.
That's amazing.
It won't happen again, Sam.
Loose machines are right back over there.
What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there.
Okay, I'll -
What about the progressives with the high jackpots? Where are they? These machines are hidden.
Well...
These are our best machines. They bring all the action. No wonder the drop is off.
Yeah, okay.
The action is in the front, not in the back. Bring 'em up front.
All right, I will, I will.
Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here. The right way, the wrong way, and the way I do it. You understand?
I do understand that. I'll get right on it. And thank you.
Don't thank me, just do it. You're the Slots Manager. I shouldn't have to tell you this.
Four reels, sevens across, three fifteen-thousand-dollar jackpots? Do you have any idea what the odds are?
Shoot, it's gotta be in the millions, maybe more.
Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me?
Well, it happened so quick. Three guys won. I didn't have a chance to call you.
You didn't see the scam? You didn't see what was goin' on?
Well, there's no way to determine that, Sam.
Yes, there is. An infallible way! They won!
Well, it's a casino. People gotta win sometimes.
The probability on one-four-reel machine is a million and a half to one. On three machines in a row, it's in the billions. It cannot happen... would not happen, you fuckin' momo! What's the matter with you! Didn't you see you were bein' set up on the second win?
I really think you're -
You - Wait! You didn't see that you were being set up on the second win?
I really think you're overreacting in this whole -
Listen, you fuckin' yokel, I've had it with you. I've been carryin' your ass in this place ever since I got here. Get your ass and get your things and get out of here.
You're firin' me?
You might regret this, Mr Rothstein.
I'll regret it even more if I keep you on.
This is not the way to treat people.
...worst possible time for me.
A record of the arrests...
I had my license hearing coming up and I didn't wanna leave anything to chance.
That was nineteen years ago, and they were simple gambling pinches.
I mean, if I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go?
You've been very open with us. I mean, uh, your books and papers and... that - that's gonna mean something when you go before the Commission.
Ah, yes, here we are. A little craps figures. [Actual amount taken from craps tables before the skim.] Hey - Hey.
We had to make an example of these pricks that the party was over.
I'm just curious. I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand. Can you do that with both hands?
No.
Can't do it with both hands?
No, Sir.
Can you do it with your left hand?
Well, I... I never tried.
So, you're a righty?
Now, you're gonna have to learn with your left hand.
Look what they did to my hand, man!
Excuse me.
What?
Is this yours? Your pen?
Yeah, that's my pen. Why?
I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just didn't know whose it was. I thought it was yours. I didn't want it to get lost.
I just wanna get out of here.
And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand?
I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.
You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw? We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it?
Yeah.
Get out of here.
When I left here with the money...
Mm.
...I got muscled on the street.
Mm.
A couple of guys, I owe them. So, that's what I did. I gave 'em the money. That's what I did.
Yeah?
Yeah.
No, no? You didn't?
I didn't give 'em the m-
Fuckin' kids at home! Here. Get the fuck out of here.
Thanks, Nick.
Hey... you got a minute? Hey. He's got two million in the box, am I right? Okay, you let him keep your jewels. We take the cash and the only other thing he cares about. Huh? Her majesty. We go to Europe. You dye your hair, get some pl-
I don't want to go to Europe. I want to go to see The Elephant Man.
I don't want to go to Europe.
You know where she gets this from!
You shut up.
I was out there with my cumma [Italian- American slang for 'girlfriend'.]
Your cumma? What are you doin' with your cumma?
You gotta go back there and talk to that guy.
Come on, go back there? I never got paid my expenses for the last trip.
What expenses?
Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell's goin' on?
You gotta go back out there.
Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.
Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?
Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?
Yeah, that works out.
But how much cash could I bury in my closet, right?
You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.
Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.
So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.
I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark?
Yes.
No, I don't want one. Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'?
Hi. Good.
I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President.
Well, I've been busy.
Yeah, least you could do is return my phone calls, though.
Listen... Nicky... we talked about this... and, uh, I explained to you that there was the possibility you might have to take some kind of loss.
Yeah. I think I want my money back.
What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?
You know... I think that you've gotten the wrong impression about me. I think in all fairness, I should explain to you what it is that I do. For instance, tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you, and, uh... if you don't have my money for me, I'll crack
You can't talk to me like...
Hey, you fat Irish prick. You put my fuckin' money to sleep. You go get my money, or I'll put your fuckin' brain to sleep.
Sam?
Go back inside! This is none of your business! I don't have to take your shit all the time anymore.
Hey.
Mrs Ro- Mrs Rothstein! Okay, shh!
He won't let me in my own house!
Mr Rothstein. Mr Rothstein, I'm sorry. We've got some complaints about - about the noise.
I'm just trying to get in my house!
I understand.
Fucker!
Can I go in?
That's not a problem, that's not a p-
Can I go in?
Um, I'm gonna need a bag. If you could just ask the guy for a big bag, okay?
Go get a bag, man.
And here. Here.
No, you can, you can. You've been so nice to me.
You just - Just stop him.
What do you want? It - It's pitch- black out here. It's tin foil.
Pitch-black?! It -
It looked like a fuckin' gun!
You - You fuckin' moron, I'll be filling out paper work for the next two months because of you and this piece of shit, you...
Oh my God, what are we gonna do? I'm sorry.
Hey!
All right. Okay, okay.
Hey, Mr Rothstein, it'll make it a lot easier on everybody here if we just let her in the house.
Come on. I'm sorry.
There's nothing we can do. She had the key.
Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You mind accompanying us outside?
Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you!
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Yeah?
You know who you're fuckin' with?! Huh? Do you?!
Now move along.
Leave me alone!
Here we go!
You called my friend a faggot? You tell him to go fuck himself?
Nicky, I did -
Is that what you did?
I did - I didn't -
You took your boots off? You put your feet on the table... you shit- kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smellin' motherfucker you! You fuck me up over there, I'll stick you in a hole in the fuckin' desert! You understand? Go over there and apologize. Go! Get the fuck out of -
Beautiful. You got a beautiful swing.
Ace got my son, little Nicky, involved with Little League, and it was great.
Now, I want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles, okay? 'Cause that's what's gonna win this game.
Turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'...
Now go out there and show your dad what you can do.
...metro intelligence cop. But it didn't matter. I mean, it was all about the kids, you know.
You know, he's gotta realize everything can't be a home run that he does.
Yeah, well, that's exactly what I keep tellin' him, but that's the kind of kid he is ever since he's born.
It's instinctive, you know.
...in some legitimate places, like my restaurant.
I had my kid brother, Dominick, run it for me.
Do you see that? Dumb Jew motherfucker. Grew up together and he's actin' like he don't even know me. I know we're supposed to avoid each other, but, you know, there's ways to do things and there's ways not to.
Forget about it, Nick. Don't let it bother you.
He's comin' over.
Oh.
We're waiting on Carmine.
Carmine left?
He's gone?
He's not here?
Hey, Nicky, how are you? What are you doin' here?
Yeah, I'm over here with him.
Carmine? He was here before. I saw him. He had a suitcase and everything, and then he left.
Carmine left?
I think, you know, maybe he went across the street or somewhere else or somethin'. I don't know.
Well, listen, uh... Good luck with the joint, huh?
Artie!
Calm down! Calm down!
No, I won't calm down! He's my husband!
Stay out of the way!
Artie! Artie!
We're - we're placing you under arrest for -
For what?
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting -
What?
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting a -
Hey, Frankie.
How are you?
...I want all the names of all the other people he had with him. And I don't care what you have to do to him to get 'em. You understand?
I'll take care of it, Remo.
Frankie... they found a guy's head in the desert. Do you know about that?
Yeah, I heard, yeah.
Yeah. Everybody's talkin' about it. They're makin' a big deal out of it.
I know.
It's in all the papers.
What're you gonna do?
And I mean... that's no good.
I know.
You gotta tell him... to take care of things a little better.
Frankie, I want to ask you something.
It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth.
Of course, Remo.
I want you to tell me the truth, mind you.
I always tell you the truth, Remo.
Frankie... the little guy, he wouldn't be fuckin' the Jew's wife, would he? Because if he is... it's a problem.
What could I say? I knew if I gave the wrong answer, I mean, Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of 'em could've would up gettin' killed.
Because there's one thing about these old timers: They don't like any fuckin' around with the other guy's wives. It's bad for business.
So, I lied... even though I knew that by lyin' to Gaggi, I could wind up gettin' killed too.
No. I ain't see anything like that.
Are you sure?
I'm positive. Remo... things are very fucked up down there, you know?
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky.
Hm.
I want to know... if he's doin' all right. If he's okay.
He's good. He's fine.
I'm askin' you, Frankie, to keep an eye on Nicky. Do it for me.
No problem.
You see... I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for people who are our friends. You understand?
I understand.
You got a round figure on it?
But back then the bosses didn't give a fuck about whether he enjoyed himself of not. To them, he was a cash register. All they had to do was ring the bell and take the money. Especially Remo, who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost.
I mean, unless Ace made his bet.
Ace.
Hey, Nick. Vien acca. [Italian- American slang for 'Come here']
I'll be right out.
T'aggia parla. [Italian-American slang for 'I've got to talk to you'] Nicky... See that guy?
Mm.
Keep a good eye on him. He's makin' a lot of money for us. And he's gonna continue makin' a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him.
Mm.
Not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains. Okay?
All right.
Uh-huh. Mi raccomando. [Italian- American slang for 'I'm counting on you']
Yeah.
Fine.
Uh-huh. Good.
But I knew how to keep the bosses happy. Whenever they gave me little jobs to do, you know, to send a message, I would carry things out...
Hi, Jennifer.
Pleasure. Very nice to meet you.
Hi, how are you?
Tell me.
I know it wasn't a nice thing to do but -
Well, you gotta understand it. He doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down or taking advantage of you.
No! No! I told him all about the guy before we ever got married. This is no fuckin' surprise.
Oh, you did? I didn't know that.
Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so... so what?
I never see - You know, I never seen him act like that with anybody else. I think he's crazy about you. I mean, he really loves you. He does.
Oh, come on. I went into this with my eyes open, you know. I knew the bottom could drop out at any time. I'm a working girl, right? You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end.
Sure.
Am I right?
I can see that. Sure.
So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
You mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? About how much?
Mm, you want to steal it?
No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all.
I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more.
Well, there you go. But what does that tell ya? A million dollars in jewelry. Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what?
I should have never married him. He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini... duality. Gemini's the snake. You know you can't trust the snake. I mean it.
Listen, Ginger... you know, this is probably not... I don't have the answers anyway... and this is probably not what you want to hear right now, because you're a little upset with Ace.
I do.
I understand that. But, you know, I think you should try to make the best of it now. Go slow, you know. See what happens.
He didn't have to hit him. It's not exactly like I'm sleepin' with the guy! And he makes me sneak around to see my own friends! What the fuck is that all about?
Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. He's jealous and worried.
He gives a fuck what I do?
Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him.
Okay.
All right?
And take it easy with this shit, will you? I mean, this can only make matters worse.
Oh, come on.
You're a beautiful girl. You don't want to ruin your looks. I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.
You're so nice.
Thanks.
Thank you.
You just relax. Nobody's killin' anybody, do you hear?
No, I really do. I think he's gonna kill me.
You just relax, and call me back here in exactly an hour, on this phone, and I'll see what I can do.
So, I'm gonna call you back in an hour... at this number, and you're gonna be there, right?
I'll be there.
And listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay? You all right? Okay.
I mean, listen, two people don't get along, at some point you gotta call it... I mean, it's none of my business, but I ... I think that's what you gotta do. You gotta take it somewhere -
Oh, you're right, I know. It's... well, I was just -
What? What?
Nothin'.
What were you gonna say? Go ahead.
I don't -
Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank... could help me get my jewelry out? There's a lot of money in there. Lot of money in there, and I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
Let me think about that.
Okay.
See who I got in there. Gotta get somebody I can trust.
Mm-hm.
You know?
Yeah. 'Cause, you know, He's never gonna give me my jewelry.
Hm.
He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
He's so fuckin' lucky. I could have buried him. I could have gone to Europe and taken the baby. And then he'd've tracked me down and he'd've killed me.
No, he wouldn't. I would have. And he'd've been right, too. I mean, seriously. Well, there's one thing you don't do. You don't take a guy's kid and then take off.
I didn't. I didn't. I mean, I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came right back.
You did. You're right.
You did. I like that. I like that. That's what I like about you. You did the right thing.
I did what you told me to.
Yes, you did.
'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do.
Yeah. Boy, he really fucked himself up out here - - didn't he?
Sure did.
No, he's not.
He really thinks who the fuck he is, I'll tell you that.
He hates my fuckin' guts.
Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this. Don't cry.
I'm not as tough as you think I am.
Yes, you are.
I'm not and he scares the shit out of me. I never know what he's gonna do.
Come on. Don't be scared.
I do. I need a new sponsor.
Is that what you want?
Yeah.
A sponsor.
Yeah.
Mm... okay. Don't worry about it. Nobody'll fuck with ya anymore. I'll take care of ya.
Nicky, please...
Yes, I will. It's what you want, isn't it? Huh?
Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's what you want?
What did I tell you? Supposing he goes back home and makes a fuckin' beef? I gotta know exactly what you said. Tell me what you said to him.
Me? I said... nothin'. I said, I said, 'No, no, no.' Everything he said, I just kept sayin' no.
I told you this was fuckin' dangerous. Remember I said, 'Ginger, this is a dangerous situation. Be very careful.' You fuckin' yessed me to death.
If it's so fuckin' dangerous, then why don't you kill him?
I'm not gonna kill him. Shut the fuck up. What, do you know what you're talkin' about? I'm not killing anyb-
Oh, well, then, have him killed and get it over with.
Hey, don't be such a fuckin' smartass, will you? I mean, I know the fuckin' guy thirty-five years, I'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you? Fuck... motherfucker! I knew this, I knew it.
What about my money?
Ah, you fuck! You're such a fuckin' asshole!
Get the fuck out of here.
I don't need you! I have my own fuckin' money!
I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared anymore!
All right. Be careful.
You fucked with me for the last time!
So, what'd you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway?
I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.
Great.
You know, I've got to do some shopping afterwards. Do you want to go?
...same outfit.
Yes!
Thank you. Very nice.
I'm sorry.
Thank you, sir, I appreciate that. Everybody, thanks. Gives some chips as tips to the dealer and box man. Thanks. Take care, Steve. Take chances and drive fast.
Come on.
What's the matter?
What do you mean, 'What's the matter?' I made a lot of money for you. I want my cut.
What money? I've seen you stealing from me.
What money? Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end.
Ginger, I've been watching you all night. You've been stealing from me.
Don't give me that shit. I want my money.
That bag's full of fuckin' chips you
Get lost, Ginger! Get lost!
Get lost?
Yes.
Get lost?
Well, how 'bout that?
All right.
Okay?
Yeah.
Where are you goin'? Where are you? You're in that place. Where are you?
I'm here.
No, you're not. Where are you? Where are you?
I'm always here for you.
You are.
Don't make me come there. Answer me.
Bub-ut, baby, do you know that I love you too?
No, Lester.
Do you know that?
Yeah. This is the best thing I can do for my life right now.
So, it's gonna be okay, isn't it?
Promise?
...all the luck in the world.
You do?
- with stupid braces on your teeth.
Okay, then.
Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.
What does that mean? No, I know that look. What does that mean?
It means I got the money.
We'll go later.
Don't give me any of your shit! Okay, this has always been a dream, but we're going.
Lester - he called you here.
Right.
Here.
He was just on the phone.
He called you right here.
I just talked to him.
So, he knows where you are. That means he's sending some guys over here probably right now.
Ginger... It means he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting for me to call him back. Now, I -
That's - Yeah, he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, just waiting for you to call him back. That's what he's -
He's sittin' by the phone -
What do you think we're gonna do? He's probably got guys outside the fuckin' house!
Get your bag! Come on, get your bag! Get your things! Let's go!
It's this bullshit. It's just bullshit right here. This is the fuckin' problem, you know.
Oh, what bullshit? What, do you want to fuckin' talk it over now?
You're done yakkin', okay? You're done yakkin' now?
Go! Go! Get in the car! Go!
Just knock it off! Would you two knock it off? Get in the car.
You're not gonna drive. Don't even think you're gonna drive.
No, I'm gonna drive.
No, I'm not gonna drive with some crazy -
- back to Nigeria. Yeah.
Listen...
...they're in Penthouse K.
They check in alone?
They checked in alone.
Are they out now?
Yes, don't worry.
Excuse me, but I folded these things beautifully and I would appreciate a little respect. Jesus Christ!
There's more!
I think that's it.
There's more! There's a couple stuck in there. I know there's more.
God, I'm telling you, they're out!
Look, there aren't... There aren't but...
Hey, how you doin'?
Wow.
Boy, look at this place, huh?
Incredible.
How many of these you gonna eat, huh?
Two.
Mm-hm.
You know why, right?
Yeah.
Why?
'Cause it clogs up your heart.
Well, how come I laid nine?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Ace saw Vegas one way.
You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
Smarten up.
...you big fuckin' hick, you. Come here. Come here. Get him up. Come here.
Get up.
Come here, come here.
Get up.
Sometimes I used to go along on a heist just for the fun of it. But I didn't like the people I was rippin' off lookin' at me, so I used to turn their fuckin' pictures around.
What's takin' so long over there?
Whenever we got local merch, we'd usually send it to Palm Spring or Arizona... LA. I had a couple of sand niggers out there. You know, Arabs.
I actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault where I kept the choice stuff.
She asleep?
Give all the guys in your crew a piece of that?
I took care of everybody.
You walk past me?
Hey. This is Shelly.
And this is Stacy.
Stacy.
This is Nick.
...Remo and the guys used to hang out and count their millions.
I mean, the cops knew, but they didn't give a fuck. I mean, you know, they all worked it out together.
Fine. Everything's goin' good.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
...bosses. I mean, they're smokin' their Di Nobilis and they're eatin' a trippa [Italian-American slang for 'tripe'.] and fuckin' suffritt', you know, fried pigs guts? While, if I wanna talk private, I gotta go to a fuckin' bus stop.
But, hey, what do they care, as long as I keep sendin' money back.
Yeah, but they're complaining.
I do all the work. Somebody don't like it, fuck him.
It's up to you.
Mm.
Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't they?
They're havin' a good time too.
He's here.
Sue me, you Jew fuck!
Let's get out of here.
You must have drunk too much.
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
Yeah, what'd you tell him?
I told him I didn't know nothin'. But Jiggs and, uh, Tony Gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up.
You think he's goin' home, makin' a beef behind my back?
Nah. You would've heard somethin'.
Yeah, what's to stop him?
I know. I know.
I don't trust him anymore. But they'd never okay anything, you know?
Yeah, but they keep askin' about it.
Well, now, sure they're askin'. They earn with the prick. I got a funny feelin' he's gonna start a fuckin' war or somethin'. I'm not sure yet, you know. But I w- You know, but you know what I want you to do?
Who's this guy? Who's this guy?
Oh, he ain't nobody.
You know what I want you to do? Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let 'em show you where it's at.
Angelo and Buster.
Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.
They'll do it.
And when I'm ready, I'll say the words, 'Go see the Jew.'
Yeah.
And you make it disappear, you know what I mean?
Yeah, just let me know. But you gotta be ready. You know what I'm talkin' about?
Don't know.
Dominick said they're in the motel?
Calm down, calm down. Shh!
Whoa. Calm down.
Get out. Get out! Get out!
Take it easy!
Why'd I get involved with this fuckin' nut in the first place? Get out!
You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take it easy.
I fucked up, Frankie. I fucked up good this time. Should have never started with this fuckin' broad.
Take it easy. What could you do? I mean, she threw herself at you, right?
Frankie!
Frankie! Frankie, you piece of shit!
No more fuckin' dirty work!
No, no, no, no!
Listen to me, Anthony. I got your head in a fuckin' vise. I'm gonna squash your fuckin' head like a grapefruit if you don't give me a name. Don't make me have to do this, please. Come on. Don't make me be a bad guy. Come on.
Fuck you!
Oh, God! Give me the fuckin' name!
Ch-Charlie M!
Charlie M?
Charlie M.
Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker!
Kill me, you fuck, kill me.
Tony.
Hey.
How you doin'?
How you doin'?
All right, yeah. You got that thing for me?
What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'.
I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it. I was takin' it.
You sure?
I'm positive.
Well, I'm a little confused here.
You're a little confused?
Yeah.
I'm sorry, Nicky. I didn't mean anything by it.
My fuckin' head.
Pardon me, counselor. Before you continue...
No, I want to have this marked, Mr. -
...this, uh, this Commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the Rothstein application.
Denying?
Do I hear a motion seconded?
Hey! Oh!
Oh, sorry -
What's the matter with you?
Receipts and bills and... everything's here.
Since when do you talk like that?
I'm sorry.
There's a lot of people here.
Nance gives me trouble and I'll tell him... screw around with those suitcases and I'll take the eyes out of his frickin' head.
Again!
I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'.
That's enough.
I've never trusted him. And you know I got eyes...
...behind my head. They trust that scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel.
All right, take it easy now, take it easy.
Mom, I'm sorry, they're beatin' me left and right. Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset.
I know, but that's enough.
You know - You know - You know what they're doin' to me?
I know it, I know it.
I can't take this no more. Back and forth, back and forth.
Take it easy, though.
All right, all right. But I - I -
You'll get a heart attack like that.
...everything's comin' out of my pocket. I gotta pay for all these trips back and forth, back and forth.
...done right, you gotta do it yourself.
Hiya. That's a lot of money to be counting out in public.
Yeah.
Hi.
Yes, uh...
You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need...
Hey, Hot Stuff. You're still on the clock...
The crowd bought it.
Do I have to remind everyone that in two days, we'll all be dead. The Cult of Good will be a memory. I don't want to hear about lawsuits or cereals. We have a secret mission...
I still have to call my agent--my techno-single just made the hot 100...what's with the phone?
Oh Man, not the sewer, I just had this cape cleaned...
Have we reached the epi-center?
Works for me.
I'm not going to worry about it. We are quite beyond the computer disc. Everything will be over within the next hour or so.
Yew'll be ovah in the naxt tehn minutes...
Cactus, I can't believe you just said all that...
I thought we were going to take it easy until the Mission...
Ah, Cats. Now and Forever.

You know, nobody likes you...
He likes you. Kincaid and I have always had similar tastes...
In women?
No, in art. I try not bring up women around Kincaid. It's a sore spot between us. Long story..
I'll bet. Funny, for some reason, I don't think dogs are supposed to like me.
You say that like an amnesia victim.
Guilty. I am.
Ouch. I hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men.
Strange--you seemed so close. I wonder what's happened since yesterday..
What's the matter...
Nothing, just a jolt of deja-vu. I think I went out with a guy with a dignified British butler--can't remember how it turned out..
I'll bet the butler's name wasn't "Jeff."
You're probably right.
How heroic of you...
Kincaid got a little frisky last night...So, meet here at eight and go from there? By the way, I'm Brock Leviathan.
But of course you are. Dinner at Eight. Wouldn't miss it.
There's a nice cafe down the street...unless you're afraid of this Catwoman prowling around. We can always dine at the mansion, if..
You designed Gotham Plaza? The big silver guys pulling on those big silver things...
What did you think?
Oh, it's superb--I mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing...
Hey, hey, the client comes first. You think I want my future children to know their Daddy created Frank's Fun Palace?
I checked out your stuff at the library. Awesome work, really. Why would someone like you want to go out with a...with a..what exactly am I, again?
I despise these kind of winds. Sorry, I guess I'm a little on edge. Seems this Catwoman has everyone, men and women, on edge. Don't you feel Catwoman says something about the duality of all men and women...
Stop. We are not having a "duality" conversation. "Ooh, he has a secret side. Ooh, she has a dark side." Please. Duality is a joke. You get one, do you understand me? You get one life. One shot. I'm so tired of women saying "I have an inner strength" or "Deep down, I'm really ambitious." "One day I'll design my own line of clothing
I'm sorry I went off like that, I get passionate. I--I guess I'm a passionate person. One of those things I had forgotten. When you were a little boy did you want to grow up to be a superhero?
What little boy doesn't... My God...it's, it's...Catwoman.
A whip? Now that's going too far! Some of these women have no shame!
What's the matter? What are you saying?
This is insane. Let the heroes handle it. I'd better get you home...I should check on my warehouse to make sure it hasn't been hit...
Your warehouse? Go on ahead--to your "warehouse." I'll be okay...
Are you sure?
Selina, did you make it home, all right? I tried calling, but your mother said that there was "no extension in the Hut." Whatever that means..
I got home fine. How's the "warehouse."
Fine. You're angry. Don't be. The important thing is we're together now..
At some sanctimonious celebration of condescension. Nothing like appeasing half the population with a two hour luncheon.
Exactly. I don't know what I'd do without you.
Tonight, somewhere in the city, innocent people will die--but then one of you knows that; for one of you is a vicious pirate-terrorist posing as the beloved superhero Captain God.
Hmm. Not bad.
No-o. You know, questions like that don't help your cause--
Quite a pair we make. Thank you, Jeff.
Oh now, you put up a good fight. Let's change the subject. Where do people who live in Oasisburg go to get away from it all?
This ring belonged to my sister. I'd love for you to...
It would be honor, Brock. Now let's go get this guy...
In many ways, that obnoxious creep Cactus was the worst one of all. He got off on giving out pain...
I thought you said you weren't a very good liar.
There you are darling...Have we met, Lewis Lane, Oasisburg Times.
Oh, how long have you had your own route?
Women, huh?
They do take their time. So..Selina Kyle...
Selina Kyle...lovely person.
She has a real spirit.
A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?
She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
I better go report this in...
Selina, are you okay?
You're kidding.
You're right, I wasn't looking to fall in love with a casino worker. I'd given up trying to find anyone. But there was a fire in your eyes that cut right through the air conditioning and through the coldness of my heart.
We're waiting.
Quiet, Blender Boy. I told you from the beginning, Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I am not Captain God, or whatever else he may be calling himself this month, but when I find out who is--The Man will pay. My sister died in that Museum attack. You can check the Atlanta obituaries. I've tracked these monsters from city to city, waiting for
I can. That's not an admission of guilt, It's just..I knew you had it in you...
I've been looking for you.
I've been looking for you. Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader.
But then we knew that all along, didn't we...
I guess we did. When you were a little boy, did you want to be a superhero?
You've lost all motor functions. The poison will kill you in ten minutes.
Hey, speaking of Wrong Place, Wrong Time. Lewis Lane to the rescue!
Don't you feel so much better now that you know everything? Blink once for yes, twice for..
Boss, we better roll if we're going to hit this place, blow it up, and make that flight..
God, can you hear me!
Wha-at?
Catwomen. Lots of them!
I thought cats were supposed to have nine lives, not thirty one! What do you think you're doing?
Winning.
What do you want from me?
At this point, a nap. Oh by the way, I killed your butler and your dog..
Oh Honey, it's so much better when we do it without the helmet.
I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it! I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together. We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and
Pass!
You were right all along--the two parts to a person are the reality and the lie. I was making good money as a top architect--but that's not who I am. I'm not an architect, I'm a..
Will you please stop fighting? Just let those people die so we can get on with our new lives together! Trust me, one day we'll look back on this day and laugh. You got to admit, it's a lot more fun to be the villain.
You might be right, but Fun is overrated. I need something real.
Don't you realize there's nothing you can do, anyway! Nine minutes and it's all over! The Fun Palace is a tomb. No one can get out. And choke on this furball: all doors and windows are blocked, locked, and electrified! Even the glass around the bomb is rigged.
Even the skylight?
The "skylight?" Fool! It's too high for anybody to climb out the damn skylight...
The shopkeeper on 13th street won't drop the lawsuit--He still claims one of the lasers we fired at the Jenkins gang burned down his store..
"Dat's gotta hurt!"
What's the catch?
Not now, Mammoth. Adonis is right. We've had a good run here--the protection kickbacks from the crime syndicates, the merchandising scams-- Tomorrow night we have a big, violent, complicated and lucrative mission to pull off. We chould be resting up.
Yeah, this is better than rape.
Cactus, sometimes you don't deserve to wear our logo.
What a "drag."
Cactus--shooting a man in the back is not very noble.
That is not a man, Captain God. That is Vomit accidentally born with two legs.
Boss-man, what were you going on about last night: "I am the Law and I am the Danish..."
Right time. That was kind of fun. She had spunk.
I don't know, Boss, you saw what the big guy did to the last kitty we gave him.
God-damn..
What did you say?
Sorry man, I didn't mean that personally...
Ah, did you hear that? Spooky loved you...
Quite a little performance you gave in the casino today--for me and that other guy. Come on down, let's chat..
Car wash, Captain?
My, the Perpetrator seems to be a bit on the "Wild" side..
Oh, I wish they wouldn't feed him like that.
Well, we spent enough time building the damn thing, might as well use it.
Well, you don't see that everyday. Somebody tell me what's the deal with Frida Kahlo here?
You like them, don't you, Boss.
The Tranquilizer Tranquility will hold for about an hour..where is she? These women are out here on a lark-- Ladies Night at a discotheque. It's not in their blood the way it is for Catwoman...Where is she?
I hate it when you get like this. This Catwoman is becoming an obsession. I say we call it a night. Tomorrow is a big day for us...
I want out of tonight's mission. I can't do it anymore, Captain. I can't let innocent people die to prove our superiority..I can't.
Why are you--I fought for you with honor. Why should it matter if I'm a man or a woman, as long as I'm a good warrior.
I loved you.
You're not a super-hero. You're not even a hero. You're a scary, sick, fake who made a big mistake. You killed someone very special to me..
Hasn't anyone ever taught you that fighting violence with violence solves nothing.
It's a lot more fun than fighting violence with pamphlets. That voicebox of yours is a hoot. Say "I'm wearing no underwear"--it'll be funny.. You do know you're evil, don't you?
A superhero's job is to protect society. Don't blame me if society is a horrible, corrupt joke.
"A superhero's job is to protect.." Sorry, I can't take you seriously...I overheard you say that tomorrow the Cult of Good will be dead--I should be so lucky--what did that mean?
My, those little ears pick up a lot. The Cult of Good will die heroically preventing a world-class heist. Since we will be the ones performing the heist, our deaths will obviously be fake. But have no fear. There will be many other deaths tomorrow...and those will be quite real. I'm afraid these questions of yours put you in a position not unlike a
Oh please, sir, one more. Are you the reporter or the architect?
Yes. I am the reporter or the architect. You've been through so much..It looks like you've used up all nine of your lives...
I still have one left...
You think so?...Selina?
How can you say things with such feeling and then turn around and put on a helmet and...Who are you? Were you sitting on my right or my left at the card table? Tell me! Please tell me who you are; you own me that!
I'm supposed to be taking personality tips from you three? You people were once heroes. You had ideals. You fought for things. Spooky told me so...
Ah, the good guys always triumph in the end. It's what allows our children to sleep at night.
Spooky.
Hello, Spooky.
I don't want to hurt you, Catwoman. Yet. After tomorrow, you can do anything you want, but please, just stay out of sight for the next 24 hours. I won't stand by and watch my leader get all emotional over an animal like you. I warn you, don't tempt Captain God when he is angry. Let is complete our mission in peace.
Can't you understand--I got tired of being a woman. I wanted the respect that only a cape, boots, chestplate, and a mechanical spear can bring..
I heard what you said, Spooky. I can't believe he shot you...
For when the time comes..
For when the..Uh, yeah, thanks, a little gold piece of...gold. Uh...
Oh no, not a computer disc. A computer disc? Oh man, come on, what do I look like? I'm not a crime- fighter, I'm not a detective, what, I'm supposed to find some "clues" on this disc. I can't...
The Mission is happening tonight..It's up to you to...to save the City...
"Save the City?" I don't want to save the city, I want to move! Listen, I'm sure the computer disc is pretty fascinating and I can't thank you enough for the little weird gold thingie, but..
You know, my name's not Spooky. It's, it's Rachel.
You Housewives have no idea what we go through!
You Career girls have no idea what we go through.
I'm a good mother!
You mean, "Consuela" is a good mother..
How did you know our nanny's name is...Lucky guess!
What's the name of your child's best friend?
You're late. I've got some good news and some good news. I'm giving you more hours and the new uniforms came in.
You know, Kyle, you're still pretty hot for a pre-Bicentennial babe...
"Pre-bicentennial babe?"
There you are, Selina. I've been thinking..I have some.."positions" opening up..
Stop.
Oh, what? I offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it's "sexual harassment..."
Hey, you're anti-male.
Oh Frank, I'm not anti-male, I'm anti- you. Believe me, there's a difference. Kelly is designing new uniforms for next week. Pay her and thank her. And is it a rule that the hottest places on the planet have the coldest air conditioning. There's something out there called 73 degrees, look into it.
What if I were to say "You're Fired?"
What if I were to say "Your Wife"-- as in does she know of your touching mentor-student relationship with the post-Bicentennial babe working the roulette wheel?
A genuine woman of mystery in Oasisburg. Amnesia. Bulletholes in exposed stomach badly concealed with body make-up. Beautiful, intelligent eyes that have no business in "Frank's Fun Palace" or anybody else's Fun Palace for that matter..
I don't know what came over me.
What is it with women and Catwoman? Men have the courtesy to punish the weak, but women love punishing the strong. Don't get me wrong--this Catwoman is a terrifying, subversive menace to everything this community stands for and she must be stopped. It's just, I like her a lot.
Yeah, she's okay.
Sorry, I get carried away. Once I become interested in someone, I can't stop trying to figure them out...Amnesia victims are challenging..
I actually got some memory back last night.
How much?
Enough.
Oh the hand--my grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender and..You know, I realize I've never officially introduced myself...I'm Lewis Lane.
But of course you are.
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...
I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan...
Good morning.
Ah! You scared me! How did you know to come here! Have you been spying..
No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of..
Next time, call...
Hey, Captain God!
What did--?
You turned around!
Yes, you shouted the words "Captain God" at me for no reason...
Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?
Did you try to kill...
What?
Nothing. How's your hand?
About the same. Thanks for asking...Damn blender. Okay, I can't stand it anymore, I'm dying to know--Did you try on some whiskers last night and hit a 7-11 along with all those other women? You had to have thought about it--a Catwoman for a night?
Like you don't know...
I'm having a hard time picking up your signal this morning--What did you say?
I said I saw you last night. What were you doing hiding in that alley, running off when the superhero alarm sounded...
I was doing my job. At the risk of sounding egotistical, I didn't become the best reporter in the world sitting by the phone. I was chasing tail all night--I was not spying, intentionally, on your hot and heavy date with "Brock Leviathan, architect." I can't believe he ordered white wine. You do know white wine is not real wine...
I'm afraid last night was the last straw of our city's tourists. The Mayor, in his finite wisdom, is throwing a "Month of the Woman" luncheon ball for the public this afternoon to try and calm everyone down. I thought maybe you and I could...
Go together? Sure, why not? Another date with someone who could be an insane messenger of death for all I know. No offense. Hey, lean over, let me smell your breath..Say in a deep voice, "A superhero's job is to protect..."
I give up. I give up.--I can't figure you out. Not gonna try.
You can't figure me out. You're the strange one..
You are...
Hey, architect--she's joking. Right, Selina? Selina?
Some reporter I am..all this time my story is right there in front..I have a lot of questions.
Lose the smile, Mr. Good Reflexes. We were having a pretty okay time the other night--good food, good conversation--some Catwomen show up and it's "You need cab fare?; I got to go to my Hideout--Oh, I'm sorry, I mean "warehouse."
Not too cool...
You know, now that I hear myself tell it, I'm thinking maybe both of you are messing with me. What, you get the Helmet Monday through Thursday, then Brock takes it for the weekend...
Have you seen the Oasisburg Police? They drive golf carts with little red sirens.
We have to do something. What can we do to help, Selina?
I'm sorry, ma'am, there are no pets allowed in the library...
But I'm blind.
It's seeing-eye dogs, ma'am. If I let the cat stay, will you go out with me?
What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again?
Okay, deal.
You're late.
A hearty breakfast is the start of a great morning...
Oh, I forgot to tell you, you're on a diet...The fact you're still reasonably pretty is the one thing you got going for you.
Oh Mommy, you're embarrassing me.
Is every single thing out of your mouth since your "accident" have to be a monotone mumble of cheap sarcasm?
Maybe.
It's funny, I've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. And I've heard of foregoing a career to start a family-- but I think you're onto something new, Selina. "Absolutely nothing"-- Has a ring to it. I think it could catch on...How's that for sarcasm?
I'll take your abuse, but it's way too early for the sanctimonious Cult of Gag...
Don't sneak up on me...
Uh, it's just--that woman out there-- that horrible Hag. She's the one who keeps following me on her creepy little scooter--And now she's built a hut in the back..Why did you...
Where were you last night? I didn't hear you come in.
Mom? Oh Mom, I messed up...
What kind of name is "Brock Leviathan?"
I never thanked you..the arrow..the motorcycle..the computer disc..You're so different from what I..and so the same.
They're going to attack Frank's Fun Palace!
I hate it when you let your hair just hang like that...you have such pretty eyes...
Mom, not now! I, I don't know what to do..
Yes, you do. You have to go rescue all those people...
But I'm not a hero. I'm nobody's heroine..I'm nothing. You've said so yourself many times.
Do you always listen to what your mother says? Selina. Something you choose your life. Sometimes your life chooses you. Save the day..
I don't know if I can do it alone.
What's a powerful man like you standing all alone for? Dance with me?
I'm sorry, Miss, one of us needs to keep surveillance...
What's it like being a superhero? It must be frightfully exciting..How did you guys all get together?
You seem sad, Spooky.
I'm not sad, no, I owe the Captain my life. It's just you think you want to help prevent crime, but you realize that's too complicated. It's a lot more fun to punish crime. Then after a while, you don't care what's a crime and what's not, what you became a Warrior for. You just want the kicks. The rush.
You're the One. I thought I told you to stay hidden behind the couch, CAT! You've torn the unit apart. You've driven a great leader insane...
Nice breasts.
Hey Buddy! Can you let me pull over? Give me some space to pull over.
Where do you think you're going?
Any place.
This is one way.
I know. But it's an emergency. Somebody dying. Okay?
I don't see anybody in there but you.
Was someone in an accident?
I'm sorry for whatever's happened to you but we're definitely not the right people to do you any good.
Don't you have children?
What are you doing on Theo's line?
Taking messages.
He ran out on me to be with you? Well fuck him! Everything worked twice as good without him. We didn't need him then and I don't need him now.
I'm sure he'll be heartbroken.
I know he's there! He doesn't even have the balls to pick up the phone!
Be careful. There were people in that crosswalk.
Have you got to tell her your life story?
This is my conversation. I'll say what I fucking please.
What if they do question the authenticity?
Oh. Seems yours girlfriend is casting doubts on your expertise.
I am not! Fuck you! Theo's a genius.
Who's on the phone?
What was that for?
You could've made me lose my call.
So what? What could be important enough to put your hands on me?
I didn't hurt you.
Say something ...
Me, he won't stay on the phone with for five fucking minutes without bitching.
I'm trying to help somebody. Okay?
He's at it again. Like that night at the Emerald. This piece of Euro-trash is slapping shit out of his little wife in a back booth -- so Mr. Good Deed here has got to step in and pound the fucker's head into the wall. Meantime "Wifey" recovers enough to pull off her high heel and nearly take our hero's eye out. It took
I know where it is. Give me that phone back.
I'm not finished. Under other circumstances I'd gladly go out of my way. I don't understand why you just don't phone some other person.
She can't! It's busted. Now hand that on back!
Theo wants to talk again.
Will you two cut it out?
He's right, Theo. She might not be around to back up your story. You could end up in the middle of this.
I know you feel awful but it's not your responsibility.
Then whose is it?
You gotta just look the other way.
Are you guys all right?
You could've killed us.
It was the fugitive in the Chrysler that caused this. We were trying to overtake him.
No reason to kill innocent bystanders. Shit. I can't hardly move my neck.
We've already got an ambulance on the way. Don't try to get out.
Now that'd be a misdemeanor.
I got to get going. An agent is showing me a house up on Broad Beach in ten minutes.
What'd you do? Tail me from Brentwood?
Let's have your license, mister.
What's this?
Lady, don't let him do it!
You got it wrong. I'm the one that's on your side.
Nels reporting in. Sit down where you are. Arms folded.
In case you crapped out it was my job to go after that briefcase.
Or relieve me of it later.
You missed.
How do we get back to the freeway?
Yeah, I suppose getting whacked has got to be one of your best ways to die. Particularly if you're not expecting it. You don't know what hit you.
Can you make him stop!
Which is why we had a lot more to worry about than the law. These are people who don't worry about reading you your rights.
I told you I should've cuffed him.
He's seen both of us now.
Look, I've got a wife. I don't care if either of you ever get caught.
It took you long enough to get my ass out.
With all those holes Nels pumped in I knew you wouldn't suffocate.
I prefer to have the sucker die at a more convenient location. Once Nels arrives with his backpack full of goodies.
Now turn around. I'm going to cuff you.
Put those away. We can't have marks on his wrists.
You never miss a trick.
You switched license plates?
It's taken care of.
We have never worked a gig together but I am a firm believer in preparation. So let's go over this again step by step.
That was definitely out of line and totally unprovoked. I heard you were a hitter.
Bullshit.
That's your "rep."
What do you mean tip the cops? Is the man a lunatic or what?
Just hand up on the bitch! Fuck you, madam. And goodbye!
I don't like anybody laying their hands on me.
Just like they say; no fucking self control.
If you know that just back off.
Shit. There's the hotel. You overshot the driveway.
And stop with the directions.
Make a "U" and go back.
That's illegal. You want us pulled over? I'll turn around at the corner if you'll shut the fuck up.
We still gotta run the drill before we walk in that lobby.
Go ahead then. I'm covering the receiver. She can't hear.
First off, this Mr. Chow Yen doesn't speak a lot of English. The girl with him will interpret. There will be a third person to accompany you into the men's room where you can take count. I hope you know Krugerands better than they know a <u>Hockney</u>.
I improved on the fucking original.
Let's hope so. Once you come out and okay everything I'll give Caitlin the sign that she can bring the painting on over.
Got your badge?
Satisfied, Wiseass?
In any event, whatever occurs you do not belt anybody.
Okay, okay, Lenore, calm down. Either let me call the school or better yet, the F.B.I.
I thought you said you could handle him.
Nels, don't let that cop pass you.
Lose the hardware now.
Don't fuck around. Pop a cap in him.
He took it like a man. Toss him in that drainage ditch.
Nels?
I'm still in my cab -- jammed up in traffic. Are you there yet?
Any minute.
I was worried about you. Both of you.
We've had our share of fuck-ups but it's going to work out fine.
Do I know you?
I've been trying to get someone -- anyone. For hours ...
If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --
You don't understand.
No. <u>You</u> don't understand! You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates. And I've got no time to screw around.
Will you let me explain!
And what're you whispering for?
Lady, try making some sense.
You may be our only chance. I don't know if I can do this again.
What'd you do! Just pick my number out of the air?
They smashed the phone. I've been clicking the loose wires together hoping it'd make a connection.
Who smashed the phone?
They're holding my husband downstairs.
Sure. And they left you upstairs to make phone calls?
They gave me pills to make me sleep. They didn't realize how much Seconal I'm used to -- that I'd have so much tolerance --
Well I'm not tolerant of being bothered with this bullshit story when I'm about to make the most important score of my life. This has gotta be some "put-on," right?
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry to do this to you.
You're not doing anything to me -- because -- listen to this carefully -- I do not care.
I don't believe you.
You're the one who's not to be believed.
My name is --
I don't want to know --
My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
I realize you don't want to be involved.
I am not involved. Keep clicking your little wires. You'll get someone else. Good luck.
You won't disconnect.
Oh won't I?
Because you know you'll be killing us.
Don't lay this on me!
Why would anybody want to hurt you?
They tortured my husband. Made him give them the pin numbers of our accounts. Once they get what's in the safe deposit box they'll kill us.
Where'd they take you to?
I have no idea. They put us in the back of a van with blacked out windows. The shutters up here are nailed shut.
Well isn't there a number on the goddam phone?
Okay. The police are gonna need your full name and address.
No! No police. They'll know right away the authorities are looking for us. They'll kill us. We've seen their faces.
The cops could trace this call back to you.
One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
What makes you say that?
He pulled us over as we left the Riviera Tennis Club. Claimed we'd run a stop sign. And when Elliot was reaching for his license --
Who?
Elliot -- our driver. The officer put his gun to the back of Elliot's head and -- fired. It was so quick.
Oh man. These people mean business.
Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it.
No don't. You could lose me for good. Don't go through that tunnel.
I'm in traffic. There's no place to turn.
Please.
Fine, no tunnel. Are you still with me? Hello?
I hear them coming upstairs. I won't be able to talk for awhile. I have to lay the phone down and pretend to be asleep. So don't talk. Don't say a word or they'll hear it.
I'm fine. She's back on. Hello? I'm here.
They just walked out. The smaller man -- he must be Dominican or Haitian -- he kicked me so hard. I felt a rib crack but I never made a sound. It's starting to hurt now -- real bad. A throbbing. I can't even take a deep breath.
I'm with two friends now.
Rachel! They're going after Rachel now -- and I can't stop them.
Stop throwing names at me.
Rachel, my daughter. She's an honor student at Parker. My God, she's only nine.
What do they need her for?
They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.
The bigger man is driving our Mercedes to the school. Rachel will recognize the car. She'll get right in.
Let me call the school -- tell them not to let her go.
He's right. You'll get my whole family killed.
"Theo?"
Forget who I am. Where's this school located?
26th off Wilshire.
Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me.
Why isn't anyone answering me?
Will you please speak to me! Theo?
Hello? It's just me and you again.
What about the others?
I kind of dropped them off. They were getting on my nerves.
What are you doing now?
What do you think I'm doing? I'm on my way to the school like you wanted.
Forget about us. Just save Rachel.
Tell me what she looks like.
They say she resembles me -- dark hair, ponytail, very dark eyes. They all wear the same uniform. Please. Be careful. The man driving the car must have a gun.
Where's the fucking recharger cord? Must be in her car, dammit.
How much time do you have left on it?
I don't know. 80 or 90 minutes, tops.
Why didn't you do what your friends wanted and just -- get rid of me?
I don't know. I hung up on somebody else a long time ago, and later on I wished I hadn't of.
A woman?
Hey drop it, okay?
I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
It never healed. I called her a lying bitch and everything else and I hung up on her. "Click." You don't exist.
And that was the end of it?
I sure as hell got my wish. She doesn't exist. So maybe you reached the appropriate person after all.
I'm sorry if I caused you to lose your business deal.
What do you do for a living?
Sometimes I paint.
Our house always needs touching up.
Pictures.
I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.
I suppose if you're a struggling artist you need a patron.
Lady, you don't have to keep up a running commentary.
I'm afraid if I stop talking I'll lose you. Just name any reasonable amount and it's yours.
Shit, stop with the money! I never asked for a nickel. I was just doing this. And you have to fuck it up with a price tag.
I didn't mean to. It's just the way I am.
A price on everything.
I wasn't always like that. I don't think I was.
I'm about ten blocks from the school.
I have no right to ask for help. I've never thought of anybody but myself.
That makes two of us.
There are cables overhead. Hang on. It'll clear up.
Make a right. You can't miss it.
Lenore, I'm here. I'm getting out.
I can hear you again, clearly.
Does she have a red ribbon on that ponytail?
Does she wear glasses?
No.
What's happening?
She's gone --
Don't say anything. Don't alarm them. Just go!
He's copying down my license -- for all the good it'll do him.
It's not your fault, Theo. You tried.
I should've put them out of the car and come sooner!
You said they wanted to get into some particular safety deposit box?
The one in Brentwood.
What bank?
Wait just a minute. Our luck has changed.
What do you mean?
I'm not doing too well. What's the matter?
I heard someone pulling in behind the house. I heard Rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden. I don't know what they did to her.
Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.
Even if you found us -- what then?
I'm cutting across to Bundy to Brentwood. That bank is our best bet. If anybody shows up I could follow them.
Jack will negotiate with them. He'll identify the right key and give them the information they need to gain access and they'll let Rachel go.
Not a chance.
Don't say that.
Do you know what's in that box?
They'll recognize it's not your husband.
Jack was only at that branch once when he took the box years ago.
They've still got to be able to sign his name.
It's not hard to do. I do it all the time.
I'm pretty good at signatures myself.
Oh my God. I heard her scream again. What are they doing to her? Why can't I do anything to stop them?
You're doing what you can. Why's all this money stashed?
To hide it from the I.R.S.
How come everybody turns out to be a crook?
Don't talk. Don't talk!
What's going on?
The front door slammed. Someone went out. There's a different car starting.
I might still get there first. The lights are with me. How would I identify the guy who shows up at the bank?
If it's the tall man -- he had one of those hair transplants. Tufts, you know. It still hasn't grown fully in. The other one is from the islands. Braided hair -- very dark.
It won't be him.
Theo, I want you to know, you're probably the most decent man I've ever met.
Yeah, sure that's me. Ask anybody.
But I guess we haven't really met -- have we?
I've got a lot of respect for you too. For the way you feel about your family.
Jack hasn't loved me for years. And now I'm afraid she's turning out to be like him. So cold and distant. I've let him make her like that.
Why tell me this?
Because you're probably the last person I'll ever talk to.
You can't give up.
Did you jiggle the phone?
No.
Did you hear that click?
Yes -- I think so. Another crossed line?
Or somebody else there is listening in --
Downstairs. There must be an extension. Oh my God --
No. I hear them. They're coming upstairs. They know!
Yes? Yes?
Hi Lenore. It's me. I got you back. Courtesy of Star 69. Are you hurt?
They dragged me downstairs. I thought they were going to kill me.
Lucky for them they didn't.
What did you do?
I had a little encounter at the bank and our Mr. Transplant ended up under the wheels of a Chevy.
God, if he doesn't come back --
I'm in possession of the bag he was carrying. And I'm in a position to negotiate. What about your husband and your child?
Thank you. God bless you for helping us.
Are you okay?
They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
That's coming off. How about the girl?
She's awake but she hasn't spoken. I don't know what they did to her. I don't want to think about it.
Your husband?
He's in back. Lying face down. They haven't hurt him anymore -- but he was crying. I never heard Jack cry before --
You're all three of you in that van?
Yes.
Now you're going to do just what I tell you to. No discussion. No hesitation.
Yes sir.
Lenore -- you promised you'd follow instructions. We're almost there. Simply get out when they slide the van open and walk to me.
I'm not leaving my daughter behind. Not with them.
She's next. In two or three more minutes she'll be free.
I can't do it.
Don't start thinking about it. Is the tape off?
Yes.
Can you walk?
Yes. But I want Rachel to come with me.
They won't allow that. It's one at a time. And you have to be first.
Why can't it be her?
She's a child. She might panic. She doesn't know me. She might not come to me. She might just run.
All right. Now that you explain it I see that you're right.
Once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us.
Rachel -- Oh my God.
It's locked.
Rachel was terrified when I left her. I could see it in her eyes.
She'll be with you soon. They're pulling up. They'll realize I kept my part of the bargain.
She'll never be the same. None of us will.
Now I have -- it's a long story.
Why didn't you just shoot them?
Because a lot of people would've gotten killed. Probably all the wrong ones.
You're going to let them get away with this?
We've almost got your husband and your daughter out. So don't get any ideas.
They tortured us. And you're going to let them have all that money?
So far they're keeping their part of it.
They put their hands all over me.
For Christ sakes don't point it at me. We want to get Rachel out of there in one piece. I'm waiting for the girl. Her mother wants to talk to her.
He had a gun. I have it now.
Why are you telling him that. Are you crazy?
You're not Lenore Oberfeld.
There isn't any such person.
Whose money is this?
It belongs to the man you took it from. Or should I saw <u>stole</u> it from?
The guy with the transplant.
Jack Oberfeld in person. Did you kill him?
Damned if I know.
The video cameras will put you with him in the bank, and I'll bet there were enough witnesses.
At least one.
Plus they'll remember you going after his daughter at school.
You timed that beautifully.
They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday.
I got what I fucking deserved. I had it all. I could've kept going!
As they say -- no good deed goes unpunished.
And all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop --
I thought it was inspired.
Sit completely still with both hands on the wheel -- until they get here.
Why pick me to be your "mark?"
Nobody's easier to con than a con man.
Who's in back?
L.A.P.D.
Your friends are probably still on the line. Pick it up and say hello.
There's no way out for you. You have to deal with us.
Tell them I'm keeping what's left. I earned it. I probably killed some poor bastard for it.
He seems to think he's entitled to it all.
Not all. They already have a third. The question is how much of that are they willing to give to get you back?
You won't shoot me. That's not your style.
We might hit a bump and the gun might go off. Ever see that Tarantino movie -- where Travolta blew that guy away in the back seat -- purely by accident?
Do you have to point that?
Absolutely. And Topanga Canyon has a hell of a lot of potholes if I recall.
He seems to be headed for Topanga.
I'm not trying to lose them. Nor am I exceeding any speed limits.
The one thing you don't want is to attract the police.
Granted, the cops are not an alternative. Certainly not with one of their own still locked in my trunk.
I don't hear him moving around anymore.
Those shots your associates got off may not have done him too much good. That's on their head. All I did I was put him there.
A typical fuck-up.
What's that supposed to me?
I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
You, I would've noticed.
Oh no, you were too busy trying to keep some Croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend. She showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel.
You were at the Emerald that night?
Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.
I guess I ought to stop seeing woman as victims.
I think it was my tone of voice more than anything else that sold you. And when you thought I was being kicked around, I wish I could've seen your face.
Now you're starting to sound like a victim again.
You could've hit me.
Only in the leg or the thigh. You'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts.
You wouldn't --
Yes I would. Not kill you. But blow off a few toes, absolutely. I'm entitled to that as retribution. It'll help you to remember me in years to come -- every time you put on stockings. They must have prosthetic toes by now -- with little nails on them you can polish --
Stop talking like that!
I'm still okay.
Inform him the fee is seventy-five large for your return. All parts intact.
He wants 75 back.
Plus names, addresses and I.D. for the lot of you. We're in this together and I need to know who my partners are. In case I ever need to roll over on somebody.
Did you hear that?
It could be a fire. This is Malibu.
No, there's a police car way back there. See it, in the distance coming around the turn? The van is blocking it now.
What's Nels' number?
259-7881.
Do you think they'll walk away?
They'll have units blocking us up ahead.
That's why we're turning off onto a fire road.
What's happening?
I can't hear. Now there's a siren. They must be in an ambulance. What about the money? Nels?
Wonderful feeling of security knowing your adversaries are both crippled and unarmed.
Any idea where you're going?
I was sentenced to a youth camp out here when I was fourteen. We cleared some of these same roads.
They did some great job of reforming you.
That's where this Chicano correctional officer first taught me to slap paint on a canvas. I could copy any fucking thing he put in front of me.
Think you could do a picture of me?
Developer ran out of money years back. I'd hate to think about what's living in there.
Why are we stopping?
Who'd ever think, to look at you?
As a child I hated being told how sweet I looked. That angelic little face wasn't me at all. I had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image. Sometimes words were enough -- but I wasn't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously. I enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who
You've had a lot of fun with me today. What would you have done if I hadn't responded to your call?
Yeah, I was waiting for that suggestion.
Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.
What's really on your wicked little mind?
The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
That's a reasonable possibility.
He might've heard everything we said in the car.
What's your point?
We can't leave him to repeat anything.
Which one of us is elected to do the deed?
You're the man with the gun.
Naturally.
Naturally.
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
I'm going to cuff you and leave you in that house. It may take awhile but you'll be found after we're long gone.
That's not good enough.
I'm handling it.
Both hands on your lap.
Just sitting here listening to her voice does it to me all over again. No harm admitting I fell in love with the sound of you.
Some nice fantasy you all cooked up for me.
Took preparation.
Exactly who was this Oberfeld?
Know what else is in here?
Think about what's going to happen to your valuables when that trunk flies open at 75 miles per?
You won't live to see it.
It's going to be some fucking snowstorm.
Five ... six.
I picked the wrong number when I chose you ... didn't I?
Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.
I've got ... one last number for you, Theo ...
I don't want it.
My fence in San Francisco ... 305-4410. Maurice. Don't take less than a third on the face value of those bonds.
Sure, like I'm gonna take advice from you.
Thank God -- thank God I've got you.
Who is this?
Oh God -- Oh no -- Help me -- Don't let me -- Die.
Didn't we play this scene before?
Don't leave me here to die -- Theo, please -- you can't let me die --
Who are you working for?
I'm self employed. What kind of cut did the hairy one have?
Twenty percent.
Fine. I want half. Plus the release of the family.
You're making it too easy.
You got time on your side. Pretty soon they'll be missed and we'll have the law up our ass.
They saw you kill the driver.
You're up on your details, aren't you?
You can rely on them to keep quiet because this is undeclared money that could land Jack there in federal prison. He can't afford for you to get caught and have this briefcase appear as evidence.
You're walking away with a clear fifty percent and a guarantee nobody can afford to I.D. you.
There are no guarantees in this life.
Where do we meet?
It's a nice day. How about the beach?
Pass.
A large stretch of empty space with no place to hide. Temescal Canyon parking lot.
What time frame have you got in mind?
It should take me twenty minutes. Where are you coming from?
I want you all in one vehicle. Your van. If I see anybody else cruising around I'll keep going. No second chances. You can kill them and I'll keep what I've got.
Some loyalty.
There's no loyalty at the expense of my own ass.
Tell the lady to relax. Tell her I can't wait to meet her in person.
She's somewhat damaged in the shipping. But nothing makeup won't cover.
Got a phone in that van?
Sure.
Take my number. When you see me -- call me and I'll walk you through the exchange. It's 308-9962 -- Repeat it back.
308-9962.
Beats yelling our brains out across some parking lot.
You're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular.
I'm here. Where are you?
We don't see you.
I'm three quarters of the way up the lot behind the concession stand.
Stay there.
I don't want you within two hundred feet. Park down by the lifeguard station. Nobody gets out.
It's your call.
Fucking "A" it is! Any argument and I'm out of here.
Just relax.
I don't need to relax. The woman. Put her on.
You'll see her.
I don't want to see her later. I want to hear her <u>now</u>.
Satisfied?
You already tried to pull one little number on me -- and it didn't work.
I don't know what you mean.
I still don't see you.
We're waiting on you.
Then just wait. I'm counting this all out and deducting my share. While I'm at it you can be getting that tape off the lady. And her little girl.
It's in the process.
I make my end of the cash at 184,000. Now I'm trying to figure out the bonds. What the face value is.
You should've done all this before.
I'm not accepting criticism today. Now don't make me lose count. There's already a half million in this portfolio.
Her husband said there'd be one million eight. So nine hundred to you.
My pleasure --
Be careful in disposing of them. You'll have to discount 'em. You'll be lucky to clear a hundred and a quarter.
Thanks for the sound advice. Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here. Alone.
Negative.
You'll still have the girl and the husband.
And not a nickel.
Soon as Mrs. Oberfeld is in my car I'll toss out your first third. Then I'll back up 200 feet to behind the public restroom.
And then?
You pull up -- collect your first installment. Then you let the daughter go. When she reaches me, I'll dump out another third. Same action. I back up again -- you pull forward. Satisfy yourself it's there. Then we do it one last time. The final exchange. And we go our separate ways.
And they run straight to the cops who start looking for our van.
I'm opening the side door. She'll step out. But before she gets in your vehicle I want to see the first installment put down in plain view. If it isn't there I'm shooting her in the back.
Are you trying to panic the women?
That's how it is. You see her approaching you toss out installment one.
Stop the crying.
She's yours. What are we waiting on?
Count it.
Don't worry.
Seems like it.
Yeah. Why don't we?
What's he doing? Answer me!
Who am I talking to?
Call me "Nels."
Okay Nels, you can always keep what you've got and haul ass leaving the lovely lady for me to worry about. I'll bet she can be friendly when it's in her best interests.
If you're looking for a quickie all you've got to do is ask.
If he pulls me over he gets all the proceeds plus Lenore here.
And if you ditch us we get zilch.
You're going to have to see to it that both lanes of this road get blocked.
The fuck I will!
You researched me. You know where I live. She'll be waiting for you there along with your split.
There's two police cars now.
Tailgate me. I'll jam on the brakes. You go into a spin to avoid an accident and cut them off.
You want us to get ourselves killed?
From what I can see you're a pretty fair wheelman. There's a hairpin coming up -- that's the place for it. The cops'll plow right into you.
And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
Yeah?
I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.
Yeah?
Nels! Guess who? A friendly voice from beyond the grave.
Who's this?
I thought you'd know me by now.
What does it take to kill you?
I suppose you're in your taxi?
Why would she want me to think you were on ice?
Intelligent question, Nels. I believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity.
That bitch. What's keeping you from taking off?
I can see the benefit in that.
You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack.
Not without the name of the contact who can discount the bonds. I may need to pry that information out of her. What do you stand to gain?
In the hills above Sunset. Just below the Getty.
How far off are you?
Five minutes.
Where do I turn?
Take the Getty Center exit -- make a right onto Cisco. It'll be a narrow winding road. You can't miss the house. It's a mansion built back in '29 -- Spanish -- boarded up since the quake.
Have your cab wait at the foot of Cisco -- we'll ride up together.
And make ourselves a hell of a target.
We're gonna get there first.
How do you know?
Better haul ass if we're gonna be inside to greet them.
I've got a couple of spare pieces stashed under the floorboards.
Where's the backpack?
None of your business, but it's in the cab. That's all mine. When we take from them, we divide, eighty-twenty.
Probably as close to the Getty as I'll ever come. Unless you care to be my "patron," Nels. You wouldn't be the first successful thief to become a patron of the arts.
In your dreams.
Don't underestimate me. I've got original ideas of my own. Warhol got famous doing a soup can. What would you think of a cellular phone done in acrylics?
Somebody better tear this down before it falls down.
Who were you talking to?
Them. They won't be expecting us.
Brilliant -- unless they were close enough to see the cab pull away. In which case you just warned them.
I'm in awe.
Since when did you guys start changing tires?
Only you <u>don't</u> have a flat.
Seems not.
If you weren't going for a spare what were you doing?
Something was rattling around. Some loose tools.
Why are you picking on me for?
Was I picking on you? How come you pulled in back of this fruitstand?
Don't be afraid to say hello. Your friend with the recent transplant is in no condition to deliver that briefcase. So I've taken on the task.
Who are you?
Let me talk to the lady again.
There's no lady here.
If you've already killed her that's fine. I'll keep the bonds and the cash. We got nothing to discuss.
Hold on.
If her kid or her old man have been harmed we've also got nothing to talk about.
I already called for an ambulance.
You've got a <u>phone</u>?
Can I make a quick call?
Government business?
What kind of Treasury Dept. business is this?
Undercover.
I thought so.
The 405 is coming up.
Let's have your name and address. The government will want to send you a letter of commendation.
You sure know how to take a lot of punishment.
Scottish?
So can we consider you a regular, sir?
Is that good or bad?
So let's call this the usual.
It takes all types.
So who's he?
He's what she should run a mile from.
Then why doesn't she?
She wants me to tell you go fuck yourself.
You could always make it up to her.
How?
When a girl runs out like that, she generally wants to be followed.
She's not a girl, Col --
See that, Col?
See what, Dil?
He gave me a look.
Just cut his hair, you know.
Yeah?
What you think?
Saw that one.
What would you call it?
Now he can look.... Ask him does he like his hair, Col.
He agreed that he was.
What do you think his name is?
That's what he said. Jimmy.
He's still looking, Col.
Persistent.
Good thing in a man.
An excellent quality.
Maybe he wants something.
Ask him.
He's back, Col
Hi.
Don't want any of those looks, Col. They don't mean much.
Stop it, Dil --
You see that, Col?
Saw it, Dil.
Fuck it, is what I say.
Yeah. Fuck it, Dil.
Fuck off, Dave.
You fucking promised.
Did I?
Don't be like that --
Thank you.
Who the fuck is he?
Jimmy.
It's him, isn't it?
See, they get the wrong idea.
Cunt. Scrag-eyed dyke cunt.
He's going to take his foot off slowly, David. Then you're to go home, like a good boy. You hear me?
Hey, Stirling fucking Moss --
Sure, Dave --
Take your clothes.
Don't throw my clothes out the window!
Fuck off back to Essex!
Don't chuck my clothes out!
Look, I'm sorry.
Fuck off, Dave.
No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm sorry, didn't I?
It's not Pat. It's Jim.
Do you mean that?
Is that his tart? Does Pat have a tart?
She's not a tart.
No, of course not, she's a lady.
Do it on your own time, Paddy.
What?
If I was her I'd consider that an insult.
What's that supposed to mean?
How much did that frame cost, Mr. Franknum?
Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.
Sorry won't bring the bloody thing back, will it, Mr. Franknum?
Not in my experience.
I'm sure you do, Mr. Deveroux.
Someone recommend you?
In a way.
Who?
Guy I work with.
Doesn't the water get to your nails?
What's it to you?
You American?
No.
No.
Scottish?
How'd you guess?
The accent, I suppose.
And what's it like?
That should make her happy.
Who's she?
Tell her I'm very happy with it.
Jimmy.
Everybody wants something.
Not me.
You old-fashioned?
Hi.
What was that?
You all right?
Yes, thank you.
What was that all about?
He wants me to perform for him.
Perform?
You know.
You on the game?
He's getting up.
You want me to ask you in, right?
No, I didn't --
Now, if you asked me to meet you tomorrow, it would really drive him insane.
Where?
Give me that look again.
What look?
What's that about?
They're jealous.
Why?
Now's the time you're meant to do something, isn't it?
Like what?
Make a pass or something. Isn't that the way it goes?
You got a special friend, Jimmy?
How special?
Jesus Christ!
That Dave?
Piss off, Dave!
Tough guy, huh? Are you going to be all right on your own?
Would you like a drink?
Yes, please.
What'll it be?
Someone out there.
Sorry. How'd he drive with his neck in a brace?
Must be in love to manage that.
He lived here with you?
He was different.
How different?
As different as it's possible to be.
Tell me about him.
No.
Shouldn't I go?
No --
You want to know how I kissed him?
Yes...
Are you jealous of him?
Maybe.
What would he think?
Do you miss him?
What do you think?
I think you do.
You say that like a gentleman.
Do I?
But you can t stay, you know that?
Didn't think I could.
Shouldn't you be in mourning?
Did he come here too?
Is this an obsession of yours?
Maybe.
He did sometimes.
So what do you want with me, Jimmy?
Want to look after you.
What does that mean?
You mean that?
Why?
Drink.
What is this?
Can't leave me now.
Aha.
The thing is, can you go the distance?
Depends what it is.
What you thinking of, hon?
I'm thinking of your man.
Why?
I'm wondering why you keep his things.
Did he ever tell you you were beautiful?
Even now.
No...
Tell him to stop messing Dil around --
Dil --
Tell him it hurt --
Come on, Dil --
Never let the sun go down on an argument, Jody used to say.
What you doing here?
Got your note. So let's kiss and make up, hon.
Don't call me that.
Sorry, darling.
Give it over, Dil --
You're something else, Dil, you know that?
See, I was always best looking after someone. Must be something in the genes.
Must be.
You could?
Do you care, Jimmy?
Sure I do.
You mean that?
My, oh my, Jimmy, how gallant.
Shut up.
Made me feel all funny inside.
I said stop it.
Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.
You think that's wise?
I didn't mean to hit you.
Kind of liked you as a girl.
That's a start.
So I'm sorry.
Make it up to me, then.
How?
Ask to meet me again.
Will you meet me again?
When?
Do they know?
Know what, honey?
Know what I didn't know. And don't call me that.
Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her feelings.
Details, baby, details.
So they do know.
Don't.
Sorry.
I should have known, shouldn't I?
Probably.
Kind of wish I didn't.
You can always pretend.
That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't he?
Absolutely.
Won't be quite the same though, will it?
Are you pretending yet?
There's Dave. He knew too.
Am I becoming repetitious?
A little.
Don't ask me in.
Please, Jimmy.
No. Can't pretend that much.
I miss you, Jimmy.
Should have stayed a girl.
Don't be cruel.
Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.
Happy now?
What?
He'd bring me carnations.
So I got it wrong, then.
Not at all, honey.
Don't.
Come on.
Why, honey --
Come on.
You gonna tell me why?
What's wrong, Jimmy? Tell me what's wrong --
Dil, this is Jude.
It's her, isn't it?
What's her?
She's the thing you had to tell me.
Kind of.
Shouldn't be, Dil
She own you, Jimmy?
Yes.
She from Scotland too?
You could say that.
And you're not going to tell me more?
What you doing, Jimmy?
I'm not sure.
Do you like me even a little bit?
You do something for me, Dil?
Anything.
You'd do anything for me?
Afraid so.
You want another haircut, baby?
You said anything, Dil
A girl has to draw the line somewhere --
Why?
It's a secret.
You'd like me better that way, Jimmy?
Yes.
And you wouldn't leave me?
No.
You promise?
You're no good at this, Jimmy.
You want to make me look like him...
So it's true, then?
What?
You like me better like this.
Don't call me that --
Why?
For me.
Why are we going here, Jimmy?
Dil! Dil! What the fuck are you doing here?
I'm going home!
Told you to stay in the hotel!
I had to go to work!
Come on...
So tell me.
I was trying to get out of something.
You got to forget you ever saw me, Dil.
You mean that?
You heard what I said, Dil?
What pills?
Prescription. For my condition.
Are you supposed to take that many?
Are you all right, Dil?
Good-bye, Dil
Jimmy?
What?
Dil Can I tell you something? I knew your man.
You knew which man?
Your soldier.
Lifted him from a carnival in Belfast. Held him hostage for three days.
You knew my Jody?
Yes.
I got the order to shoot him. Before I could do it he ran. Ran into a tank and died.
Died...
You killed my Jody?
