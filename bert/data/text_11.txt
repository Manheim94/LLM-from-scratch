In a manner of speaking.
You killed my Jody
No.
You didn't.
I suppose I tried.
You tried.
Don't leave me tonight. Might kill me, too.
Wondered why you came on to me like that when you gave me the look.
See, I fix on anyone that's nice to me. Just the littlest bit nice and I'm yours.
Stop it, Dil --
See, I should blow you away, Jimmy. But I can't do that. Yet.
Why?
Got to be somewhere.
Let me go for fuck's sake, Dil -- or they'll be here
You like me now, Jimmy?
I like you, Dil --
Give me a bit more, baby, a bit more.
More endearments.
I like you, DIl
Love me.
Yes.
Tell me you love me.
Whatever you say, Dil.
Then say it.
Love you, Dil.
You do?
Yeah.
What would you do for me?
Say it again.
And you'll never leave me?
Never.
What was that she called you, Jimmy?
What's Fergus?
It's my name, Dil --
Dil!!!
She was --
And she used her tits and that cute little ass to get him, didn't she?
Yes.
Tell me what she wore.
You've got to go now, Dil --
Do I?
Yes. Now.
Am I in trouble, Jimmy?
Not if you go.
Will I see you again?
Promise?
I promise.
Where am I to go, Jimmy?
The Metro.
Meet Col --
Got you the multivitamins and the iron tablets, hon --
Sorry, love. Now, the white ones are magnesium supplement --
Stop it, Dil --
I've got to keep you healthy, Jimmy. I'm counting the days. Two thousand three hundred and thirty-four left.
Thirty-five.
I'm sorry, darling. I keep forgetting the leap year. What am I supposed to call you then, Jimmy?
Fergus.
Fergus. Fergus my love, light of my life - -
Please, Dil --
Can't help it. You're doing time for me. No greater love, as the man says. Wish you'd tell me why.
As the man said, it's in my nature.
Lucky you.
What was it?
You know her, Jimmy?
Yeah. Just checking. He being nice to you, Dil?
Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?
That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as they say.
Don't go looking for it, Dil.
Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.
A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she, Jimmy?
A girl has to have a bit of glamour.
Fergus!
You'll notice I've asked you nothing.
That's wise, Tommy.
So what do you need, Fergus?
Need to go across the water.
Do you now.
Need to lose myself awhile.
See does he want some.
Hey -- what's he like?
Horny bastard.
Did you give him it?
There are certain things I wouldn't do for my country.
Have a look at him.
Can't.
Poke him or something. See if he's still alive.
He's all right.
You don't know that.
Tough work, that.
Leave us, Judie.
Put that thing back on him, Fergus.
He's hot.
What was it, Fergus? Did you blow the gaff on us or did you just fuck up?
Leave me alone, Jude.
No. That's the last thing I'll do. You never asked what happened.
I heard.
Eddie and Tinker died.
I know.
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
We had a court-martial in your absence. They wanted to put a bullet in your head. I pleaded for clemency. Said we should find out what happened first. So what did happen?
He ran. I couldn't shoot him in the back. I tried to catch him. He made it to the road and got hit by a Saracen.
So you did fuck up.
Yes.
But you know what the thing is, Fergus?
No, what is the thing?
You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.
What do you mean?
We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them.
No way, Jude. I'm out.
Leave her out of this.
She's nobody. She likes me.
But, then, I don't have a choice.
Och, you do, Fergie.
Of course. I forgot.
And then you'll leave her out of it?
And what if I say no?
You were made for this.
Was I?
Perfect.
And what happens then?
We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do.
And what if you don't?
Fergus, I think you don't trust me.
You may be right.
Jude?
Yes?
Who's the old geezer?
You a handyman, Fergie?
I take pride in my work.
Dil!
Give him a cup of tea.
Made the front page. They'll move now, the fuckers.
Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
Why would you do that?
The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.
So?
And anyway, he's seen our faces.
You sure?
You're his keeper. If you don't mind him seeing you, I don't mind. But you're the only one he looks at.
Thanks.
What the fuck is this?
It's nothing. He's just got a sense of humor, that's all.
So he knows your name?
I told him.
Back in a minute, Jody
You'll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me?
Yes.
And do you know why?
Why?
You OK about that?
I'm a volunteer, am n't I?
Shut up, Jude. You best get some sleep tonight, Fergus.
Peter.
What?
Why do you want to do that for?
Would make me feel better about it.
You sure about that?
I'm sure.
So it was you all the time.
Who'd you think it was?
I thought it was Dave.
And who's Dave when he's at home?
He's at home.
Should blow you away, you know that?
I'm getting emotional. And I don't want to get fucking emotional -- you understand, Hennessy?
I understand.
And what's she like between the sheets?
Definitely unusual.
And who is she?
Just a girl.
And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?
Aye, I do, Peter.
So what do you think that is, Hennessy?
A hotel?
Who is he?
Thank God for that.
You being cynical, Hennessy?
Hope not.
Good. So what do you think?
Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men are any good. And I presume you can't get in.
Right.
So it's on the street.
Right.
Fuck you.
Eat something, would you?
Can't.
What do you mean you can't?
This is a farce, man.
How is it a farce?
I seen your fucking face.
So, what do I look like?
You're the one about five ten with the killer smile and the baby face.
Am I?
Thank you, handsome.
How did you know it was her?
Please, man, I'm suffocating in here.
Now, if you took the ropes off, I'd be able to feed myself.
No fucking way.
What's that?
Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup.
No?
Nope. Not handsome at all.
You trying to hurt my feelings?
No. It's the truth.
Well, I could say the same about you.
Could you?
But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.
Hey --
What is it now?
You're going to have to do it, aren't you?
Do what?
What makes you think that?
They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.
They won't let him die.
You want to bet?
I'm not a gambling man.
And even if he doesn't die -- you can't just let me loose.
Why can't we?
Not in your nature.
What do you know about my nature?
I'm talking about your people, not you.
What the fuck do you know about my people?
Only that you're all tough undeluded motherfuckers. And that it's not in your nature to let me go.
Shut the fuck up, would you?
And you know the funny thing?
No, what's the funny thing?
Didn't look like that to me...
C'mere.
No.
Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.
What?
She'd be anyone's type.
Don't you think of it, fucker.
Why not?
She's mine. Anyway, she wouldn't suit you.
No?
Absolutely not.
She your wife?
You make a nice couple.
Don't I know it.
So what were you fucking around for, then?
You fuckers set me up. That bitch --
She's a friend of mine
Okay. That nice lady. Meets me in a bar. I'm saying what the fuck am I doing here anyway. She buys me a drink. She holds my hand. I'm looking at her saying I don't like you, bitch. But what the fuck. Maybe I'll get to understand.
What the fuck am I doing here.
What the fuck were you doing here?
I got sent.
You could have said no.
Can't. Once I signed up.
Why did you sign up?
It was a job. So I get sent to the only place in the world they call you nigger to your face.
Shouldn't take it personally.
"Go back to your banana tree, nigger." No use telling them I came from Tottenham.
And you play cricket?.
Best game in the world.
Ever see hurling?
That game where a bunch of paddies whack sticks at each other?
Best game in the world.
Never.
Well, in Antigua cricket's the black man's game. The kids play it from the age of two. My daddy had me throwing googlies from the age of five. Then we moved to Tottenham and it was something different.
How different?
So when you come to shoot me, Paddy, remember, you're getting rid of a shit- hot bowler.
Nice to meet you, Fergus.
Take it easy, now. Just go slow. Down by that tree.
Can't.
Now, that was worth waiting for.
Hurry up, would you?
Now put it back in.
Thank you. I had a case of the clap two years ago. Crabs in Ulster. But all in all it's served me well.
Shut up, would you?
Fergus?
Yeah?
So what's that supposed to mean?
Means what it says. The scorpion does what is in his nature. Take off the hood, man.
Why?
See? I was right about you.
Don't be so sure.
Where would you most like to be now, man?
Doesn't matter where.
Come on, man. If this shit was all over.
Having a pint in the Rock.
You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.
Like what?
Having two pints in the Rock.
Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's having a margarita.
Who's Dil?
My special friend.
Oh, yeah.
We got simple tastes, you and me.
The best.
But you fellas never get a break, do you?
Do you?
Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you?
We don't look on it like that.
I've often wondered how you do it.
Depends on what you believe in.
What do you believe in?
That you guys shouldn't be here.
It's as simple as that?
Is it bad?
No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?
I didn't.
She can't help it.
Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all.
You liked her?
Present tense, please. Love her. Whatever she is. I'm thinking of her now, Fergus. Will you think of her too?
Don't know her.
Want you to do something, Fergus.
What?
If they kill me --
Don't think that way.
See if she's all right.
I don't know her.
Take the whole lot. I won't need it.
I told you not to talk that way --
Go to Millie's Hair Salon in Spitalfields. Take her to the Metro for a margarita. Don't have to tell her who you are. Just tell her Jody was thinking --
Don't.
Help me.
How can I?
Go to sleep now.
I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.
What?
A story.
Like the one about the frog?
And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.
When I was a child...
Yeah?
I thought as a child. But when I became a man I put away childish things...
Nothing.
Not a lot of use, are you, Fergus?
Take the hood off, Fergus --
I'm glad you're doing it, do you know that, Fergus?
Why?
Cause you're my friend. And I want you to go to the Metro --
Stop that talk now --
Hurling's a fast game, isn't it, Fergus?
The fastest.
Faster than cricket?
Cricket's in the halfpenny place.
So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat you, is there?
You won't run.
You stupid bastard --
What you say, faster?
I said you bastard -- stop --
Used to run the mile, you know -- four times round the cricket pitch -- what was that game called?
Hurling --
What?
The teddy bear?
Don't run off, Jude.
What if I did?
Never pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude.
You didn't?
And you know what?
Not here.
Who gives a fuck.
I never know nothing.
Come and get me, soldier --
See, if we took the hood off, we'd have to shoot you. As it is, you've got a fifty-fifty chance.
Thought you liked me, bitch.
It was fun while it lasted.
Have you no feelings, woman?
You're heading for trouble, Fergus --
I said shut the fuck up --
You're crazy. Don't let him, Peter.
Leave him alone, Peter. He's in love.
That fucker's dead --
Give me the shooter, Jude --
You're crazy --
Now Dyle, you listen to me -- my mama didn't raise no stupid children. I know who's got the money 'n I ain't disappearing till I got my share -- 'n' my share's growin' a whole lot bigger ev'ry day.
Where are you, ol' buddy?
All right -- where's the letter?
The letter? The letter ain't worth nuthin'.
You know what I mean -- the envelope with the stamps. I want it.
You greenhorn -- you half-witted, thick-skulled, hare-brained, greenhorn! They wuz both too smart for us!
What are you talking about?
Oh, come on!
-- there has to be a darn good reason for living the way you do. I want to know what it is.
It's simple. I like what I do -- I enjoy doing it. There aren't many men who love their work as much as I do. Look around some time.
Is there a Mrs. Canfield?
I could eat a horse.
I think that's what you ordered.
Don't you dare to be civil with me! All this time you were leading me on --
How was I leading you on?
All that marvelous rejection -- you knew I couldn't resist it. Now it turns out you were only interested in the money.
That's right.
Oh!
What would you like me to say -- that a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me than a quarter of a million dollars?
No -- I guess not.
It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.
What?
Oh, you should see your face.
What about it?
What's the matter?
Adam!
You don't look so bad in this light.
Why do you think I brought you here?
I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out.
Pretty good, huh? I taught them everything they do.
Oh? Did they do that sort of thing way back in your day?
Aren't you allowed to kiss back?
When you come on, you really come on.
I know why you're not taken -- no one can catch up with you.
That wraps it up -- Tex has the money. Go back to bed -- I'll let you know when I've found him.
You're going to look for him -- now?
If the police find him first they're not very likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us, are they?
Adam --
What is it?
I think we were wrong about Tex having the money.
Why?
I just heard from him -- he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him -- so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got it.
I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --
Where's that airlines bag?
Lord, you're stubborn.
But everyone and his Aunt Lilian's been through that bag. Somebody would have seen it.
Let's look anyway.
Lord, you're stubborn.
Electric razor -- comb -- steamship ticket -- fountain pen -- four passports -- toothbrush -- wallet -- key -- what about that?
To the apartment -- it matches mine perfectly.
It still doesn't make sense, but it isn't worth any quarter of a million either. Have we forgotten anything?
Heroin -- peppermint-flavored heroin.
Well, I guess that's it -- dead end.
Go to bed. You've got to be at work in the morning. There's nothing more we can do tonight.
I love you, Adam.
Yes, you told me.
Reggie -- I think I've found -- are you on?
No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam?
You're right. I remember Grandpierre looking through it. But there was nothing in it -- at least, nothing that the police thought was very important.
Can you remember anything at all?
Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had -- on the day he was killed.
With whom? Where?
I think it only said where -- but I can't --
Think, Reggie, you've got to think -- it may be what we're looking for.
That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.
Of course there is!
There is? Well, I can't say I think very much of a silly law like that. Think, Reggie -- please think -- what was written in Charles' notebook?
as outlined in report number three- nine-stroke-five-two of the Western Hemisphere Conference held on March 22 -- no wait! It was last Thursday, five o'clock at the Jardin des Champs- Élysées! Adam -- that was it! The garden!
Now what?
Five o'clock -- Thursday -- the Garden -- it's got to be something around here.
But Charles' appointment was last week, not --
I know, but this is all we've got left.
Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.
It's hopeless -- I don't even know what we're looking for.
It's all right -- I don't think Tex does, either.
Tex? You mean he's here, too?
Reggie -- stop!
Why? So you can kill me too? Tex is dead, I've seen him! He said Dyle did it!
I'm not Dyle -- you know that!
But Tex didn't -- he still thought -- !
Reggie -- why won't you listen?
But I didn't kill anybody.
Reggie -- please believe me!
He's -- with the C.I.A. -- I've seen him at the Embassy.
Reggie -- listen to me!
You lied to me so many times --
Reggie -- trust me once more -- please.
Can I really believe you this time, Adam?
You didn't have to chase me so hard --
I'm sorry I thought you were the murderer, Adam -- how did I know that he was as big a liar as you are?
And that's all the gratitude I get for saving your hide.
The truth, now -- was it my hide -- or the stamps?
What a terrible thing to say. How could you even think that?
I said, tell me to go to the --
I heard you, I heard you.
Then say it.
Reggie -- listen to me --
Never mind -- I'll go by myself.
I'm sorry -- my secretary must have gone to lunch. You are -- ?
Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.
Dry-cleaningwise, things are all fouled up. I had a good man -- an excellent man on the Rue Ponthieu, but H.Q. asked us to use the plant here in the building -- to ease the gold outflow.
Mr. Bartholomew -- are you sure you know who I am?
Have some, please. I've got... ...liverwurst -- liverwurst -- chicken and -- liverwurst.
Do you know what C.I.A. is, Mrs. Lampert?
I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?
Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
You mean spies and things like that?
Only we call them agents.
We? You mean you're --?
Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert --
I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't think that you people were supposed to admit --
I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs --
Agent.
Yes -- That all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he's in business.
What's all this got to do with me, Mr. Bartholomew?
Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
To be more specific, he was wanted by this agency.
So that was it.
Yes. We knew him, of course, by his real name.
His -- real -- ?
Voss -- Charles Voss. All right, Mrs. Voss -- -- I'd like you to look at this photograph, please -- by the way, you saw this one, didn't you? Scott, Cathy, and Ham, Jr.
Very sweet.
Aren't they? Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and --
Stop calling me that! Lampert's the name on the marriage license.
Mrs. Lampert, I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger.
Danger? Why should I be in any danger?
You're Charles Voss's wife -- now that he's dead you're their only lead.
Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying to frighten me you're doing a really first-rate job!
Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance.
Gladly, only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me.
Oh, haven't I? The money -- Mrs. Lampert -- the money. The $250,000 Charles Voss received from the auction. Those three men want it, too -- they want it very badly.
But it's Charles's money, not theirs.
Oh, Mrs. Lampert! I'd love to see you try and convince them of that! Oh, dear.
Then whose is it? His or theirs?
Ours.
Oh, I see.
And I'm afraid we want it back.
But I don't have it.
That's impossible. You're the only one who could have it.
I believe you.
Thanks very much.
Oh, you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it.
Mr. Bartholomew -- if I had a quarter of a million dollars, believe me, I'd know it.
Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've got it.
You mean it's just lying around someplace -- all that cash?
Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim -- you look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite sure you'll find it.
But --
Here's where you're to call me -- day or night. It's a direct line to both my office and my apartment. Don't lose it, Mrs. Lampert -- and please don't tell anyone about coming to see me. It could prove fatal for them as well as yourself.
Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you?
We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.
Why not?
Because they're still here.
Oh.
I don't know who this Mr. Dyle is, but it's just possible we were wrong about who killed your husband.
You mean he might have -- Mr. Bartholomew, I'm catching the next plane out of here -- I'm not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me!
Where are you now -- can you meet me? Do you know Les Halles?
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Bartholomew?
Were you followed?
Yes, but I lost him. I really did it quite brilliantly. I'm beginning to think women make the best spies.
Agents.
He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew -- I saw it.
Who?
Dyle, or whatever his name is.
What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?
He's hardly my Mr. Dyle.
Describe him.
Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- rather thin -- in good physical shape, I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite handsome, really.
No.
No, what?
That's not Carson Dyle.
Carson?
There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs. Lampert -- that's Carson.
Mr. Bartholomew -- why didn't you tell me you knew about Dyle?
I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.
I suppose you're old enough to have heard of World War Two?
Barely, yes.
Café.
Gratinée, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.
Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
Go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 -- the French Underground --
Yes. The five men. They were, of course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money.
Steal it how?
By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked.
Have you any idea what these things cost over here?
Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then?
Carson was dying so they were forced to leave him. They finally got back to the base, made their report, and waited for the war to end. Only Charles couldn't wait quite as long as the others. He beat them back to the gold, took everything for himself and disappeared. It's taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all this time to catch up with him
But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them?
We know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together -- but we still have no proof.
But what has all this got to do with the C.I.O.?
C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back.
I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- tonight.
I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you.
Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country.
That's the spirit.
Oh, stop it. What do you want me to do?
We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle.
Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive.
No, Mrs. Lampert.
But no one actually saw him die.
No, Mrs. Lampert. His death is registered with the War Department in Washington.
Oh. Then who's this one?
I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out, don't you?
Me? Why me?
You're in an ideal position -- he trusts you. Besides, you said yourself, women make the best spies.
Yes -- ?
Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening.
Are you sure there's no mistake?
Just a minute, Mrs. Lampert -- you'd better give that to me slowly. Who's Adam?
The one who said he was Dyle's brother -- of course I'm sure -- Tex wrote the word 'Dyle' before he died. He's the murderer I tell you -- he's the only one left! You've got to do something!
Calm down, Mrs. Lampert -- please. Does he have the money?
No, I do -- it was the stamps on that letter Charles had with him on the train. They were in plain sight all the time, but no one ever bothered looking at the envelope.
The envelope -- imagine that. Mrs. Lampert, listen to me -- you're not safe as long as you've got these stamps. Go to the Embassy right away -- wait, I'd better meet you halfway -- it's quicker. Now, let's see -- do you know the center garden at the Palais Royal? -- yes, by the colonnade -- as soon as you can get there.
It's Charles!
Very good.
He looks so young -- when was this taken?
It's the man who came to the funeral yesterday -- I'm sure of it -- a tall man in a corduroy suit and string tie.
Does the name Tex Penthollow mean anything to you?
No.
Yes -- and he was there, too -- a little fatter now -- and less hair -- but it's the same one.
Do you know him, Mrs. Vo -- Mrs. Lampert? Leopold W. Gideon?
No.
That's a face you don't forget -- he was there too --
Herman Scobie. And you've never seen him before, either?
Well, of all the mean, rotten, contemptible, crooked --
Crooked? I should think you'd be glad to find out I wasn't crooked.
You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?
We're not allowed to tell. May I have the stamps, please?
Here -- Wait a minute -- how did Carson Dyle get an office in here, anyway?
When did you see him -- what time, I mean?
Around one.
The lunch hour. He probably worked it out in advance. He found an office that was usually left open and just moved in for the time you were here.
Then how do I know this is your office?
Mrs. Foster -- send a memo to Bartholomew at Security recommending that --
Bartholomew?
-- recommending that all Embassy offices be locked during the lunch hour.
Starting with his own.
Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.
What's your first name today?
Brian.
Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve me right if I got stuck with that one.
Who asked you to get stuck with any of them?
Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?
Yes.
But you're -- divorced?
No.
Oh.
My mother -- she lives in Detroit. Come on now -- give me those stamps.
Only if you can prove to me that you're really Brian Cruikshank.
How about if next week some time I put it on a marriage license -- that ought to --
Quit stalling -- I want to see some identification -- now!
I wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- I could go to jail.
You'd lie about anything.
Well, maybe we'd better forget about it, then.
You can't prove it, can you? You're still trying to -- marriage license! Did you say -- ?
I didn't say anything. Will you give me those stamps?
You did too say it -- I heard you. Oh, I love you Adam -- I mean Alex -- er, Peter -- Brian. I hope we have lots of boys -- we can name them all after you.
If you do anything funny, or try to talk to anyone, I'll kill you, Dyle -- here and now. Okay?
What now?
How long do you intend -- ?
Sorry about that.
Do I knock or something?
Keep going.
Very pretty. Now what?
I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money?
Is that why you dragged me all the way up here -- to ask me that? She has it -- you know that.
And I say maybe you both have it! One more time, Dyle -- where is it?
Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?
Back where?
And stop threatening that boy. He doesn't have the money. Mrs. Lampert doesn't either.
Then who does?
I don't know, Herman -- maybe you do.
Me?
That's a crock! If one of us did that he wouldn't hang around here waiting for the other two to wise up.
He's just tryin' to throw us off! They've got it, I tell you! Why don't we search their rooms?
Not my room!
We'd better exchange keys. Here's mine.
Good morning, Mr. Dyle.
Reggie?
It's the only name I've got. How about you?
No cat and mouse -- you've got me. What do you want to know?
Why you lied to me.
I had to -- for all I knew you could have been in on the whole thing.
Well, you know now, so please tell me who you are.
But you know my name -- it's Dyle.
Carson Dyle is dead.
Yes, he is. He was my brother.
Your --
The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans, but I think they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie -- and your husband -- because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. I'm trying to prove it. They think I'm working with them. But I'm
Didn't anyone ever tell you it's impolite to -- What happened?
I met a man with sharp nails.
Scobie?
I left him hanging around the American Express.
Listen -- all I really want is an estimate.
Does it hurt?
Are you really Carson Dyle's brother?
Would you like to see my passport?
Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?
Would you like to see where I was tattooed?
Sure.
Okay, I'll drive you around there some day. Ouch!
Ha ha. You could at least tell me what your first name is these days.
Alexander.
Is there a Mrs. Dyle?
Yes, but we're divorced.
I thought that was Peter Joshua.
I'm no easier to live with than he was.
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you the truth, but I had to find out your part in all this.
Alex -- how can you tell if someone is lying or not?
You can't.
There must be some way.
There's an old riddle about two tribes of Indians -- the Whitefeet always tell the truth and the Blackfeet always lie. So one day you meet an Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot, but which one is he?
Why couldn't you just look at his feet?
Because he's wearing moccasins.
Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.
Why not a lying Blackfoot?
Which one are you?
Whitefoot, of course.
I hope it turns out you're a Whitefoot, Alex -- I could be very happy hanging around the tepee.
Reggie -- listen to me --
Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow.
So was Juliet -- at fifteen.
I'm not fifteen.
Well, there's your trouble right there -- you're too old for me.
Why can't you be serious?
There, you said it.
Said what?
Serious. When a man gets to be my age that's the last word he ever wants to hear. I don't want to be serious -- and I especially don't want you to be.
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
Okay.
What are you doing?
Cutting it out.
Who told you to do that?
You did.
But I'm not through complaining yet.
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
The phone's ringing --
They've got Jean-Louis!
That sounds like their problem.
What day is it?
Tuesday.
Lord, I forgot all about it -- Sylvie works late Tuesday nights -- she always leaves him with me. They wouldn't do anything to a little boy, would they?
Hello, Herman, it was a happy landing, I see.
Come on -- let's get busy. Who gets your vote?
Scobie -- he's the one that objected.
He's all yours. I'll do Tex and Gideon. Take Jean-Louis with you -- and make sure you bolt the door from inside.
Reggie -- ? Did you find it?
Who do you think did it -- Gideon?
Maybe.
Or Tex?
Maybe.
I think Tex did it.
Why?
Because I really suspect Gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect.
Do women think it's feminine to be so illogical -- or can't they help it?
What's so illogical about that?
A) It's always the person you don't suspect; B) that means you think it's Tex because you really suspect Gideon; therefore C) if you think it's Tex, it has to be someone else -- Gideon.
Oh. I guess they just can't help it.
Who?
Women. You know, I can't help feeling rather sorry for Scobie. Wouldn't it be nice if we were like that?
What -- like Scobie?
I'd love some, thanks.
No sense messing up the streets.
Alex --
Hm?
I'm scared.
Don't worry, I'm not going to hit you.
Maybe somebody felt that four shares were too many --
What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex -- that means we're in his way, too.
Yes, I know.
First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie -- we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that?
What? Assassinate somebody?
Hurry up and change -- I'm starved.
Got you.
Did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?
Reggie -- open the door.
This is a ludicrous situation. There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower.
Then I suggest you call one of them.
What are you doing?
I usually sing a medley of old favorites when I bathe -- any requests?
Shut the door!
The suit needs it more than I do, anyway.
Every day. The manufacturer recommends it.
Reggie -- you haven't spoken a word in twenty minutes.
I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie -- and the one who's going to be next -- me?
Nothing's going to happen to you while I'm around -- I want you to believe that.
How can I believe it when you don't even know who the killer is? I've got that right, haven't I? You don't know who did it.
No -- not yet.
But then if we sit back and wait, the field should start narrowing down, shouldn't it? Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't you say so?
What do I have to do to satisfy you -- become the next victim?
It's a start, anyway.
I don't understand you at all -- one minute you're chasing me around the shower room and the next you're accusing me of murder.
I can explain if you'll just listen. Will you listen?
I can't very well leave without a pair of water wings.
Okay. Then get set for the story of my life -- not that it would ever make the best-seller list.
Fiction or non-fiction?
Why don't you shut up!
Well!
Are you going to listen?
Go on.
After I graduated college I was all set to go into my father business. Umbrella frames -- that's what he made. It was a sensible business, I suppose, but I didn't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible.
I suppose all this is leading somewhere?
It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.
What do you mean?
When a man has no profession except the one he loathes, what's left? I began looking for people with more money than they'd ever need -- including some they'd barely miss.
You mean, you're a thief?
Well, it isn't exactly the term I'd have chosen, but I suppose it captures the spirit of the thing.
I don't believe it.
Well, I can't really blame you -- not now.
But I do believe it -- that's what I don't believe. So it's goodbye Alexander Dyle -- Welcome home Peter Joshua.
Sorry, the name's Adam Canfield.
Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? I don't even know who I'm talking to any more.
The man's the same, even if the name isn't.
Monsieur Félix -- ?
I was expecting you. You are American too, of course.
Yes.
Have you ever, in your entire life, seen anything so beautiful?
I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps.
I know them as one knows his own face, even though I have never seen them. This yellow one -- a Swedish four shilling -- called 'De Gula Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854.
How much is it worth?
The money is unimportant.
I'm afraid it is important.
In your money, perhaps $65,000.
Do you mind if I sit down? What about the blue one?
It is called 'The Hawaiian Blue' and there are only seven left. In 1894 the owner of one was murdered by a rival collector who was obsessed to own it.
What's its value today?
In human life? In greed? In suffering?
In money.
Forty-five thousand.
Do you have anything to eat? And the orange one -- what about the orange one?
A two-penny Mauritius -- issued in 1856. Not so rare as the others -- $30,000 perhaps.
And the last one?
The best for the last -- le chef- d'oeuvre de la collection. The masterpiece. It is the most valuable stamp in the world. It is called 'The Gazette Guyanne.' It was printed by hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer. Today it has a value of $100,000. Eh, bien -- I am not a thief. I knew
You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return, Monsieur Félix -- are they for sale now?
Let me see. There are 350 European, 200 Asian, 175 American, 100 African and twelve Princess Grace commemorative -- which comes to nine francs fifty.
Please keep it.
I'm -- I'm sorry.
That was a dumb move, Herman -- a dumb move.
I suggest you get about your business -- nothing soothes Herman like success.
What for? If it's not here, why bother him?
And if it is?
You sure nuthin's missin'?
There sure ain't nothin' here worth no quarter of a million.
Not unless we're blind.
You think that mebbe we're fishin' the wrong stream?
Meaning what?
You don't s'pose one o' us has it, like the man said -- I mean, that'd be pretty distasteful -- us bein' vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all.
You know I'd tell you if I had it.
Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you.
What do you mean, no?
Mrs. Lampert --
What do you want?
Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
Tell me what?
It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- you do know that, don't you?
I don't know anything.
Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead.
Leave me alone -- !
Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --
I'm afraid that will have to wait, Mrs. Lampert.
But his mother --
Yes.
You loved him?
We discovered your husband's body lying next to the tracks of the Paris- Bourdeaux railroad line. He was dressed only in his pajamas. Do you know of any reason why he might have wished to leave France?
Leave?
Your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this morning at seven.
He was American?
Swiss.
Oh. Swiss. His profession?
He didn't have one.
He was a wealthy man?
I don't know. I suppose so.
About how wealthy would you say?
I don't know.
Where did he keep his money?
I don't know.
Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?
I don't know.
C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment absurde!
I know. I'm sorry.
Is it all right?
One wallet containing four thousand francs -- one agenda -- -- his last notation was made yesterday -- Thursday -- "Five p.m. -- Jardin des Champs- Elysées" Why there?
I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody.
Obviously. One ticket of passage to South America -- one letter, stamped but unsealed, addressed to you --
"My dear Regina: I hope you are enjoying your holiday. Megeve can be so lovely this time of year. The days pass very slowly and I hope to see you soon. As always, Charles. P.S. Your dentist called yesterday. Your appointment has been changed." Not very much, is it?
We took the liberty of calling your dentist -- we thought, perhaps, we would learn something.
Did you?
If you will sign this list you may take the things with you.
Is that all? Can I go now?
Of course it is.
I don't understand.
I was, too.
In Mr. Dyle's room?
No -- in my room.
Oh, la.
Yes, of course -- but if you went back and wrote me a letter --
-- you could have the stamps. I'll get you some here, okay?
Oh, la! If I find the treasure, will I win a prize?
Come on, now -- if you wanted to hide something, where would you put it?
I know. I would bury it in the garden.
Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
Oh. Neither do I. Voilà!
Voilà what?
I hope I don't find any little hairy things living up here -- wait! There is something! If I can just -- yes, I'm getting it -- a case of some sort -- it's heavy.
I found it! I found it!
If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy.
Up there! It is up there!
Jean-Louis -- thank heavens! Do you have -- ! What's that?
A man traded with me -- all those for only four.
But he is gone.
I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do you know where this Monsieur Félix lives?
Oh, forgive me. Is this yours?
It's hers. Where'd you find him, robbing a bank?
He was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild. We don't know each other, do we?
Why, do you think we're going to?
I don't know -- how would I know?
I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
Yes, of course. But you will let me know if anyone goes on the critical list
Quitter.
How's that?
Clever fellow -- almost missed me.
I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
Sorry. Which view would you like?
The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have -- I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name?
Peter Joshua.
I'm Regina Lampert.
Is there a Mr. Lampert?
Yes.
Good for you.
No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce.
Please, not on my account.
No, you see, I don't really love him.
Well, you're honest, anyway.
Yes, I am -- I'm compulsive about it -- dishonesty infuriates me. Like when you go into a drugstore.
I'm not sure I --
Well, you go in and you ask for some toothpaste -- the small size -- and the man brings you the large size. You tell him you wanted the small size but he says the large size is the small size. I always thought the large size was the largest size, but he says that the family size, the economy size and the giant
Oh. I guess.
Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
Yes, but we're divorced.
That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious.
Is your husband with you?
Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me. First it was separate rooms -- now we're trying it with cities. What do people call you -- Pete?
Mr. Joshua. Well, I've enjoyed talking with you.
Now you're angry.
No, I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today.
Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
Shakespeare never said that.
How do you know?
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?
Are you in the book?
Charles is.
What are you doing here?
I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.
How did you find out?
It's in all the afternoon papers. I'm very sorry.
I rang the bell but I don't think it's working.
Where did everything go?
Charles sold it all -- at auction.
Do you know what you're going to do?
Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose.
Doing what?
I'm a simultaneous translator -- like Sylvie, only she's English to French -- I'm French to English. That's what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him.
Instant divorce you mean?
Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.
Come on. You can't stay here.
I don't know where to go.
We'll find you a hotel.
Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore.
Hallo, Peter.
You telephoned me to meet you. I've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you.
What's going on?
Don't you understand French?
I'm still having trouble with English.
Of course? I thought he was dead.
Right there, between your eyes -- see? Worry lines. You're much too young and too pretty to have anything like that. How about making me vice- president in charge of cheering you up?
What was all that?
Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.
You mean you and me?
En garde.
What are you doing in here?
You haven't said a word since we left the club -- what happened back there?
I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.
I don't think I follow you.
He said if I told anybody it could prove fatal for them as well as me.
Who said?
That's what I'm not supposed to say.
Stop this nonsense! If you're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it.
Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me.
I wasn't --
You said this afternoon that your husband was mixed up in something.
How do you shave in there?
What was it?
What was what?
What your husband was mixed up in.
Look, I know it's asking you to stretch your imagination, but can't you pretend for a moment that I'm a woman and that you're a --
We're here.
Where?
On the street where you live.
Him: 'Do you mind if I come in for a nightcap, Reggie?' Her: 'Well -- it is awfully late.' Him: 'Just one, all right?' Her: 'Promise you'll behave yourself.' Him: 'Sorry, baby, I never make promises I can't keep.'
How would you like a spanking?
How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child.
Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble, I'd like to hear about it. Otherwise, it's late, I'm tired and I'm going home to bed.
Do you know what's wrong with you?
What?
Nothing. Good night.
Peter -- are you all right?
I think I sprained my pride. Where'd he go?
Lock the door and the window -- and don't let anyone in except me. I'll be back in a minute.
Be careful, Peter.
There was no trace of him. All right, Reggie -- suppose you tell me what this is all about.
There are three men -- he's one of them -- they think I have something that belongs to them.
What?
Go on.
That's all.
No, it isn't -- where's the money?
I don't know. Those men killed Charles to get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train.
So they think he left it with you.
No, they won't -- I won't let them.
Please help me, Peter -- you're the only one I can trust.
I'm so hungry I could faint. I've -- I've gotten your suit all wet.
That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.
Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
Who is it?
Yes -- that's right.
What'd he say?
He -- he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me.
I wouldn't take that too seriously.
I believe what he said.
They're only trying to scare you, that's all.
How do you know what they're doing?
I don't -- but as long as they think you have the money, or know where it is, or have it without knowing where it is, or don't even know you have it --
What are you talking about?
You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words.
Words can hurt very much.
Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the morning.
Don't put yourself out.
Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.
Yes, I'll remember. Good night.
Miz Lampert, ma'am...
Yes?
Charlie had no call to handling it this-a-way. He sure didn't. No siree.
Howdy, Miz Lampert.
You know what I want, Miz Lampert...
No -- no, I'm don't.
Stop that!
It belongs to me, Miz Lampert -- an' if you don't give it to me your life ain't gonna be worth the paper it's printed on. You savvy what I'm sayin', Miz Lampert?
Please stop -- please!
Can you give me one good reason why I should?
Isn't there something constructive he can do -- like start an avalanche?
Sylvie -- I'm getting a divorce.
Ça alors! From Charles?
He's the only husband I've got. I tried to make it work, I really have -- but --
But what?
But why do you want a divorce?
Because I don't love him.
With a rich husband and this year's clothes you will not find it difficult to make some new friends.
He knows everything.
It's not exactly what I'd call a large turn-out.
Didn't Charles have any friends?
Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow. If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't even have him.
Have you no idea who could have done it?
Do you know him?
I've never seen him before.
He must have known Charles pretty well.
How can you tell?
Who is it from?
What is it about?
I hope Jean-Louis understands about last night -- it's just not safe for him to be around me right now.
Don't be silly -- he would not do anything. He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.
Hold it -- Italy just finished. They're recognizing Great Britain.
Sylvie -- ? What are you doing here?
Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.
What's he up to?
He was so excited -- when he got the stamps you gave him this morning. He said he had never seen any like them.
I'm glad. But what's all this?
The stamp market, of course -- it is here every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean-Louis trades his --
Good Lord! The stamps! Where is he? Sylvie -- we've got to find him!
What's the matter, chérie?
Those stamps -- they're worth a fortune!
What?
I don't see him.
We took all the chances. The money belongs to us, not him!
Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor.
Yeah? What's that?
Shoot no, not after all these years.
Howdy, Miz Lampert.
This ain't no game, Miz Lampert.
Yeah?
I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you.
Why?
He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.
He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
I think I know how to restore your reputation.
You do?
Yeah. Chris BERRINGER WAS PARKED OUTSIDE THE WINDOW.
What I don't understand is why they asked Marliston if Rod was a virgin. They could have asked you Cindy.
I never fucked Rod.
If I'm so all-used-up Ben, why do you try to hook me up non-stop?
I think it's funny.
I'm not fucking you. Not for all your CDS.
You want me to die? I thought you and I were tight.
ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN?
WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress?
I get all your CDs.
Not my imports.
Ok not your imports. All your other CDS and your K2 snowboard.
That's an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting?
One more time.
I get the imports.
You aren't planning to tell these kids that 'virgin' was tattooed into both Stacy and Rod, are you?
No.
Good.
But I am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends.
Hi Jody.
Why'd you send for Lenny Marliston?
The kids adore him. They confide in him. His patchouli reeking rear might know if Stacy and Rod were really virgins. Why didn't you ask Jody that?
She's my daughter, Tom.
So?
So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
If I'd gone public with this yesterday Annette Michaels might be alive today.
Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about?
is there anything you do?
Focus on the present. You always want to change the past. Let's figure out what you are going to tell the parents today, not what you should told them yesterday.
I'm going to tell them everything I know. I'm calling a town meeting for eight p.m.
You tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands.
IT'S LISA SHERMAN. But she still looks like we're eighteen.
That's impossible.
I swear to God. It's her. She told Jody she was Kenny's 'AUNT LISA'. I'm getting this sickly feeling...
It's almost ten o'clock.
Daddy you scared me!
You're grounded Friday night!
Your curfew is 9:30 and you know it, little miss.
It won't happen again.
You said that two weeks ago.
Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends!
Hi honey.
I'm fine. I've just never had someone my age die before. It's so weird.
How well did you know Stacy and Rod?
I've been in the same class with Stacy for years but we weren't tight or anything.
Had either of them broken up with someone recently? Hurt someone?
No. Those two were together before Kenny and I started hanging out and that's over, what, God a year now.
I want you to head right home after school.
Hi honey.
What's wrong?
What do you mean?
Well, I assume you let him kiss you?
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further?
A little.
How much further?
Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS!
I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to.
Not much further.
Ok.
Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
No honey.
You are upset.
I'm not.
I thought you'd be pleased.
It was a she.
Are you sure?
You know her?
It can't be.
Who is she Daddy?
You were eavesdropping.
No I wasn't.
What did you hear?
Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn't say goodbye.
No!
What kind of a person wakes up in the morning and says to themselves, 'Think I'll nail a sixteen year old girl to a tree today'?
You found her?
There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going.
We need you here. I can bring her in.
As bizarre as it may sound, seems someone is planning to have a big party tonight.
No?
Should we close down any eruption?
Are you sure?
We're seeing all the signs in town.
What happened?
Is Jody still awake?
Well?
She's still a virgin.
Did you warn her?
What are you doing?
This will relax her.
Hello?
I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.
She's not here.
You know where I can find her?
St. Michael's.
She works at a church?
Of what?
A bullet to the right cerebellum.
She was murdered?
Can you describe her? How old was she?
I never met the woman. I'm just taking care of the place until they sell it.
Can you get inside?
I can.
I knew Lisa Sherman long ago. It's extremely important that I get inside and try to verify that it's the same woman who lived here.
Is there a picture of her somewhere?
No pictures. No mirrors. Was she a crazy woman when you knew her?
No.
Couldn't tell she going to off herself, huh?
No, you couldn't.
I've been in a lot of people's houses and this one's the creepiest.
Really?
Yeah. You should check downstairs.
Why?
I know where you're going.
Your brother told us.
Daddy....
Shh. I'm not going to tell you not to go.
You're not?
We just found another body.
Who's?
Tom Sisler. He was murdered at school. Two kids went into his office to fuck and they found him, with his tongue cut out and his foot jammed into his mouth. Killer also chopped off his pecker and stuffed it in his pencil holder.
Jesus. Any word from Brent?
Nope. The switchboard is lightning up downtown. Kids from other towns are starting to congregate in the parks and at the high school. It's turning into WOODSTOCK except there's no concert.
Call Brent on the horn. See where he is. What he wants us to do. I'll head over to the school.
But I shouldn't shut it down?
Pay no attention to me.
You fucked me up!
What?
You gave me a 'D'.
I'm sure you should have failed.
Please get out of my way or I'll have to hurt you.
I am.
My house is just a couple of blocks away. Why don't you come on over and clean those cuts up.
Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car?
Can you just follow me? The back is full?
You aren't going to the party?
of COURSE. You're not scared?
Of course I'm scared.
Then you should go.
You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston?
We're all manipulated. From the moment we're born. The event that fatalistically shaped my life happened before I was even born.
Really?
Me? Why me?
What do you know about my father?
_ Your father raped someone?
Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
Yes.
I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one.
You're the killed.
Please! You wouldn't kill your sister, would you?
Go sit next to him.
Who?
Mark Shale.
Why?
Don't you want to talk to him? You watch him eat everyday.
I don't watch him eat everyday.
The seat behind him is open. Come on, I can eavesdrop too.
You eventually have to talk to him.
No! That's his table.
What am I supposed to say? 'Nice sweater Mark'? 'Did you buy it at Eddie Bauer's?'
You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars.
You're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff.
You are 'sp fucking' wrong.
You get to be a little Chelsea Clinton. Everyone wants to meet you. Party with you. Have sex with you.
He's just trying to mess with your head. Ignore him.
Does she fuck?
Oh nice save.
I was desperate. It was gross.
Kenny'll come running back. This is just his way of pressuring you.
He says he loves me.
Personally I think he has a deep, almost pathological desire to corrupt you. But I suppose that's a type of love. I certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me.
Maybe I should blister through a bottle of Tequila and just fuck his brains out.
No!
You're the one always saying 'Just do it'.
I don't know what I'm so scared of.
Want to come in for awhile? Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men, head into a private S&M chat room . . .
How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.
I promised I'd go right home after school.
Sandy, you have to chill out, at least two-thirds of the kids in our class are still virgins. He can't butcher all of us.
Not that many.
You watch. There's going to be a hymen holocaust tomorrow. Maybe I'll finally talk to Mark Shale.
Someone tried to kill me.
You ok?
FINE. Are you?
Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what?
What?
Mark invited me to the party.
What party?
Shh. Ben's party. Tonight. Haven't you heard?
You can't tell your parents.
Ok.
Especially not your dad.
I won't.
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
Unless he makes a move during seventh period.
Didn't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time?
I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go.
Stag?
Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.
I can't right now.
Hi Jody. What can I DO for you?
Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep the old town papers?
They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for?
Twenty eight years ago.
This place is empty.
Everyone's getting ready for the party.
You heard about that?
Of course. NO ONE EVER SHUTS UP IN THE LIBARY. Kids were whispering about it all day.
Don't you think it's sick?
Not at all. In fact, I thought about going.
Unfortunately I qualify. Think I'm too old?
No.
Cut it out.
Why?
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
I got to get home.
You know, maybe we ought to start seeing other people.
What?
Are you O.K.?
I'm fine.
I heard you got attacked.
I did.
I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash?
Yeah. I think it's really sick.
Why?
Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party.
Nobody wants to be the fourth. Please go with me.
Did Sharon say no?
You know I want to go with you.
I'm so flattered but I can't. I'm grounded.
Everyone's grounded. There's a killer on the loose.
If you don't want to go with me just say so. Say 'Kenny, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU' but don't use your dad as an excuse. I'm so sick of it.
I'm not using him as an excuse.
Yes you are. You always do. It's why we broke up. You always hide behind him.
I do not.
I feel like I NEED YOU DAD'S permission just to kiss you. Jody, it's time to assert yourself To be a big girl. An individual. I'm going to this party tonight. Jimmy's my ride. Come over to my house after school. We'll go together.
I have to go home after school. I have something really important I have to ask my mom.
They're not picking me up until six.
I'll think about it.
All our parents are weirdoes. I think my dad is into hookers. I know he lit cats on fire when he was a kid.
My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking Rapist.
I think this is a big part of growing up. It's losing your spiritual virginity. It's when you finally discover that your parents aren't anything they told you they were. They're even bigger hypocrites than your friends.
I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
Are you coming to the party?
What's wrong? Am I doing something wrong?
Just making me feel like a piece of meat.
I'm making you feel like meat?
You break up with me because I won't fuck you.
That's not why we broke up.
You flaunt some slut in my face.
Sharon's far from a slut.
And when I finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat.
Please don't go. Please. Stay, We'll just talk. Then go to the party.
Jody. Wait.
What?
I'm scared. Three kids are dead. I want to go to this party.
My dad's down there!
Go to the police station!
Thanks for coming back for me.
Oh GOD IT'S HIM!
What are you doing?
Hi mom.
Hi princess.
Mom?
Yes?
I need to ask you something.
You can ask me anything.
Lisa Sherman?
Yeah. Who is she?
I don't know. Where did you hear that name.
I overheard daddy mentioning her to someone. I he thinks she's the killer.
What?
That's what he said.
Did he say anything else about her?
No but he got really weird. Like I've never seen him act. REALLY angry and super uptight.
I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind.
No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
Where are you going?
I want you to come home with me right now, Jody.
Who is she?
She's nobody you should be concerned with.
Whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of Lisa Sherman, clothes and all. I think that concerns me.
Wait.
What?
Years ago, something horrible happened in this town. When I was still in high school. A girl named Elizabeth Sherman was attacked by four drunken seniors.
Attacked how?
She was raped. At least that's what she claimed.
You didn't believe her?
No, I believed her. She was in pretty bad shape. Inside and out. But the boys were never formally charged.
Why not?
They were children of our leading citizens, stars of the football team. And she was a loner. An angry girl that no one really liked. She'd called them 'queers'.
People thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them 'queers'?
They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are sexually bottled up today....
And the police did nothing?
EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.
How could you?
I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town.
The word is Mob.
I've regretted it ever since. Never run with the herd just because they're the herd.
Who?
The men. Do any of them still live around here?
Two men left town right after it happened.
Mr. Sisler was one of them.
The principal?
Yes.
THAT'S why he called Mr. Sisler first. He was one of them.
Not a day has gone by where your father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened. We both have...
Yes?
Yeah.
I'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa.
Kenny's aunt?
On what side of the family?
His mother's side.
You ok?
Just thinking about something.
What?
There's going to be very few virgins left in school on Monday. It could be really dangerous for them if the killer isn't caught.
What are you doing?
I got to go.
What?
Dylan's been telling people that Annette gave him a blow job.
Hi Mark, Cindy, Ben.
You got a great mom. I'm lucky to get a zucchini stick.
Did you want one?
Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.
You can have both if you want.
You're so beautiful.
So are you.
Now don't be nervous.
There's Jan and Heather. Let's grab them quick before someone else does.
Ok.
Hide your laptop here.
No.
You can't bring it.
Hey! That was a 3k machine.
I said no.
Maybe it won't stay in.
Let me just ask you a serious question first.
What?
Aren't you worried you could die a virgin?
Yeah. I'm extremely worried about that. It's right up there with global warming.
On our way home, a drunken driver could hit us head on and send us flying through the windshield. Terminate us instantly. We'd never experience what it means to make love.
If sheep don't count.
That wasn't me ...
I know. I'm kidding you. Chill out.
Well I'm trying to be real here and you're mocking me.
Rod!
You're being unfair.
Unfair?!
Stacy?
What, do you work for my boss, dog?
Okay, okay.
At least somebody likes this shit.


help me get in the truck.

Oh...
...shit.
Oh, shit.
Unbe-fucking-lievable.
Damn.


Shit!
It's a damn postal truck!
Let me put it in easy terms, Aristotle. We are carrying a damn bomb...
...that is going to explode...
...if we don't get out of this tunnel!
Come on, Night Shift.
A little early for a delivery.
Oh...
...yeah. Tryin' to get most of my day done before it hits nine-...
...-ty.
Where's Sam?
Sam? Andy gave Sam a nice big desk to park his fat ass behind.
Where do you want this stuff?
Freezer in the back.
Great.
That's my business.
No argument there.
The guy's a fuckin' moron.
Hey, I'm with you on that one, my man. Prick.
Look, you need me to sign an invoice or somethin'?
Uh, between this month and last month, you owe four hundred and seventeen dollars. And we need that in cash.
Since when does...
...Darlene pay you in cash?
Since today. New policy.

Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. Move.

Well, he told me to collect cash.
Andy. Another fuckin'...
...moron.
Hey, you and I are seein' eye to eye on a whole range of issues this mornin'.
Uh, huh?
Except for the fact that I need cash.
He could've called first.
He could've. That-That's true. But that would've been smart...
...and fair...
...two things Andy is not. Uh, but I tell you what.
Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent...
...off. Say, uh, three seventy-five. Seein' that we both have so much love...
...for Andy, I'll tell him I lost a few cartons comin' over the mountain.
That'll make up the difference, huh?
Huh?
Well, Darlene usually gives me a signed check for emergencies. I could always give you that.
Oh.
Why don't I--?
Aw! Oh, Jesus.
Sorry, man. He's dead.
What did I say?
Dude in uniform get in your face, you do not shoot your mouth off.
I need your truck.

No, no, no. You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck...
...and a shitload of ice.
Look, if I don't get this stuff to McGruder, it's goodbye, Andy's Ice Cream, goodbye, Jerome, goodbye, Mon-...
...-tana.
Wait, wait. You don't believe the dead guy, do...
...ya?
Yeah, I believe him. He was my friend.
For cryin' out loud.
Hey, listen! Do you know what I think? I...
...think he was a wacko. And I think that G.I. ninja's a bigger wacko. And I think you're the biggest wack-...
...-o of all, wantin' to be a part of this wacko shit!
I need your help.
You are seriously mistaken if you think you are going anywhere in my...
...truck.
Then you drive me to McGrud-...
...-er.
Look...I got two tons of the world's nastiest ice cream sittin' in a truck that should've been retired ten years ago. That shit will be worthless by noon.
And if that Elvis shit...
...is as dangerous as you seem to think it is, I'm gettin' my ass as far away from you and it as possible.
Peace.
All right.

Wait, wait, wait. Hold up. Hold up. Look.
You want cash?
You want cash?
I got, like, uh....
I got, uh....
I got fifty bucks. I'll get more.
I'll rent the truck from you. You can stay here, you can go. Whatever you want.
No.
All right, then how about this?
Hey, you're gonna piss me-- What the hell are you supposed to be...
...doing?!
I need your truck!
Go on.
Would you hurry up, please?
Look, put this in the back. Keep it safe.

There we go. There we go. Did you keep it safe? Did you
What the hell is with you, dog? He's the one with the damn gun.
You gave him ice cream, didn't you? Come on, let's go.
Yeah, to keep him off my ass.
What did you do that for? It makes him mean as a snake.
That dog was mean before I met him.
That dog ain't mean.
I'm gonna stomp your a--
Come on, get in the truck.
I'm gonna bust a mudhole in your ass. I'm gonna-- Don't tell me to shut-- It's none of your business. Man, I can talk all I want to.
...up.
Are you kiddin'?

Come on!
Damn.
What the hell's goin' on?
It happens to this piece of shit...
...all the time.
Damn diesel injections are flood-...
Excuse me...
...-ed.
...excuse me. Can you fix this?

You'd better coast through...
...town.
We're clear.
No cell.
Billings? No, no, no, no, no. We need to go to McGruder.
No, you gotta go to McGrud-...
...-er.
No, no, no, no, no. We gotta go to McGruder! I go where the truck goes!
No, no, no.
To get to McGruder, you have to go through Missoula, and I ain't goin' to Missoula.
No way. We're goin' through McGrud-...
...-er.
I ain't goin' through Missoula!
Am I missing somethin' here?
Look...I kinda borrowed the truck from Andy.
Borrowed.
Yeah, borrowed!
You stole this truck.
You stole this truck!
I did not steal this truck!
You stole this truck! That's...
...what all the bullshit about the cash was, wasn't it?! You stole this truck, and now you're trying to sell...
...the ice cream for money!
I didn't steal the truck! He owed it to me! Anyway, the important thing is I'm not goin' through Missoula!
I'm about to get in your ass like last year's underwear, man.
That's...
...fine.
I ain't playin' that.

Hey.
We can't push old Pete in this heat. He can't take it.

God-...
...-damn!
Okay, okay!
Ah, one of them's in the back.
No, no, no, no, no. Keep goin'.



You're nuts, goin' back there!
Shut up.

Take your gun!
Doesn't work.
What?
Doesn't...
...work! It's not even load-...
...-ed.
Oh, shit.




Get him to stand up, Night Shift.
All right.
Okay! All right!
Elvis is on ice again.
Okay.
Nice job back there.

Don't gimme that "nice job" shit, man! They still got a vanload comin', and what do you got besides an empty...
...gun?!
I was thankin' you, asshole!
Kiss my ass!
Probably because they know a psycho when they hear one.
No...
...I'm not the psycho.
Hey, take a look at your situation and...
...reconsider that statement there, Night Shift. You're psy-...
...-cho and a hijack-...
...-er!
Hi--! The gun was empty!
Every time I look at you, I wanna hit...
...you.
You wanna hit me?
And I'm a peaceful man, and...
...I believe in live and...
Yeah...
...let live.
...you stole the truck to uphold your principles, right?
I did not steal the truck.

It was owed to me. You stole the damn...
...truck!
Shut up, shut up! It's beeping.
Well, then, that means it's call...
...waiting!
You snatch that phone from me one more time, I'm--


Holy shit...
...man!
Oh, shit.
Back up! Back...
...up!

Come on, old...
...Pete! Come on! There it...
...is, old Pete! Come on, baby!
Fuck!

Oh, shit.
Oh, we're screwed, Night...
...Shift.
You can just bend over and kiss your crazy ass goodbye, buddy!
I think...
...we can make it.
You think we can make what?! You see that truck?!
Eight and a half feet wide! Weighs over five tons!
Hey, and what if we don't make it?!

Your weedkiller on steroids goes down with us! Everybody dies!
I don't think we have much of a choice...
...do we?
Oh, shit.
That's right. Now, move!


Oh, shit.
Okay.

Goddamn!
I should've had that dog bite me. I would've gotten rabies! Could've went to the hospital, had a pretty nurse!
Hey, hey! Whoo! Okay.
Go, go, go, go, go. Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
Come on, old Pete.
Come on!
Come on, old Pete.
God, man!
I'm goin'. I'm goin', baby. I'm goin', I'm goin'.
Oh...
...easy, easy, easy.
Left, left, left!
Get over! Get over!
Come on.
Oh, shit. Come on, old...
...Pete! Come on.
Come on, old Pete. Oh.
I know the likeli-...
...-hood of you knowin' any prayers is slim...
...Night Shift, but you might...
...wanna give it a try!
Come on, old...
...Pete. Come on.

Come on.
Come on.
Come on...
...you crazy bastard.
Whoo!
Whoo!
I made it!
I made it.
What are you talkin' about?! I'm the one drivin'!
You okay?
What the fuck was that?!
Shit. You gotta pass him.
Gee, you think so?
Holy--!
Okay. That didn't work.
Gee, you think so?
Shut up!

Ho, ho...
Oh...
...ho!
...shit!


Hang on!
Hey!


Shit.
Go on.
Go, go.


Oh, Pete. Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

No. Shit.
Come on.
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Oh, shit. It's okay. Okay.

Okay.
All right.
Okay.
All right.
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that.
Okay. Okay.
These'll keep it cold.
Yeah...
...yeah.
Aw, shit

All right, let's go.

Okay. All right. Okay.

Listen! Listen...
...to him! You don't know who...
...you're dealin' with!
I'm a dangerous man!
Yeah, he's a dangerous...
...man!
He's crazy!

Taking it down the hill.
You're--? What?!

You're not dangerous! You're crazy! I ain't gettin' in this damn thing!
Then stay...
...here!
I don't want you to come anyway.
What?
Come on!

Keep still.
Okay. Okay.


Oh, shit!
No!
Oh, no!
Oh, no!


All right. Hey.




Uh-oh.
What?
This thing just went up a degree. Ice cream's not workin'.
This river's fed by a glacier. Willing to bet my life that it's a good deal under fifty degrees.
Okay.
Worth a try.

Hey, you didn't happen to lock the truck up when you got out...
...did you?
You're fucked, man.
See, now why would you do that to a man in my posi-...
...-tion?
Hey, I didn't steal the truck. You...
...stole the truck.
Hey, I told you I did not steal that truck. Andy owes me a lot more than that four-wheeled...
...piece of shit was worth.
It won't even start half the time.
You know what I'm sayin'?
I deserve a lot more than that truck! Ten years, ten years I busted my ass for that fat rat bastard.
And he swore, he swore once I got a degree...
...there'd be a sales rep desk with my name on it. But every time something opened up, there'd be some idiot cousin...
...or nephew or some good old boy...
...just ready to just slide him right in there. And what about me, huh? What about Arlo, huh? What about my needs? You know, I got a-I got student loans...
...overdrawn bank accounts.
Nobody's lookin' out for my interests. My credit was fucked! And then when he promoted Sam over me, I just snapped. So I split.
So you took his...
...truck.
So I took his truck, yeah.
Yeah.
You know, four years ago, I was a split end at Kentucky State.
We were nationally ranked.
How wonderful for you.
Started every game my senior year. Not all-American or anything, but not bad. Anyway, the real star was my best friend, the quarterback. Got taken in the first round.
Robert Del Rio?
Yeah, Robert Del Rio.
I remember him. Got in a car crash or somethin'.
We were celebrating right after the draft, going from bar to bar. I was drivin'.
And I put the car into a ditch. He spent eighteen weeks in the...
...hospital.
Never gonna throw a ball in the pros.
Couldn't deal with it. So I split.
And things sort of just went downhill from there.
Anyway, about ten months ago, I wound up in Jerome, workin' for Darlene.
Well, shit. Could be worse. I mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle.
We got two paddles.
Listen, Arlo...
...for whatever it's worth, I'm sorry I dragged you into this...
...shit.
To tell you the truth, you didn't.
Not completely, anyway.
I mean, if that gun was...
...loaded, I didn't buy you as a shoot- ...
...-er. It was your friend...
...Long. Somethin' about that look in his eye when he talked about that Elvis...
...shit.
Well, all the same. If we get to Missoula, help me find a car. I'd appreciate it. Then...you can...
...split.
Split? I wouldn't get ten...
...miles.


That is loud! I'm
Whoo!
All right, all right. Hey, hey.
Hey. Mason.
Yeah.
I think you oughta cut a...
...deal with this asshole.
Even though it is nice to see Andy...
...squirm, I don't want his brains all over my shirt...
...or my conscience.
A-And you owe me...
...man.


Bullshit. You would've killed us anyway.
Ow!


Are you all right?
Listen, Arlo.

They're takin' off.
Huh?
They're movin'.
Hey, just shut up.
We're gonna die!
Arlo, shut up.
We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!
Hey, hey, hey.

Put your hand in my pants.
What?

We're gonna die, and you want me to do some freaky shit like that?!
Arlo! Arlo.
Reach into my pocket.

Come on!
Oh.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.

Okay. All right, man. Okay.

Okay.
All right. Okay.

Okay.

Arlo!


Okay.

Okay, here we go.

Come here.
Go, go, go!
You just can't leave that stuff with that lu-...

...-natic.
That's why I didn't give it...
...to him.
What?
You got Elvis?!
Sometimes the prey bites back.
Go!

Stop.

Hang...
...on!
Aw, shit. Would you be more care-...
...-ful?!
Oh, fuck!
Forty-five seven!
Oh, shit.
We!
I've got the real thing!
Here...
...they come!
And Brynner's right on...
...our ass!
Okay...
...here comes the...
...tunnel!
Whoo!
Forty-seven. You'd better floor it.
What the hell?
What the--?
Stupid.
Unbe-fucking-lievable.
Shoot me.
What's it say?
Forty-nine point four.
Mason.
What?

All right
Oh.

Come on. Come on.
What?

What?
It's working.



We got-...
...-ta get outta here!
Vitelli! Vitelli!

Well, hell, the smoke's gonna kill us anyway!
There's gotta be...
...another way outta here. Hey.
Hold this.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Sorry.
Hang on, hang on.
Let's go!
Got it? Come on, darlin'. I gotcha.
Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis. You go.
They'll meet you at the top.
Okay. Come on, big guy!

Look out.
What'd you come back for?!
Why'd you stay behind?!




Well.

You know, we saved half a million people from a full-body peel.

We're the shit. Bigtime.
They aren't exactly gonna publicize this, Arlo.
Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey. We are heroes, my man. It's time to start actin' like it.

Stop limpin' around like that.
Excuse me. I got a bullet in my leg.
You did help a little.
Who drove the ice cream...
...truck that kept Elvis cool?
Who had to put a gun to your head?
Who put the big hurt on...
...that Army nut job to save your narrow butt?
You, Arlo.
Hello.
You.
Right. You damn skippy. And now that I am both jobless...
...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country...
...I feel that my government owes me a little restitution.
Us. Owes us.
Patriotism is its own reward.
I think so too.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
What about all that "no need to get in the man's...
...face" crap you've been telling me?
I was not in the man's face. I was nego-...
...-tiatin'.
Look. That's negotiating? He threatened to kill...
...us.
But he didn't. See, that's negotiation.
No.
That's bullshit.
Bullshit, yeah. Well...if we're not gonna be famous, at least this'll be a great story to tell some ladies in a bar or somethin'.
Oh!
Oh, oh!
I feel faint.
You know, it's, uh-it's very hush-hush, as we say in the spy game.
It all started with our mission in Istanbul.
Yeah.
I was undercover as a tennis player.
Yeah.
My code name was Blackjack. Night Shift was my coach. Uh-Uh-Uh, I'm sorry. Mason was my coach.

Uh, he handled rackets, and I carried the balls.
Yeah.
you see, that was a-that was my mission.
big balls.
Hey.
Hey, be cool.
Be cool. Be--
That was quick.

To tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist who's gone missing from the Tech Center. Maybe you know him. Richard Long.
We're worried...
...about him.
Give it to me now, or you'll be dead...
...within five minutes.
What'd he say?

Listen, shithead!
I got three thousand dollars of highly perishable ice cream products that taste bad enough when it's...
...frozen! So if you don't mind--!
Just give me Elvis and I'll make sure you have enough money for a dozen ice cream trucks.
Your move. Okay, Vaughn, you drive.
I urge you to be persuasive.
This country trained me to kill...
...without compunction.
Well, well, well.
Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?


And it won't be pleasant.
But...
...such is the price...of patriotism.
Vaughn.

Well, that just about figures for today.
So...where's my truck?
It's, uh, parked just off of Highway Thirty-Five.
I did what I could for you...
...Arlo, and you screwed me for it. Now, where's my goddamn truck?
Why don't you get that tub of shit Sam to...
...help you?
Yeah, that's my truck.
Mason, you have to take this...
...to Fort McGruder in his truck.
Wait. This town is full of trucks. Nice new trucks. You don't need to go...
...take my sorry old truck.
So you called the damned thing Elvis
I had no idea how powerful it was.
Eighteen men were k- killed in sec-...
...-onds...with just a fraction of what's in...
...here. Mason...

...about the man who did this, he's-he's comin' after it.
You-You can't let him...
...have it. You have to...have to get it to M...to McGruder.
You got a prob-...
...-lem too?
No, sir. I've never seen this guy before.

Well, why don't they talk to the sage of Jerome here?!
Listen, deputy.
He's the dude...
...the guy the Army guys are lookin' for!
What? Say again...
...Mason. I can barely hear you.
We've got it...
...on ice! We've got Elvis on ice!
All right, gentlemen. We're about done here. Fine job.
Thank you.
Your country and a lot of innocent people in it...
...owe you.
We do have to take into consideration that, through your courage...
...and selfless actions, you did save millions of lives.
Exactly.
However, you are also non-en-...
...-listed personnel with detailed knowledge of classified secrets falling under the National Security Act.
In order to protect those secrets, I am authorized to fine you, imprison you...
...to take any extreme measures I deem necessary...
...including the permanently extreme.



Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo!

Colonel Vitelli. We got a busted-in cold vault inside.
Is it--?
Looks like it. Yes, sir.
They were all wearing hardware.
Any of them Richard Long?
Yes, sir.
Doc-...
...-tor Long.
What the hell is all this about a detonation today? We're scheduled...
...to be off the island tonight.
And I changed the schedule.
I don't work for you, Captain Brynner.
Sweeney tells me you don't have computer confirmation?
You know, captain, if you hadn't spent so much of your career questioning your superiors, you might've found yourself with more gold leaf on your col-...
...-lar.
This isn't some kind of pissing contest, Long. You may be in charge here, but those men out there are my responsi-...
...-bility.
Look, this is a scientific experiment, okay?
If it works, your stock at the Pentagon will go up along with mine. I don't think I need to mention you could use the help.
The NSA thinks the UN is onto your work...
...here, and the White House is screaming about chemical weapons, and we're...
...sittin' here with our hands in the goddamn cookie jar! And let me tell you something else. I didn't join the service to let people like you turn...
...the United States into the kind of country we're supposed to be fighting against.
But you have no choice but to follow orders.
Now listen to me.
Now, I know. You have moral objections to what we're doing here, but believe...
...me, if I thought there was any real danger, I-I wouldn't go forward.
You have my word on that.
All right. One more shot, provided... we're off the island tonight.
"I am become Death, the...
...destroyer of worlds."
No!
No!

You'll kill us all!
Damn you, Long! My people are out there! Your people are out there!
Andrew...
...I wish they would've let me say something...
...about--

Is this stool taken?
No, go--
You look good, Richard.
You look fit...healthy...
...not at all like a man responsible for the deaths of eighteen peo-...
...-ple.
Is that why you're here? To blame...
...me? Well, you could've saved yourself the trip.
I know where the blame belongs. But I didn't put you in prison, Andrew. The government did...
...that.
Oh, I'm well aware of what the government did, I assure you. Actually, I've just come to say how grateful I am to you...
...and the government.
Grateful?
Mm-hm.
Together, you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone.
Do you remember telling me once that all through my career, I'd never fit in? Well...
...you were right, of course. But after...
...years of thinking the matter over, I began to see that the whole thing wasn't really my problem.
What rational man could fit in with the sorts of things our government was doing? The sorts of things you've...
...always done, Richard?
Do you think I haven't seen the bodies of those...
...men every time I've closed my eyes? But after you went away, I--
Went away?
"Went away." I like that.
Almost quaint.
All right. After they put you away...
...I began trying to find ways of controlling the effects of the weapon that we tested on Horn Island.
And let me guess. You failed.
So far, ye-yes.

Do you know what'll...
...happen if I drop this?
Brynner.
Well, Lieutenant Vitelli.
Good to see you again, Leo.
Pleasant surprise.
I can't say it's a surprise.
And I certainly can't say it's pleasant.
As soon as I heard Elvis was on the loose, you came to mind.
I checked your release date. I never liked coincidences.
Yeah, I had a small problem with members of our side murdering civil-...
...-ians. But I assure you, Leo...
...I lost all my squeamishness at Leav- ...
...-enworth. I'll have no compunction at all about using this.
Hm. The wind's northwest. That oughta be...Seattle.
Or I may be wrong. The breeze could be gusting south. That'd be Billings...
...maybe even Salt Lake, not to mention Casper...
...Destry, Fair Oaks....
Knowing you, Brynner, you've got buyers waiting to buy! You're not gonna use that...
...here!
And I'm warning you, Leo. Don't test me. Get your men and your machines off my radar screen in five, or three million people will die.
I'll do it.
Get 'em on line, then stall. Long can't have gotten far.
Closin' down, sir.
There's nothing in here, sir. They got away with it.
All right. Let's clear the mess and move out.
Besides, how are we gonna sell something we don't have?


This is it.

Move. This is already affecting our schedule.
Dennis, radio the bikes. I wanna know if so much as a squirrel...
...comes up that road.
Well. It appears someone's been lying to us.

Radio the bikes.
Dutiful citizens, you have something which I have waited years for.
You have no idea what you're in possession of, do you?

And so Missoula's prodigal son returns.
Of which we have more than enough.
All right. Tell the pilot we'll be a half-hour.
Carl! Set up the camera.
Carl, establish contact with that deputy we met earlier. He'll be more useful now.
Hit him.
Hit him again.


Vaughn.
There.
It's clean.
Check the immediate area.
This was supposed to be a...
...quick in and out.
Sir, all potential customers have been informed of the delay. Fur-...
...-ther orders?
Vaughn, get the M-seventy-nine ready.
You can't fire on them. You're gonna detonate the crystals.
Shit.
Just when we have all the cards, Vaughn. Take these two behind the van.
Dennis!
Get your links set up!
I wanna patch in from...
...here!
What about these two?
We're gonna use them for demonstration footage.
Having witnessed the effects myself, I can assure you it'll be very useful when the bidding starts.
Get 'em in the middle of the dam.
I'm on it.
This river ends at a hydro dam...
...in Missoula. All we need to do is get to Mason before anyone else does.
Carl, Dennis, get out of sight.
Officer Pappas, I'm glad you're here.
Mind if you tell me what's goin' on?
I'm Colonel Brynner, U.S. Special Operations Com-...
...-mand out of Fort Bragg.
We were called in by the Jerome base...
...to pursue a man who's stolen government proper-...
...-ty.
Right. Tim Mason.
You know the suspect?
Yeah, he's wanted in connection with a death this morning at the Jerome...
...general store.
Richard Long.
That's right.
Hemmings! Sam, I thought I told you to close up shop and be ready to move up the island by night-...
...-fall.
Yes, Captain Brynner, you did, but-but--
But...
...what, Sam? Can't I go down to the loading dock for a few hours without coming back to find a major...
...screwup?
Uh, with all due respect, sir, Dr. Long told me to prep the field for detonation at...
...noon.
Jesus Chri-- We're on a very slippery slope here, Sam. A covert military operation riddled with civilian...
...scientists.
You don't think it's that bad, do you, sir? I mean, Long's spent the last two years developing his defoliant. The stuff can't even kill crabgrass yet.
Where's their protective...
...gear?
It's a hundred degrees...
...out here, captain. Don't you think the guys deserve a break?
We gotta get help. Aw, fuck! Damn.
Mornin'.
Is this your establishment?
Yeah, they call me Dar-...
....-lene.
Well, then, how about a cup of coffee, Darlene?
Iced coffee.
I assume you want that to go.
Assumptions are always...
...dangerous.
Quite a getup for jacking...
...deer.
I beg your pardon?
Uh, you wanna hunt outta season, it's cool with me. But mostly, well, they just take a six...
...and a rifle. You, on the other hand...
...look like you're after something more dangerous.
Actually, I was just looking for a restroom.
I assume you have one.
Doc...
...Long.
Doc Long. Yeah, I know him. Weirdo guy. He comes in from...
...time to time, yeah.
Not tonight...
...though.

Odd, then, that his car...
...should be right outside.
Yeah?
Contrary to what Dr. Long may have told you, this is neither...
...your concern nor your fight. Relinquish the package and you can go.
I want you to look at one another...
...and ask a simple question - Are you actually prepared...
...to die for a country that's...
...never done a thing for you?
Because if you don't give me that cylinder, your lives will end...
...on this miserable road to nowhere.
And I can't guarantee the end will be quick.
Hello.
Yeah, I'm listenin'.
I don't see my container.
You try anything, it goes in...
...the river.
It's a little late for matinee heroics, Mason. Just give me the con-...
...-tainer!
Where's Arlo?

Your fellow hero, untouched...
...and unharmed, de-...
...-spite the mouth.













No.
Where's Elvis?!
Dead, last time I...
...checked.







Why? You're a nothing, nobody! Why?
You'd never understand!
I would've in another life.


Goddamn it, Ma-...
...-son. Of all the days for you to show up late. First, the idiot April calls in sick. Then I got a bad tooth...
...and then my night man shows up when he feels like...
...it.
Darlene, it's five-thirty. Now, I worked late for you this mornin', and you didn't wanna spring for over-...
...-time, remember?
Oh. Well, I have got to get to the dentist be-...
...-fore he closes, which means you're gonna have to cover the grill and the floor.
I can handle it.
Yeah?
Be sure you feed Bosco.
And don't give him any ice cream...
...like April. It gives him gas. And make sure there's two pots of coffee...
Two pots of coffee...
...ready before the morning crowd blows in.
Oh, caught a few, lost a few.
Story of my life. Well, one thing you won't lose is that friend of yours back there, I'll tell you that.
Oh, no?
Oh, you're two of a kind, doc. Oh, he may not have your sheepskins, and...
...well, most of the time he looks like something the cat might have dragged in, but, you know...
...he's smart enough to get you...
...somehow.
There's something else too.
Uh, we both like to fish.
Secrets.
Ah.
His I know. Yours I don't have a clue. But if it wasn't for you, I think he'd have drifted right on through this town.

You know, I have yet to get a simple cup of coffee and a meal in this place, Darlene.
Video lock.
You got thirty minutes.
It's after five...
Rangers.
Go.
Sir, I got Taipei grindin' on me here. How long is this supposed to ta--?
Geneva just pulled the plug.
Kabula's out.
Hit it...
...now!
No sign of 'em...
Forty-nine?
Major, we've gotta seal that tunnel! Major!
Great. All right...
...we're gonna seal that tunnel! I want it air-...
...tight!
Colonel, sir, who the hell is this guy?
It's not over, Brynner.
Sir, we can't just let him get away with this!
Gomez, you fight the battles you can win. Now, we've been outmaneuvered here. Brynner's next move is gonna be to get Elvis out of the country and sell him to the highest bidder. To do that, he has to have planned an exit point. That's where we intercept him. That's where we make our play. Now you and your men back off.

What's going on, colonel?
...that tunnel.
Is Elvis out?
That little geek is my...
...son.
Thanks.
It must've happened right after we left.
Missoula's reporting the refrigerator truck as a stolen vehicle. I told you Mason was walking shit.
Pappas, that other guy was unloading ice cream into a freezer. Now, what could he have to do with a military scientist, huh?
The sooner you get up the lab, the sooner you'll figure it out.

And where are you going?
Deputy Art Lewis, Jerome County Sheriff's Department.
Uh-huh.
I don't suppose you'd like to tell me what this is all about.
What the hell are you talkin' about...
...colonel?
Well, I've got Dr. Long's body down at the coroner's office.
One of our units is pursuing a suspect up the thirty-...
...-five.
Who's your suspect?
A man named Tim Ma-...
...-son.
Mason? No, he's a soda-jerk drifter, a hamburger flipper.
Morning, doc. Awful early, aren't ya?
Couldn't sleep, Pumper. Is everything, uh, all right tonight?
There's nothin' goin' on out there, doc...except maybe the occasional fly fisherman.

Hey, doc. Might wanna...
...try this one out some-...
...-time.
Excellent.

Been trying to figure out your secret.
My secret?
Yeah. Ten months we've been fishin' this river together. We use the same equipment, more or less...
...but you pull twice as many fish out of the water as I do.
And I'm good at this. Been doing it since I was a kid. But you, I don't know. Somehow you think...
...like a fish.
No, that's not possible, Mason. The trout...
...is a perfect hunter.
He's brains without ambition...
...sensitivity without neurosis. He's...
...the master of his realm.
How can we ever hope to win against the trout?
There's only one way you can do it, Mason.
Turn the power of the hunter against him.
Tie a fly...
...create a piece of bait that sends the fish's instincts into overdrive...
...forcing him to strike. And only then does our noble friend realize that the prey...can bite...
...back...
...and that power...
...without caution...
...is death.
Some people might say you're readin' an awful lot in-...
...-to a simple thing like...
...fishin'.

Mason.
Shit! Oh, shit.
Call an ambulance.
The compound has to be kept cold...
...or it'll ignite.
Cold? Cold. How cold?
Never let it reach fifty degre-degrees.
And what if it does?
You're the only one I can trust.
The only one who understands what this me-...
...-m-means, Mason.
Yeah, I just....
Tryin' to remember somethin' somebody once told me about tyin' a fly.
And only then does our noble friend realize...
...that the prey can bite back.

Mr. Sweeney, how goes it?
Well, Costello's finished with the stability profile, but Abbott is still chewing on the load file.
So reaction temperature is fifty degrees.
Well, your prediction was on the nose.
How much longer for the range and power projections?
I don't know. Um, he's working, but there's a lot of data. Maybe...another hour?
Dr. Long!
I got eight thousand yards. Radius is five...
...miles.
...you, Mason?
What? Say again, Ma-...
...-son.
What we gave Brynner on the dam was a phony!
We've got the real thing!
Where are you now...
...Mason?
Mason, what is the temperature of Elvis?!
Forty-seven.
If you're not out of there soon, I have got to seal the...
...tunnel!
Mason. Mason!
There's a vent shaft leading straight up.
So, Mason, last Wednesday night, uh...were you out...
...uh, drifting around like the trash you are, or were you here workin'?
If it was Wednesday night, I was workin'.
Do you recognize this young man?
Nope. Is there a prob-...
...-lem?
You find yourself wearing a...
...badge someday, then you can ask the questions. Until then...
...you answer mine.
Got that?
So you don't remember...
...selling this young man beer Wednesday night.
I don't sell beer to minors. I take that kinda thing...
...seriously.
Lying?
Mason, you wouldn't know the truth if it bit you. We've got your whole record. We know about the-the conviction for vagrancy...
...public drunkenness....
I didn't sell the boy any...
...beer.
Shut your mouth until I tell you...
...to talk, son.
You know, I gotta tell you. That really bothers me, somebody calls me "son."
Let me see your...
...hands!
I said let me see your hands now!
You redneck idiot, do you have...
...any idea what's goin' on here?!
Yeah, asshole. I'm puttin' a murder suspect and a guy who...
...stole a truck under arrest.

Listen, Pappas...
...there's a colonel...
...on the other end of this phone.
His name's Vitelli. Talk to him. He's right out-...
...side!
What happened to Colonel Brynner?
Wait. Listen to me, Pappas. If you don't let us by...
...we're all gonna die in this...
...tunnel now!
Just go check the temperature.
Don't move!
What the hell was that?
The Army, sealin' us in.
All right.
I'll lead 'em out.

You sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
All right, go.
Okay, doc.
The usual. Doc.
Get in






Gimme this god-...
...-damn phone.
Talk to me.
Arlo.



Oh.
We've gotta take out Brynner's van before they reach...
Do it now.
Uh, so head for the other end of the tunnel.
I'll stay here and secure this position.
It's too late, Mason. I've...
...gotta seal it.
Negative. Negative.
There's ammo fire from Brynner's vehicle.
He must've had a damn arsenal in there.
Now! Seal that tunnel now!
Look at that.
Barney, who is this bimbo? He a regular customer?
Take it easy, Jake.
Look, pal. I make an honest living. People don't come to me unless they're miserable and I help 'em out of a bad situation. I don't kick them out of their homes like you jerks who work in the bank.
I don't know how that got in the paper as a matter of fact  it surprised me it was so quick. I make an honest living.
'Course you do, Jake.
An honest living.
I'll settle for L.A. County.
How come all these new names are pasted into the plat book?
Then these are all new owners?
That's right.
But that means that most of the valley's been sold in the last few months.
If that's what it says.
Can I check one of these volumes out?
Sir, this is not a lending library, it's the Hall of Records.
Well, then, how about a ruler?
A ruler?
Sir?
I said horseshit. Horseshit.
Always?
You know, you've got a nasty reputation, Mr. Gittes. I like that.
Thanks.
If you were a bank president that would be one thing, but in your business it's admirable. And it's good advertising.
It doesn't hurt.
It's why you attract a client like my daughter.
Probably.
But I'm surprised you're still working for her, unless she's suddenly come up with another husband.
How did she get that idea?
Fine, as long as you don't serve chicken that way.
Tell me. What do the police say?
They're calling it an accident.
Who's the investigating officer?
Lou Escobar  he's a Lieutenant.
Do you know him?
Oh yes.
Where from?
We worked in Chinatown together.
Would you call him a capable man?
Very.
Honest?
Far as it goes. Of course he has to swim in the same water we all do.
Of course, but you've got no reason to think he's bungled the case?
None.
That's too bad.
Too bad?
It disturbs me, Mr. Gittes. It makes me think you're taking my daughter for a ride. Financially speaking, of course. How much are you charging her?
My usual fee, plus a bonus if I come up with any results.
If you want an answer to that question I can always put one of my men on the job. Good afternoon, Mr. Cross.
Mr. Gittes! You're dealing with a disturbed woman who's lost her husband. I don't want her taken advantage of. Sit down.
What for?
Why is that funny?
It's what the D.A. used to tell me about Chinatown.
...Exactly what do you know about me, Mr. Gittes?
Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.
'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis' girlfriend.
His girlfriend?
Yes, his girlfriend.
You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?
Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?
Yeah.
Doesn't that strike you as odd?
No. She's probably scared to death.
Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?
Maybe.
If Mulwray was murdered, she was probably one of the last people to see him.
You didn't see Mulwray much, did you?
No.
Sheriff's gold posse... bunch of damn fools who pay $5,000 apiece to the sheriff's reelection. I let 'em practice up out here.
At my age, you tend to lose track...
I've got the photographs in my office. If they'll help you remember. What was the argument about?
My daughter.
What about her?
Just find the girl, Mr. Gittes. I think she is frightened and I happen to know Hollis was fond of her. I'd like to help her if I can.
Hollis Mulwray made this city and he made me a fortune... We were a lot closer than Evelyn realized.
If you want to hire me, I still have to know what you and Mulwray were arguing about.
Well... she's an extremely jealous person. I didn't want her to find out about the girl.
How did you find out?
I've still got a few teeth in my head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends in town.
Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her?
Just find the girl.
I'll look into it as soon as I check out some avocado groves.
Avocado groves?
Well, you don't look any the worse for wear, Mr. Gittes, I must say... where's the girl?...
I've got her.
Is she all right?
She's fine.
Where is she?
I'd like you to look at something, Mr. Cross.
What is it?
An obituary column... can you read in this light?
What does this mean?
...the coroner's report showed Mulwray had salt water in his lungs.
Hollie was always fond of tide-pools. You know what he used to say about them?
Haven't the faintest idea.
That's where life begins... marshes, sloughs, tide-pools... he was fascinated by them... you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there, instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs. You'd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty. He made this city.
And that's what you were going to do in the Valley?
No, Mr. Gittes. That's what I am doing with the Valley. The bond issue passes Tuesday. There'll be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir. I'm doing it.
There's going to be some irate citizens when they find out they're paying for water they're not getting.
That's all taken care of. You see, Mr. Gittes. Either you bring the water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to the water.
How do you do that?
How much are you worth?
I have no idea. How much do you want?
I want to know what you're worth. Over ten million?
Oh, my, yes.
Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can't already afford?
The future, Mr. Gittes. The future. Now where's the girl?... I want the only daughter I have left... as you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.
Hello.
Have you got your checkbook handy, Mr. Cross? I've got the girl.
You've got her? Where?
Do you remember the figures we discussed?
Of course I do. Where are you?
At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well?
Either that or she'll be in jail.
What are you talking about?
She's just no good.
What can I tell you, Kid? You're right. When you're right, you're right, and you're right.
You're absolutely right, I wouldn't give her another thought.
You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I know it's your job, but you're okay.
Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake.
Thanks. You know something, Jake?
What's that, Curly?
They don't kill a guy for that.
Oh they don't?
...No...
I'll pay the rest next trip. We only caught sixty ton of skipjack around San Benedict. We hit a chubasco, they don't pay you for skipjack the way they do for tuna or albacore.
What kind of guy do you think I am?
Thanks, Mr. Gittes.
Gee, this is a surprise, Mr. Gittes.
Call me Jake. How is everything?
Just sitting down to supper, Jake. Care to join us?
No thanks.
Sure thing.
Curly, where's your car?
In the garage.
Where's that?
Off the alley.
Could you drive me somewhere?
Sure, as soon as we eat.
Right now, Curly. It can't wait.
I'll just tell my wife.
How much do you owe me, Curly?
Oh, gee, Mr. Gittes we're going out tomorrow. I know you been real good about it but my cousin Auggie's sick.
Forget it. How would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to Ensenada... you'd have to leave tonight.
I don't know...
I might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it for you. Maybe an even hundred.
Plus what I owe you?
I'll throw that in too.
Tell Mrs. Mulwray to wait for half an hour after you get there. Then if I don't show, take her down to the boat.
You sure this is okay?
So there's this fella who's tired of screwing his wife.
Jake, listen.
There's seven ashtrays in this room, Duffy.
Okay.
That's a filthy habit.
I said okay, Jake.
Then what'll you do?
Yes.
I've been wanting to meet you.
Why?
Did you know that you're a very wealthy woman?
I'm not.
Well you own a lot of land.
That's just lovely.
Where did you get this material?
The apple core club.
The apple core?
No. The albacore. It's a fish. My grandson's a member and they take very nice care of us.
How do they do that?
Give us things. Not just some old flag like this, but -
Hello, Jake.
How are you, Lou?
I have a cold I can't seem to shake but other than that, I'm fine.
Summer colds are the worst.
Thanks, Lou.
How'd you get past the guards?
You've done well by yourself.
I get by.
You're behind the times, Jake. They've got steam irons now. And I'm out of Chinatown.
Since when?
Congratulations.
Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?
Looking for someone.
Who?
Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?
Oh yes.
I'd like to talk to him.
You wouldn't happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman.
No.
Or her name?
I don't want it anymore.
No?
No. It was an accident.
No, he drowned a cousin of mine with about five hundred other people. But they weren't very important, just a bunch of dumb Mexicans living by a dam. Now beat it, Gittes, you don't come out of this smelling like a rose, you know.
Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with?
What are you doing here?
Didn't you call?
How do you happen to know her?
I don't.
Isn't that your number?
Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often.
Yeah, I took 'em. So what?
You really think I'm stupid, don't you, Gittes?
I don't think about it one way or the other. But if you want, give me a day or two, and I'll get back to you. Now I'd like to go home.
I want the rest of the pictures.
What pictures?
This broad hired you, Gittes, not Evelyn Mulwray.
Yeah?
Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake down Mulwray, she hired you, and that's how you happen to know Mulwray was murdered.
I heard it was an accident.
You were following him night and day. You saw who killed him. You even took pictures of it. It was Evelyn Mulwray. She's been paying you off like a slot machine ever since her husband died.
You accusing me of extortion?
Absolutely.
I don't think I need a day or two. You're even dumber than you think I think you are. Not only that, I'd never extort a nickel out of my worst enemy, that's where I draw the line, Escobar.
Yeah, I once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. That's where she drew the line.
I want those photographs, Gittes. We're talking about accessory after the fact, conspiracy, and extortion. Minimum.
Mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody didn't want his body found in the ocean.
And why's that?
What are you talking about?
It's too late.
Too late for what?
I know what he says.
I don't suppose you got any idea Where she went?
Matter of fact I do.
Where?
Her maid's house. I think she knows something's up.
What's the maid's address?
She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down for you.
No, Gittes, you'll show us.
What for?
If she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up.
Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.
That's it?
Yeah.
Well, let's go.
You never learn, do you, Gittes?
I guess not.
Give you three minutes.
Mrs. Mulwray, you don't want to run around like that.
Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later.
Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. It's a felony.
Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray.
Lou, she will kill you. Let her go for now. You don't know.
Who is he, get his name? I'll kill him.
Take it easy, take it easy, it was an accident.
Get him away from her. He's responsible for everything. Get him away from her!
It looks like he was washed the entire length of the runoff channel. Could he swim?
Of course.
...Well, it didn't make him happy...
But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
No.
No.
Do you know where she might be?
You and your husband never discussed her?
He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name. We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me.
A complete surprise?
Yes.
But I thought you'd hired a private investigator.
A private investigator?
Mr. Gittes.
Will you need me for anything else, Lieutenant?
Not that Mulwray?
Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And since you agree with me we've never met, you must also agree that I haven't hired you to do anything. Certainly not spy on my husband. I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes. Well, you're going to get it.
Would you like something to drink?
What are you having?
Iced tea.
My husband's at the office.
Actually he's not. And he's moved from his apartment at the El Macando.
That's not his apartment.
I'm just trying to make a living, and I don't want to become a local Joke.
Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it. I'll drop the lawsuit.
What?
So let's just drop the whole thing. Sugar? Lemon?
Mrs. Mulwray?
Yes, Mr. Gittes?
I should talk this over with your husband.
Why?... What on earth for? Look, Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man.
You see, somebody went to a lot of trouble here, and I want to find out, lawsuit or no lawsuit. I'm not the one who's supposed to be caught with my pants down... so I'd like to see your husband. Unless that's a problem.
What do you mean?
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course. She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere.
Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
No. I went riding rather early.
Looks like you went quite a distance.
No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.
I'll stop by.
Mrs. Mulwray?... Mrs. Mulwray.
...Just a minute...
You left your keys in the ignition.
Thank you for going along with me. I just didn't want to explain anything... I'll send you a check.
I got your check in the mall.
Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not good enough.
Well, how much would you like?
Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.
I have?
I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.
Sorry. Look, you sue me, your husband dies, you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato, and all of it quicker than wind from a duck's ass. Excuse me. Then you ask me to lie to the police.
It wasn't much of a lie.
If your husband was killed it was. This can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence.
Well, I suppose I am... actually I knew about the affair.
How did you find out?
My husband.
And you weren't the slightest bit upset about it?
You'll have to explain that, Mrs. Mulwray.
Why?
Unless what?
I don't like the word 'cheat.'
Did you have affairs?
Mr. Gittes.
Did he know?
Is there anything else you want to know?
Where you were when your husband died.
I can't tell you.
You mean you don't know where you were?
I mean I can't tell you.
For very long?
K... Cross.
That your maiden name?
Yes... why?
You must've had a reason to ask me that.
No. I'm just a snoop.
You seem to have had a reason for every other question.
No, not for that one.
How did it happen?
Been meaning to talk to you about that.
Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
Another satisfied client?
Oh, no. I've got my own car. The creamcolored Packard.
Wait a minute, sonny. I think you better come with me.
Whoever's behind my husband's death, why have they gone to all this trouble?
Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that I don't know.
Your father is Julian Cross, isn't he?
Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that.
You've got one going, Mrs. Mulwray.
Is there something upsetting about my asking about your father?
No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...
Over the water department, or over you?
Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me?
Then it was over the water department.
Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes and no. Hollis felt the public should own the water but I don't think my father felt that way. Actually, it was over the Van der Lip. The dam that broke.
Oh, yeah?
Yes. He never forgave him for it.
Never forgave him for what?
For talking him into building it, he never forgave my father... They haven't spoken to this day.
You sure shout that?
Of course I'm sure.
What are you thinking?
That dam is a con job.
What dam?
The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it, only the water won't go to L.A. It'll go here.
The Valley?
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today. That bother you?
No.
In the last three months, Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres, Emma Dill 12,000 acres, Clarence Speer 5,000 acres, and Jasper Lamar Crabb 25,000 acres.
Jasper Lamar Crabb?
Know him?
No, I think I'd remember.
Yeah. They've been blowing these farmers out of here and buying their land for peanuts. Have any idea what this land'll be worth with a steady water supply? About thirty million more than they paid.
And Hollis knew about it?
We got it. We got it, baby.
What? What is it?
There was a memorial service at the Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar Crabb. He died three weeks ago.
Is that unusual?
You're looking at the owners of a 50,000 acre empire.
They can't be.
I'll stay.
Maid's night off?
Why?
What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's here, that's all.
I gave everybody the night off.
Easy, it's an innocent question.
No question from you is innocent, Mr. Gittes.
Tell me something. Does this usually happen to you, Mr. Gittes?
What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
Well, I'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if that's how you go about your work, I'd say you're lucky to get through a whole day.
Actually this hasn't happened to me in some time.
When was the last time?
Why?
It was in Chinatown.
What were you doing there?
Working for the District Attorney.
As little as possible.
The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?
Boy oh boy, you're a mess.
Yeah.
So why does it bother you to talk about it... Chinatown...
Hold still. Why?
You can't always tell what's going on there.
...No. Why was it.
I thought I was keeping someone from being hurt and actually I ended up making sure they were hurt.
What's wrong?
Your eye.
What about it?
There's something black in the green part of your eye.
Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...
...A flaw...
Where?
Just... I have to.
And I want to know where.
Please don't be angry... believe me, it's got nothing to do with you.
Where are you going?
Please!... Trust me this much... I'll be back. Look, there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag.
The Albacore Club.
It has to do with my father.
I know.
He owns it. You know?
I saw him.
You saw my fa... father? When?
This morning.
You didn't tell me.
What did he say? What did he say?
That you were jealous, and he was worried about what you might do.
Do? To who?
I want you to listen to me. My father is a very dangerous man. You don't know how dangerous. You don't know how crazy.
Give me an example.
You may think you know what's going on, but you don't.
That's what your father said. You're telling me he's in back of this whole thing?
It's possible.
Including the death of your husband?
Okay, give me the keys.
You bastard.
It's either that or you drive to the police yourself.
The police?
C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray. You've got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there!
She's not tied up!
You know what I mean. You're keeping her there against her will.
I am not!
She's too upset.
What about?
Hollis' death. I tried to keep it from her, I didn't want her upset before I could make plans for her to leave.
You mean she just found out?
Yes.
That's not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray.
What does it look like?
Like she knows about Hollis' death. Like she knows more than you want her to tell.
Just tell me the truth. I'm not the police. I don't care what you've done. I'm not going to hurt you, but one way or another I'm going to know.
You won't go to the police if I tell you?
I can't...
I took your husband's Buick... I'll return it tomorrow.
Aren't you coming back with me?
Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.
Did you get some sleep?
Sure.
Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something.
Where's the girl?
Upstairs. Why?
I want to see her.
Going somewhere?
J. J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar
What are you doing? What's wrong? I told you we've got a 4:30.
You're going to miss your train! Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah, soon as you can.
What did you do that for?
You know any good criminal lawyers?
No...
Don't worry. I can recommend a couple. They're expensive but you can afford it.
I found these in your backyard... in your fish pond. They belonged to your husband, didn't they?... didn't they?
I don't know. I mean yes, probably.
Yes positively. That's where he was drowned...
What are you saying?
There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license.
Stop it! I'll make it easy. You were jealous, you fought, he fell, hit his head. It was an accident, but his girl is a witness. You've had to pay her off. You don't have the stomach to harm her, but you've got the money to shut her up. Yes or no?
...no...
That's good. Now what's her name?
Katherine.
Katherine?... Katherine who?
I said the truth!
I said I want the truth.
...he had a breakdown... the dam broke... my mother died... he became a little boy... I was fifteen... he'd ask me what to eat for breakfast, what clothes to wear!... It happened... then I ran away...
Hollis came and took... care of me... after she was born... he said... he took care of her... I couldn't see her... I wanted to but I couldn't... I just want to see her once in a while... take care of her... that's all... but I don't want her to know... I don't want her to know...
Yeah... where are you taking her now?
Back to Mexico.
You can't go by train. Escobar'll be looking for you everywhere.
How about a plane?
That's worse... Just get out of here. Walk out, leave everything.
I have to go home and get my things.
I'll take care of it.
Where can we go?
...where does Kyo live?
With us.
On his day off. Get the exact address.
How do you know?
Let me handle that.
I'm all right.
Walsh here?
Sophie, go to the little girl's room for a minute.
But, Mr. Gittes.
Sophie.
Sophie.
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
Where'd he go yesterday?
Three reservoirs. Men's room of a Richfield gas station on Flower, and the Pig 'n Whistle.
Jesus Christ, this guy's really got water on the brain.
What'd you expect? That's his job.
Listen, we can't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something.
I think I got something.
Oh yeah? You pick up the watch?
Sophie... is Walsh there?... yeah, listen, pal, Escobar's going to try and book me in about five minutes... relax, I'll tell you. Wait in the office for two hours. If you don't hear from me, you and Duffy meet me at 1712 Alameda.
Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.
Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
Well, I'm a working girl, Mr. Gittes. I didn't come in to see you on my own.
When did you come in?
Shut the fuck up! ...Yes I remember nothing, Miss Sessions, just going over a detail or two with my associates... you were saying?
Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen.
I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both.
Oh no.
...Why don't you give me your address and we can talk this over?
No, Mr. Gittes. Just look in the obituary column of today's Times...
The obituary column?
You'll find one of those people.
Yeah, Sophie.
A Miss Sessions calling.
Who?
Ida Sessions.
Miss Ida Sessions again. She says you know her.
Oh my goodness.
Naturally, I want the best for him, money is no object.
Perhaps if we could meet your father.
There's just one question.
Of course.
I'm sorry. We don't.
Just to be certain, I wonder if you could show us a list of your patients?
That's exactly what we wanted to hear.
Oh, good.
I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
I don't think so. Be happy to show you.
Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?
Just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. It's nearly bedtime.
Can I help you? Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the Department.
J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
After all, you work with a man for a certain length of time, you come to know him, his habits, his values, and so forth. Well either he's the kind who chases after women or he isn't.
And Mulwray isn't?
He never even kids about it.
You don't happen to know where Mr. Mulwray's having lunch?
I'm sorry, I --
Mind if I take one of your cards? In case I want to get in touch with you again.
Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you. Do you know Claude Mulvihill here?
Mr. Gittes, sorry to keep you waiting. These staff meetings, they just go on and on.
Yeah, must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances.
Oh yes. Hollis was the best department head the city's ever had. My goodness, what happened to your nose?
I cut myself shaving.
You ought to be more careful. That must really smart.
Only when I breathe.
Only when you breathe... don't tell me you're still working for Mrs. Mulwray?
I never was.
I don't understand.
Neither do I, actually. But you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me.
Mr. Gittes, you're not making a bit of sense.
Well, look at it this way, Mr. Yelburton. Mulwray didn't want to build a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around, so. you decided to ruin it. Then he found out that you were dumping water every night. Then he was drowned.
Mr. Gittes! That's an outrageous accusation. I don't know what you're talking about.
Wait. Please sit down, Mr. Gittes. We're... well, we're not anxious for this to get around, but we have been diverting a little water to irrigate avocado and walnut groves in the northwest valley. As you know, the farmers there have no legal right to our water, and since the drought we've had to cut them off. The city comes first, naturally. But, well,
Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards?
I said, the northwest valley.
That's like saying they're in Arizona.
You're a married man, am I right?
Yes...
Hard working, have a wife and kids...
Yes...
Mr. Gittes?
Yes?
Do you know me?
Well... I think I... I would've remembered.
Have we ever met?
Well, no.
Never?
Never.
Speak English?... Habla Ingles?
Si.
The water.
What about the water?
When it comes.
When it comes? What'd you tell him?
Jake, what're you doin' here?
Yeah? Ain't that something? Middle of a drought, the water commissioner drowns. Only in L.A.
Yeah. Banged up pretty bad.
That's a long fall.
Yeah.
Come again?
Yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in the bottom of the riverbed.
The L.A. River?
It's bone dry, Morty.
It's not completely dry.
Gittes?... Gittes?
Yeah.
Ida Sessions wants to see you.
Yeah?... I do?
Sure you do.
How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray?
Mr. Gittes...
No, really?
I'm afraid so.
Can't we talk about this alone, Mr. Gittes?
I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. I can't do everything myself.
Of course not.
Mrs. Mulwray, do you love your husband?
...Yes of course.
Then go home and forget about it.
But...
I'm sure he loves you, too. You know the expression, let sleeping dogs lie? You're better off not knowing.
All right, what's your husband's first name?
Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.
This type of investigation can be hard on your pocketbook, Mrs. Mulwray. It takes time.
No problem with me on the Job.
Yeah. Do you have any references?
City of La Habra Heights filled an 800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days.
That's swell. But how about here? Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons, or Jasper Lamar Crabb?
Never heard of 'em... new owners?
Yeah.
Lot of turnover these days. Better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.
Mr. Mulwray, please.
He's not in, Mr.?
Gittes.
May I ask what this is regarding?
It's personal. Has he been out long?
Since lunch.
Gee whiz. And I'm late.
He was expecting you?
Mr. Yelburton will be busy for some time.
Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll wait.
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.
Julian Cross worked for the water department?
Yes. No.
He did or he didn't?
He owned the water department?
Yes.
He owned the entire water supply for the city?
Yes.
How did they get it away from him?
Mr. Mulwray felt the public should own the display. The water. If you'll just read the display.
Mulwray? I thought you said Cross owned the department.
Along with Mr. Mulwray.
They were partners.
This?
They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle.
What about?
I don't know. The traffic was pretty loud. I only heard one thing  apple core.
Apple core?
Jesus Christ, Walsh. That's what you spent your day doing?
Look, you tell me to take pictures, I take pictures.
Look, Jake. She gave us Mulwray's real phone number and address.
All she needed for that was the phone book!
No, no. She said not to call, her husband might answer.
So he says you sent them?
Think you can nail Mulvihill? They'll claim you were trespassing.
Yeah?
Yeah. What's wrong with you guys? Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em. We'll make a killing. We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice a week, we'll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives.
Duffy, go over and sit on Mulvihill. Jesus Christ, I didn't tell you to bring the police department with you.
Jake, it's Chinatown. They're all over the place. You oughta know better.
What's that, pal?
Nothing. You got a hell of a way to make a living.
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
Tell me, how many people a week do you foreclose on?
We don't publish a record in the paper, I can tell you that.
Neither do I.
Not exactly.
Lots of fellas do. Tell the little woman they're going on a fishing trip, then shack up with some little twist on the island... she pretty?
I'm going to see a man called Julian Cross. Ever heard of him?
Is the Pope Catholic? Who are you, mister?... I ask because he doesn't see a whole lot of people.
I'm working for his daughter.
That right?... She used to be some looker.
She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.
You must be thinking of a different daughter.
No, he's only got one, I remember her age, I read it in the newspapers when she ran away.
She ran away?
Course, she settled down nicely.
Well, you never know, do you?
That's for sure.
Why'd she run away?
Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
She ran off to Mexico. Rumor was she was knocked up and didn't even know who the father was. Went there to get rid of it.
You don't say?
You must not come here! How many times do I have to tell you? If the film catches fire, runt that you are, you'd go up in a burst of flame...whoosh! And turn into a piece of...
'Cause sometimes you can't find the right place any more and so...well, actually...they stay here. Besides, there are more kisses than you can count.
So I can have these?
What are you doing here?
Signora Maria, don't do that. He's just a kid. And why are you telling fibs? We let him in free. He must have lost the money inside the movie theatre... How much did you have?
Fifty lire...
Alfredo, did you know my father?
'I choose my friends for their looks, and my enemies for their brains...' You're too smart to be my friend. Besides, as I always tell my kids, be careful to pick the right friends!
But you don't have any kids!!!
I told my mother you weren't the one who gave me the films. That it wasn't your fault. But I thought you said the film could catch fire just to scare me. Now that I know, I won't steal any more from you. That's all I wanted to say. I'm going.
Now listen to what I've got to say. I took up this profession when I was ten years old. In those days there weren't these modern machines. The films were silent. The projectors were run by hand, like this, with a crank. And you wound the crank all day long. It was really rough going! If you got tired and slowed down' boom! Everything
Then why don't you want to teach it to me too? Now that there's no more cranking, and it's easier?
Because I don't want to, Toto! This is not a job for you. It's like being a slave. You're always alone. You see the same film over and over again, because you have nothing else to do. And you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. Only on Good Friday are you
Then why don't you change jobs?
Because I'm an idiot. How many other guys in town know how to be a projectionist? None! Only a jerk like me could do it. Besides I wasn't lucky. When I was a kid there was the war! When I grew up, another war! Now it's all different. Times have changed. And you want to be a dope like me? Huh? Answer me!
No...
Good for you, Toto. Good for you... I'm only saying this for your own good... Cooped up in here you die of heat in the summer and of cold in the winter. You breathe in smoke, gas fumes, and earn practically nothing.
But don't you like anything about what you do?
With time...you get used to it. Besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... Then you're happy too. So I've been wasting my breath? You pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want! Get out of here! I don't want to lay eyes
You understand which side the gelatin's on?
Will they really find work in Germany?
Who knows?...It's like an adventure. Hope springs eternal...
It's got to be sent to another town. And if we don't the owner of that movie house gets pissed off.
Any room for me in this Cinema Paradiso?
How's school?
OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, I'11 probably stop going...
Don't do that...Sooner or later you'll be left empty-handed.
Why? What do you mean?
Yes. I want proof.
What'd I tell you? It doesn't catch fire!
Chaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto?
That's right, Modern Times.
I've shown it so many times I know it by heart. The first time I showed it, in 1940, was the Sunday my first wife died. They kept it hidden from me all day so they wouldn't have to close down the movie house. I only found out that night, after the last show. Those are things you never forget... So, Toto, how are
Yes.
What is it, what is it? What's the picture?
Now what can you see?
Nothing, there's nothing. It's all out of focus.
Yes, it's a girl I saw at the station.
Eh! Love...what a mystery! I understand you, Toto...The ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful. Whatever you do, you can't make friends with them. Eh, there's nothing to be done about it! The heavier a man is, the deeper his footprints. And if he's in love, he suffers, because he knows he's up a one-way street. Because love is a meaningless thing when
What you say is wonderful! But sad...
I told you, the blue-eyed ones are the most difficult.
But why? There must be some way to make her understand!
Stop it! I've had enough of your sermons! You act as if you created the world!
Heeey! Totooooo! Don't get pissed off with me now! Come here! I don't know where the fuck I have to go. And the next time be careful how you talk. Not to take credit away from the Lord, but if I had created the world, in all modesty, certain things would have come out better. But unfortunately such was not the case.
You see, it s like I say. You always have an answer for everything.
I want to make you happy, Toto! I'm going to tell you a story. Once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm. Basta, one of the guards, saw the king's daughter: she was the loveliest of all! And he immediately fell in love with her. But what could a poor soldier do
Toto, are you pulling my leg or something? How is it possible to see this television without film?
Just so, Alfredo. There isn't any. And if you buy a television set, you can watch it at home, without any fuss...
You weren't expecting me?
No, Alfredo, I was coming to help you...
But where'd you go, Toto?!!
I'm here! Take it easy! Take it easy! Sit down, sit down... Did she come?
You 're thinner...You can tell you've not been treated well. .
They tell me you never go out, never talk to anybody. Why?
Did you ever see her again?
No. And nobody knows where she is.
Listen to this one...The commander says to the sergeant: 'You remember that windmill that used to be there?' 'Yes, sir, I remember the mill's gone but the wind's still there!' You remember the story of the soldier and the princess?
Now I understand why the soldier went away just before the end. That's right, just one more night and the princess would have been his. But she, also, could not have kept her promise. And...that would have been terrible, he would have died from it. So instead, for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for
Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away! This land is cursed. When you're here every day you feel like you're at the center of the universe, it seems like nothing ever changes. Then you go away, one year, two...And when you come back, everything's different. The thread has broken. You don't find those you were looking for, your things no longer exist. Isn't that
Who said that? Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh?
Thanks for all you've done for me.
Good morning, father. It's hard on the feet, huh?
What is it, Alfredo? Right now, of all times!
But Alfredo, what you're saying is horrifying!
You understand now? You see it clearly?
Oh yes, father. Now everything's clear.
My name's Salvatore...And yours?
Hi, Elena!
Hi. Why are you running?
No particular reason... Nice day, huh?
Yes, nice day. ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.
Father, I have sinned...
We'll talk about that later.
But...who...
I don't care. I'll wait.
For what?
You have a great future as a driver. If they don't arrest you first!!
Elena!...But when...
So what'd they say?
No, Salvatore. You'd better go. It's my father.
Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time.
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
Who?
You're still beautiful...
Don't be silly...I'm old. Don't look at me like that, please. Why'd you come back?
Alfredo died. Do you remember him?
I saw your daughter. She's beautiful! Who knows how many Salvatores must be running after her...
One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores. I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
No. And I'm not married. Are you happy?
My husband...you know him.
Sure, sure! Boccia... What's he do?
But I've never forgotten you, Elena!
It's the first time I've had to chance to tell the story. I never mentioned it to anybody.
Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell on you too!
Oh, how I looked for you, Elena! You'll never know. I wrote, telephoned, nothing. Nobody ever answered. But I dreamt of you for years! That's why I went away...and never came back here. Even as the years passed, in all the women I met, I was only looking for you. I had success it's true, but there was always something missing... I'd never have
But I never saw that note! I must have covered it with my hand, without realizing it, that's the only explanation...
No, Salvatore...there is no future. There's only the past. Even meeting last night was nothing but a dream, a beautiful dream. We never did it when we were kids, remember? Now that it's happened, I don't think there could have been a better ending.
I don't remember him any moreMa, where's Russia?
I've been looking for you all day. Did you buy the milk?
No...
Then where's the money?
Daddy's not coming back...He's dead.
Lia'll be so glad to see you, you'll see. And you won't recognize the kids any more, they're grown up by now.
See how pretty the house is? We did everything over. If it hadn't been for you! Come, I have a surprise.... You must be tired. If you want to rest, there's time before the funeral.
No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by air, you know.
No...It's nothing to do with you. It's just that I was scared of coming back. Now, after all these years, I thought I was strong, that I had forgotten lots of things. Instead, I find it's quite the opposite, as if I had never left. And yet, I look at Lia and feel as if I didn't know her, and you, Mamma...I abandoned you,
And I never asked for one! You have nothing to explain. I always thought that what you did was right, and that was that. With no beating around the bush... Only one thing made me suffer: bolting the door shut before going to bed at night...
Don Ciccio, I've got an idea...You remember that old abandoned movie house where they're supposed to build those low-rent houses?
So what's that got to do with it?
The projector's all rusty, but I could fix it in two or three days. Give the place a good cleaning, put in some seats and bring in a projectionist and we'll show Catene in two houses.
Toto, this is no film for the common herd. One day'll be more than enough...So tonight, please set up tomorrow's film, so the projectionist who is coming will find it ready.
How long's it been shut?
But why do you call me 'Mr. Di Vita'? It didn't used to be that way...
Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Thatcher -
That's all right. We have no secrets from our readers. Mr. Thatcher is one of our most devoted readers, Mr. Bernstein. He knows what's wrong with every issue since I've taken charge. What's the cable?
That's fine, Mr. Kane.
He sure did, Mr. Kane.
Mr. Kane -
Hey, Brad! Brad! He ain't been drinking before, Mr. Kane. Never. We would have heard.
"Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty but hopelessly incompetent amateur - - last night opened the new Chicago Opera House in a performance of - of -" I can't pronounce that name, Mr. Kane.
"Her singing, happily, is no concern of this department. Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to..."
Go on!
Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that it represents a new low... Have you got that, Mr. Bernstein? In the opinion of this reviewer -
I didn't see that.
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein. I'm dictating it.
I can't take shorthand.
I've just made a shocking discovery. The "Enquirer" is without a telephone. Have two installed at once!
Three cents.
This is all figured at three cents a copy.
Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
All right, but I'll keep these figures, too, just in case.
Ready for dinner, Brad?
It's a saying, Mr. Bernstein. A new broom sweeps clean.
My Declaration of Principles - Don't smile, Brad - Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein -
I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -
You don't wanta make any promises, Mr. Kane, you don't wanta keep.
Let's hope they like it there.
From the Chronicle Building that sign is the biggest thing you can see - every floor guaranteed - let's hope it bothers them - it cost us enough.
Say, with them fellows - - it's no trick to get circulation.
You're right, Mr. Bernstein.
You know how long it took the "Chronicle" to get that staff together? Twenty years.
Gentlemen of the "Enquirer"! This has, I think, been a fitting welcome to those distinguished journalists - Mr. Reilly in particular - who are the latest additions to our ranks. It will make them happy to learn that the "Enquirer's" circulation this morning passed the two hundred thousand mark.
But please, Mr. Kane, don't buy any more paintings. Nine Venuses already we got, twenty-six Virgins - two whole warehouses full of stuff -
Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein.
So then, tonight, we go over everything thoroughly, eh? Especially the new papers -
We certainly do. Vacation's over - starting right after dinner. But right now - that lady over there - - that's the new society editor, I take it? You think I could interrupt her a moment, Mr. Bernstein?
It's wonderful, Mr. Kane. Wonderful. Wonderful.
You don't really think so?
I do. I do. I mean, since you're running for Governor - and you want to be elected - I think it's wonderful you're going to be elected. Only - - Can I say something?
Please, Mr. Bernstein.
Go in and ask him to hurry.
Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein? You know Mr. Leland.
I might make him nervous.
You and Leland and Mr. Kane - you were great friends back in the old days, I understand.
He's a great guy - Leland. Why'd he ever leave New York?
Yes. I thought it was a good idea. We've covered it from the news end, of course.
And the social. How about the music notice? You got that in?
Oh, yes, it's already made up. Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.
Enthusiastic?
Yes, very! Naturally.
Who's a busy man? Me? I'm Chairman of the Board. I got nothing but time ... What do you want to know?
Well, Mr. Bernstein, you were with Mr. Kane from the very beginning -
From before the beginning, young fellow. And now it's after the end. Anything you want to know about him - about the paper -
- We thought maybe, if we can find out what he meant by that last word - as he was dying -
That Rosebud? Maybe some girl? There were a lot of them back in the early days, and -
Not some girl he knew casually and then remembered after fifty years, on his death bed -
You're pretty young, Mr. - Mr. Thompson. A fellow will remember things you wouldn't think he'd remember. You take me. One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on a ferry and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in - - and on it, there was a girl waiting to get off. A white dress she had on
I'm calling on people who knew Mr. Kane. I'm calling on you.
Who else you been to see?
Well, I went down to Atlantic City -
Susie? I called her myself the day after he died. I thought maybe somebody ought to... She couldn't even come to the 'phone.
You know why? She was so -
Sure, sure.
I'm going back there.
Who else did you see?
Nobody else, but I've been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher's. That journal of his -
Thatcher! That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
He made an awful lot of money.
He finished it. He wrote the worst notice I ever read about the girl he loved. We ran it in every paper.
I guess Mr. Kane didn't think so well of Susie's art anyway.
He thought she was great, Mr. Thompson. He really believed that. He put all his ambition on that girl. After she came along, he never really cared for himself like he used to. Oh, I don't blame Susie -
Well, then, how could he write that roast? The notices in the Kane papers were always very kind to her.
The way things turned out, I don't need to tell you - Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud!
It didn't end very well, did it?
It ended - Then there was Susie - that ended, too. I guess he didn't make her very happy - You know, I was thinking - that Rosebud you're trying to find out about -
Yes -
Maybe that was something he lost. Mr. Kane was a man that lost - almost everything he had - You ought to talk to Bradford Leland. He could tell you a lot. I wish I could tell you where Leland is, but I don't know myself. He may be out of town somewhere - he may be dead.
In case you'd like to know, Mr. Bernstein, he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital on 180th Street.
You don't say! Why I had no idea -
Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me. Just -
I'm not guaranteeing a thing, Mr. Bernstein. You people work too fast for me! Talk about new brooms!
We'll be on the street soon, Charlie - another ten minutes.
Wasted?
Charlie?!
Sixty-two thousand -
Do you, Mr. Leland?
Isn't it wonderful? Such a party!
What's the matter?
Mr. Bernstein, these men who are now with the "Enquirer" - who were with the "Chronicle" until yesterday - weren't they just as devoted to the "Chronicle" kind of paper as they are now to - our kind of paper?
Do we stand for the same things that the "Chronicle" stands for, Mr. Bernstein?
Certainly not. So what's that got to do with it? Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week.
Do you, Mr. Leland?
Mr. Leland, why didn't you go to Europe with him? He wanted you to. He said to me just yesterday -
Mr. Bernstein, I wish you'd let me ask you a few questions, and answer me truthfully.
Don't I always? Most of the time?
Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite? Am I a New England school-marm?
If you thought I'd answer different from what Mr. Kane tells you - well, I wouldn't.
Well, he'll be coming back in September. The Majestic. I got the reservations. It gets in on the ninth.
What's happened?
If you hadn't come along and protected me when you did, I'd have killed them fellows.
Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein. There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
Not to me. But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you?
Hello, Mr. Leland.
Where is it - where's my notice? I've got to finish it!
Mr. Kane is finishing it.
I suppose he's fixing it up - I know I'd never get that through.
Welcome, Mr. Kane, to the "Enquirer." I am Herbert Carter.
Thank you, Mr Carter. This is Mr. Leland.
How do you do, Mr. Leland?
Are they standing for me?
I thought it would be a nice gesture - the new publisher -
Ask them to sit down.
You may resume your work, gentlemen. I didn't know your plans and so I was unable to make any preparations.
Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein. Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.
How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?
My little sanctum is at your disposal. But I don't think I understand -
I'm going to live right here. As long as I have to.
But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane. After all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices -
I'm not criticizing, Mr. Carter, but here's what I mean. There's a front page story in the "Chronicle," and a picture - of a woman in Brooklyn who is missing. Probably murdered. A Mrs. Harry Silverstone. Why didn't the "Enquirer" have that this morning?
I'm still hungry, Brad. Let's go to Rector's and get something decent. The "Chronicle" has a two-column headline, Mr. Carter. Why haven't we?
There is no news big enough.
If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough. The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -
As a matter of fact, we sent a man to the Silverstone home yesterday afternoon. Our man even arrived before the "Chronicle" reporter. And there's no proof that the woman was murdered - or even that she's dead.
The "Chronicle" doesn't say she's murdered, Mr. Carter. It says the neighbors are getting suspicious.
It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives. If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily -
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter. Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone. Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested. Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr.
But, Mr. Kane -
I've been a newspaperman my whole life and I don't intend - - if it's your intention that I should continue to be harassed by this - this - I warn you, Mr. Kane, it would go against my grain to desert you when you need me so badly - but I would feel obliged to ask that my resignation be accepted.
It is accepted, Mr. Carter, with assurances of my deepest regard.
Mr. Kane, this is a surprise!
Was the show covered by every department?
Exactly according to your instructions, Mr. Kane. We've got two spreads of pictures.
And the notice?
Yes - Mr. Kane.
Is it good?
But there's another one still to come - the dramatic notice.
It isn't finished?
No, Mr. Kane.
That's Leland, isn't it?
Yes, Mr. Kane.
Has he said when he'll finish?
We haven't heard from him.
The nurse has complete instructions, but if you care to talk to me at any time, I should be only too glad - I shall be here in the morning.
Thank you. I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly mistake. The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle - I suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her.
I'm sure that's it.
There are no objections to my staying here with her, are there?
Not at all. I'd like the nurse to be here, too.
How do you do? I came here - and I made Mr. Kane come with me... because I recieved this note -
Maybe you can do it and maybe you can't, Mr. Kane.
Let him finish, Charles.
I'm protecting myself every way I know how, Mrs. Kane. This last week, I finally found out how I can stop your husband from being elected. If the people of this state learn what I found out this week, he wouldn't have a chance to - he couldn't be elected Dog Catcher. Well, what I'm interested in is seeing that he's not elected. I
What story, Mr. Rogers?
You don't have to show me anything, Mr. Rogers. I believe you.
Hello, Brad -
I'm sorry I sent for you, Brad - I didn't -
Almost two to one -
I'm surprised he got the votes he did.
Emily!
Why should anyone vote for him? He's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. Children - to be told one thing one day, something else the next, as the whim seizes him. And they're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him - because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel
Emily, you're being - a little unfair - You know what I think of Charles' behavior - about your personal lives -
There aren't any personal lives for people like us. He made that very clear to me nine years ago - If I'd thought of my life with Charles as a personal life, I'd have left him then -
I know that, Emily -
Maybe I should have - the first time he showed me what a mad dog he really was.
Emily, you -
Brad, I'm - I'm not an old woman yet -
I know it is, Brad -
He's paying for it, Emily. Those returns tonight - he's finished. Politically - - socially, everywhere, I guess. I don't know about the papers, but -
What do you expect me to do? What in the world -
They won't do anything to Junior, darling. Anonymous letter writers - I've got guards in front of the house, and I'm going to arrange -
Have they heard from father yet? Has he seen -
Here I am, darling... Darling!... Darling, it's all right... Mother's here.
Emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me.
I'm sending Junior home in the car, Charles - with Oliver -
But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.
There's a call I want you to make with me, Charles.
It can wait.
What's this all about, Emily? I've had a very tiring day and -
I intend to find out.
I insist on being told exactly what you have in mind.
Oh!!
You don't think I'm going to let this blackmailer intimidate me, do you?
I don't see what else you can do, Charles. If he's right - and the papers publish this story he has -
Oh, they'll publish it all right. But that's not going to stop me -
Charles, this - this story - doesn't concern only you. I'll be in it, too, won't I? And Junior?
I suppose so, but - I'm not afraid of the story. You can't tell me that the voters of this state -
Oh yes, there is.
I don't think so. Are you coming, Charles?
There's only one person in the world to decide what I'm going to do - and that's me. And if you think - if any of you think -
You decided what you were going to do, Charles - some time ago. You can't always have it your own way, regardless of anything else that may have happened. Come on, Charles.
Charles, if you don't listen to reason, it may be too late -
I can't tell you the things he said, Charlie. You haven't got any idea -
You can't blackmail me, Rogers, you can't -
Charlie, you're just excited. You don't realize -
Get out, both of you!
Charlie, please don't -
Ow!
What's the matter with you?
Toothache.
You've got some on your face.
What's funny now?
Oh!
You're no Venus de Milo.
If you want to come in and wash your face - I can get you some hot water to get that dirt off your trousers -
Hey, you should be more careful. That's my ma and pa.
I'm sorry. They live here, too?
Where's the soap?
You're very easily amused.
Oh!
I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.
Where's the towel?
On the chiffonier. Here.
Thanks.
I've got a brush in the closet. As soon as the mud on your trousers is all dry - you just brush it off.
A chicken?
No. But you're close.
A rooster?
You're getting farther away all the time. It's a duck.
Excuse me, Mr. Kane. I know this takes a lot of nerve, but - who are you? I mean - I'm pretty ignorant, I guess you caught on to that -
You really don't know who I am?
No. That is, I bet it turns out I've heard your name a million times, only you know how it is -
But you like me, don't you? Even though you don't know who I am?
You've been wonderful! I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and -
And I know too many people. Obviously, we're both lonely. Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes?
I didn't run into you and I bet they're not your Sunday clothes. You've probably got a lot of clothes.
Who am I? Well, let's see. Charles Foster Kane was born in New Salem, Colorado in eighteen six - I run a couple of newspapers. How about you?
Oh, me -
How old did you say you were?
I didn't say.
I didn't think you did. If you had, I wouldn't have asked you again, because I'd have remembered. How old?
Pretty old. I'll be twenty-two in August.
That's a ripe old age - What do you do?
I work at Seligman's.
Is that what you want to do?
I want to be a singer. I mean, I didn't. Mother did for me.
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
Yes -
As a matter of fact, I do sing a little.
Would you sing for me?
Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.
Yes, I would. That's why I asked.
Well, I -
Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again?
Oh, no, that's all gone.
I couldn't make you see how I felt, Charlie. I just couldn't - I couldn't go threw with singing again. You don't know what it means to feel - to know that people - that an audience don't want you. That if you haven't got what they want - a real voice - they just don't care about you. Even when they're polite -
Charlie! I said, what time is it?
Half past eleven.
I mean in New York.
Half past eleven.
At night?
Yes. The bulldog's just gone to press.
Hurray for the bulldog! Half past eleven! The shows have just let out. People are going to night clubs and restaurants. Of course, we're different. We live in a palace - at the end of the world.
You always said you wanted to live in a palace.
It makes a whole lot more sense than collecting Venuses.
You may be right - I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -
It's not a habit. I do it because I like it.
I was referring to myself. I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow - it might be a nice change after the Wild West party tonight. Invite everybody to go to the Everglades -
I mean it. Oh, I know I always say I mean it, and then I don't - or you get me so I don't do what I say I'm going to - but -
You're in a tent, darling. You're not at home. And I can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice.
I'm not going to have my guests insulted, just because you think - - if people want to bring a drink or two along on a picnic, that's their business. You've got no right -
I've got more than a right as far as you're concerned, Susan.
Oh, I'm sick and tired of you telling me what I must and what I musn't do!
You're my wife, Susan, and -
I'm not just your wife, I'm a person all by myself - or I ought to be. I was once. Sometimes you get me to believing I never was.
We can discuss all this some other time, Susan. Right now -
I'll discuss what's on my mind when I want to. You're not going to keep on running my life the way you want it.
As far as you're concerned, Susan, I've never wanted anything - I don't want anything now - except what you want.
What you want me to want, you mean. What you've decided I ought to have - what you'd want if you were me. But you've never given me anything that -
Susan, I really think -
Oh, I don't mean the things you've given me - that don't mean anything to you. What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at? It's only money. It doesn't mean anything. You're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care
Susan, I want you to stop this. And right now!
Well, I'm not going to stop it. I'm going to say exactly what I think. You've never given me anything. You've tried to buy me into giving you something. You're - - it's like you were bribing me! That's what it's been from the first moment I met you. No matter how much it cost you - your time, your money - that's what
You're talking an incredible amount of nonsense, Susan. Whatever I do - I do - because I love you.
You'll never have another chance to hit me again. I never knew till this minute -
Susan, it seems to me -
Don't tell me you're sorry.
I'm not sorry.
I'm going to leave you.
No, you're not.
Don't you realize that everybody here is going to know about this? That you've packed your bags and ordered the car and -
I won't let you go.
Goodbye, Charlie.
Don't go, Susan.
Let's not start all over again, Charlie. We've said everything that can be said.
She doesn't know, Mrs. Kane. She just sent it - because I made her see it wouldn't be smart for her not to send it.
In case you don't know, Emily, this - this gentleman - is -
Anything you say, Mr. Kane. Only we're talking now about what you are. That's what the note is about, Mrs. Kane. Now I'm going to lay all my cards on the table. I'm fighting for my life. Not just my political life. My life. If your husband is elected governor -
You do anything you want to do. The people of this state can decide which one of us to trust. If you want to know, they've already decided. The election Tuesday'll be only -
You're making a bigger fool of yourself than I thought you would, Mr. Kane. You're licked. Why don't you -
Get out! I've got nothing to talk to you about. If you want to see me, have the Warden write me a letter.
You're the greatest fool I've ever known, Kane. If it was anybody else, I'd say what's going to happen to you would be a lesson to you. Only you're going to need more than one lesson. And you're going to get more than one lesson.
It is the unanimous opinion of my Cabinent - in which I concur - that the proposed leases are in the best interests of the Governement and the people. You are not, I hope, suggesting that these interests are not indentical?
I'm not suggesting anything, Mr. President! I've come here to tell you that, unless some action is taken promptly - and you are the only one who can take it - the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks!
I must refuse to allow you to continue in this vein, Mr. Kane.
It's the only vein I know. I tell the facts the way I see them. And any man that knows that facts -
I know the facts, Mr. Kane. And I happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean. You're a man of great talents, Mr. Kane.
Thanks.
I understand that you have political ambitions. Unfortunately, you seem incapable of allowing any other opinion but your own -
I'm much obliged, Mr. President, for your concern about me. However, I happen to be concerned at this moment with the matter of extensive oil lands belonging to the people of the United States, and I say that if this lease goes through, the property of the people of the United States goes into the hands of -
Impossible! Impossible!
Your job isn't to give Mrs. Kane your opinion of her talents. You're supposed to train her voice. Nothing more.
But, it is impossible. I will be the laughingstock of the musical world! People will say -
If you're interested in what people say, Signor Matisti, I may be able to enlighten you a bit. The newspapers, for instance. I'm an authority on what the papers will say, Signor Matisti, because I own eight of them between here and San Francisco... It's all right, dear. Signor Matisti is going to listen to reason. Aren't you, maestro?
Mr. Kane, how can I persuade you -
You goin', Mom?
Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -
Is that really your idea of how to run a newspaper?
I don't know how to run a newspaper, Mr. Thatcher. I just try everything I can think of.
"Enemy Armada Off Jersey Coast." You know you haven't the slightest proof that this - this armada - is off the Jersey Coast.
You see! There hasn't been a true word -
I came to see you, Charles, about your - about the Enquirer's campaign against the Metropolitan Transfer Company.
Mr. Thatcher, isn't everything I've been saying in the Enquirer about the traction trust absolutely true?
They're all part of your general attack - your senseless attack - on everything and everybody who's got more than ten cents in his pocket. They're -
As Charles Foster Kane, who has eighty- two thousand, six hundred and thirty-one shares of Metropolitan Transfer - you see, I do have a rough idea of my holdings - I sympathize with you. Charles Foster Kane is a dangerous scoundrel, his paper should be run out of town and a committee should be formed to boycott him. You may, if you can form
Charles, my time is too valuable for me -
I happened to see your consolidated statement yesterday, Charles. Could I not suggest to you that it is unwise for you to continue this philanthropic enterprise - this Enquirer - that is costing you one million dollars a year?
Get Dr. Corey.
Mrs. Kane would like to see you, Mr. Kane.
Is Mrs. Kane -
Close the door, Raymond.
Yes, sir.
Raymond -
Do you like poetry, Raymond?
Can't say, sir.
Yes, Mr. Kane.
Oh, yes, sir.
Do you know what that is?
It's a wall you bought in China, Mr. Kane.
Persia. It belonged to a king.
How did you get him to part with it, Mr. Kane?
He was dead... That's a poem. Do you know what it means?
No, I don't, Mr. Kane.
Poor Mr. Carter!
Tired?
It's been a tough day.
I've changed the front page a little, Mr. Bernstein. That's not enough - There's something I've got to get into this paper besides pictures and print - I've got to make the "New York Enquirer" as important to New York as the gas in that light.
That's the second sentence you've started with "I" -
The "Chronicle" is a good newspaper.
Well, gentlemen, are we going to war?
Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.
It'll be our first foreign war in fifty years, Brad. We'll cover it the way the "Hickville Gazette" covers the church social! The names of everybody there; what they wore; what they ate; who won the prizes; who gave the prizes - I tell you, Brad, I envy you. By Bradford Leland, the "Enquirer's" Special Correspondent at the Front. I'm almost tempted -
But there is no Front, Charlie. There's a very doubtful civil war. Besides, I don't want the job.
Charles, I tell you there is no war! There's a condition that should be remedied - but between that and a -
How would the "Enquirer" look with no news about this non-existent war - with Benton, Pulitzer and Heart devoting twenty columns a day to it?
They do it only because you do!
Say, Brad. I've got an idea.
Yes?
I mean I've got a job for you.
Good.
You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
You start tomorrow night. Richard Carl in "The Spring Chicken." I'll get us some girls. You get tickets. A drama critic gets them free, you know. Rector's at seven?
Charlie -
Yes?
It doesn't make any difference about me, but one of these days you're going to find out that all this charm of yours won't be enough -
Take dictation - Front page editorial - "This afternoon a great man was assassinated. He was the President of the United States -"
Charlie -
Yes?
Do you think you're the one who should call him a great man?
Why not?
What do you mean by that?
Yesterday morning you called the President a traitor. What do you think that crowd is doing down there? They think you murdered him.
Because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the "Enquirer" in his pocket?
- and that copy of the "Enquirer" said the President should be killed.
I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -
You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.
They're true! Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!
Charlie!
Oil belonging to the people of the United States was leased out for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks - Nobody can blame me because -
There are the people of the United States, and they are blaming you - Oh, I know it doesn't make any sense, but at least you can learn a lesson from it.
What lesson? Not to expose fraud when I see it? Not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property? Run it the way I said, Reilly - "This afternoon a great man was assassinated -"
Charlie! Now you're not making sense.
I don't have to. I run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. I can't help that. Besides, they all know I'm married to his niece. I've got to think of her.
What?
I've got to think of Emily -
I'd like to talk to you about that.
First of all -
What's wrong, Brad?
I'm drunk.
First of all, I will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the "Enquirer."
Charlie, it's just no go. We can't agree anymore. I wish you'd let me go to Chicago.
Why, Brad?
I'll tell you what I'll do, Brad - I'll get drunk, too - maybe that'll help.
All right.
She's going to leave you -
I don't think so, Brad. We've just had word that the President is out of danger. It seems I didn't kill him after all.
Emily's going south next week with the child. As far as anybody's to know, it's a holiday. When they get back -
Brad, you are drunk.
Sure I am. She wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. If you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the President's wishes. I can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong -
Why is she leaving me?
She hasn't any friends left sine you started this oil business, and she never sees you.
Do you think the "Enquirer" shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases?
There's no reason why this - this savage personal note -
The personal note is all there is to it. It's all there ever is to it. It's all there every is to anything! Stupidity in our government, complacency and self-satisfaction and unwillingness to believe that anything done by a certain class of people can be wrong - you can't fight those things impersonally. They're not impersonal crimes against people. They're being done by actual
You talk about the people of the United States as though they belonged to you. When you find out they don't think they are, you'll lose interest. You talk about giving them their rights as though you could make a present of liberty. Remember the working man? You used to defend him quite a good deal. Well, he's turning into something called organized labor
Are you finished?
Yes. Now, will you let me go to Chicago?
You're not going to like it in Chicago. They wind comes howling in from the lake. And there's practically no opera season at all - and the Lord only knows whether they've ever heard of Lobster Newburg -
That's all right. What are you going to do about Emily?
You want love on your own terms, don't you, Charlie - Love according to your own rules. And if anything goes wrong and you're hurt - then the game stops, and you've got to be soothed and nursed, no matter what else is happening - and no matter who else is hurt!
She can leave me. As a matter of fact, I've already left her. Don't worry, Brad - I'll live.
I know you will.
You still want to be transferred to the other paper?
Yes.
Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York. It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth.
Hello, Brad.
Maybe we'd better wait for more word on the President's condition.
We'll withdraw support completely. Anything else?
Mr. Leland sent back that check.
What check?
You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago.
Oh, yes, the bonus.
It does seem too good to be true, doesn't it, Mr. Bernstein?
Rogers isn't even pretending. He isn't just scared anymore. He's sick. Frank Norris told me last night he hasn't known Rogers to be that worried in twenty-five years.
I'll sign those papers -
It's going to be done exactly the way I've told Mr. Thatcher -
Well, let's hope it's all for the best.
Mr. Thatcher is going to take you on a trip with him tonight, Charles. You'll be leaving on Number Ten.
You're going to live with Mr. Thatcher from now on, Charlie! You're going to be rich. Your Ma figures - that is, er - she and I have decided that this isn't the place for you to grow up in. You'll probably be the richest man in America someday and you ought to -
Sorry, Mr. Thatcher! What the kid needs is a good thrashing!
That's what you think, is it, Jim?
Mr. Leland, you were -
You don't happen to have a cigar, do you? I've got a young physician - must remember to ask to see his license - the odds are a hundred to one he hasn't got one - who thinks I'm going to stop smoking... I changed the subject, didn't I? Dear, dear! What a disagreeable old man I've become. You want to know what I
Sorry, Mr. Leland.
Never mind - Bernstein told you about the first days at the office, didn't he? Well, Charlie was a bad newspaper man even then. He entertained his readers, but he never told them the truth.
Maybe you could remember something that -
What's this?
It's a letter from her lawyers.
David, Grobleski & Davis - My dear Rawlston -
Rawlston is my boss.
Oh, yes. I know about Mr. Rawlston.
He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially - That's the answer we got.
Brief marriage! Ten years!
Was he in love?
Well, that's about all there is - and I'm getting chills. Hey, nurse! Five years ago, he wrote from that place of his down South - - you know. Shangri-la? El Dorado? Sloppy Joe's? What's the name of that place? You know... All right. Xanadu. I knew what it was all the time. You caught on, didn't you?
Yes.
I guess maybe I'm not as hard to see through as I think. Anyway, I never even answered his letter. Maybe I should have. I guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years. He hadn't finished it when she left him - he never finished it - he never finished anything. Of course, he built it for her -
That must have been love.
I don't know. He was disappointed in the world. So he built one of his own - An absolute monarchy - It was something bigger than an opera house anyway - Nurse! Say, I'll tell you one thing you can do for me, young fellow.
Sure.
On your way out, stop at a cigar store, will you, and send me up a couple of cigars?
Sure, Mr. Leland. I'll be glad to.
I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.
I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.
Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?
Charles, my name is Mr. Thatcher -
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
Yeah, all in crates.
There's a part of a Scotch castle over there, but we haven't bothered to unwrap it.
Anything and everything - he was a regular crow.
Or Rosebud? How about it, Jerry?
Turn that thing off, will you? It's driving me nuts! What's Rosebud?
Yes, and maybe he didn't.
Ask the question anyway, Thompson! Build the picture around the question, even if you can't answer it.
I know, but -
Thompson!
Yes, sir.
Hold this thing up for a week. Two weeks if you have to...
But don't you think if we release it now - he's only been dead four days - it might be better than if -
I'll get to it right away, Mr. Rawlston.
Yes, sir - yes, sir, I knew how to handle the old man. He was kind of queer, but I knew how to handle him.
Queer?
That's the whole works, right up to date.
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?
Yes and no.
Well, thanks a lot.
You can go on asking questions if you want to.
What do you think all that is worth, Mr. Thompson?
Millions - if anybody wants it.
The banks are out of luck, eh?
Who told you you could sit down here?
Oh! I thought maybe we could have a drink together?
Why don't you people let me alone? I'm minding my own business. You mind yours.
If you'd just let me talk to you for a little while, Miss Alexander. All I want to ask you...
How do you want to handle the whole thing - ask questions?
I'd rather you just talked. Anything that comes into your mind - about yourself and Mr. Kane.
How did you meet him?
I did a lot of singing after that. I sang for Charlie - I sang for teachers at a hundred bucks an hour - the teachers got that, I didn't -
What did you get?
I didn't get a thing. Just the music lessons. That's all there was to it.
He married you, didn't he?
He was in love with me. But he never told me so until after it all came out in the papers about us - and he lost the election and that Norton woman divorced him.
What about that apartment?
In case you've never heard of how I lost all my money - and it was plenty, believe me -
The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people.
They haven't been tough on me. I just lost my money. But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him -
I feel kind of sorry for him, all the same -
Don't you think I do? You say you're going down to Xanadu?
Monday, with some of the boys from the office. Mr. Rawlston wants the whole place photographed carefully - all that art stuff. We run a picture magazine, you know -
Right away. Will you have something, Mr. Thompson?
She's just not talking to anybody from the newspapers, Mr. Thompson.
She's plastered, isn't she?
She'll snap out of it. Why, until he died, she'd just as soon talk about Mr. Kane as about anybody. Sooner.
I'll come down in a week or so and see her again. Say, you might be able to help me. When she used to talk about Kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about Rosebud?
Are you sure?
Am I sure?
Are you sure?
Am I sure about what?
Do you really want to buy those cigarettes?
Are you serious?
How long have you been smoking?
I'd say you're about nineteen, twenty, am I right?
What the hell is that?
That's your lung. By this time, your lung looks like this.
You're shittin' me.
What's this?
It's a trach ring. It's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box. This one came out of a sixty-year-old man.
Unnhh!
Well, if it's already too late...
It's never too late. Give those cigarettes back now, and buy some gum instead. Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.
It's not the same.
Jesus!
It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it.
Pack of cigarettes. What's that?
Thanks. Have a good one.
Do you mind if I drink this here?
Beats me.
Excuse me, but...
Fifty-five.
Maybe you should take that coffee outside.
No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks.
If you're going to drink it in here, I'd appreciate it if you'd not bother the customers.
Hey, now wait a sec...
Now he's going to launch into his rap about how he's just doing his job; following orders. Friends, let me tell you about another bunch of hate mongers that were just following orders: they were called Nazis, and they practically wiped a nation of people from the Earth... just like cigarettes are doing now! Cigarette smoking is the new Holocaust, and those that partake
I think you'd better leave now.
You want me to leave? Why? Because somebody is telling it like it is? Somebody's giving these fine people a wake-up call?!
You're loitering in here, and causing a disturbance.
That's it, everybody out.
We're not moving! We have a right, a constitutional right, to assemble and be heard!
Yeah, but not in here.
What better place than this? To stamp it out, you gotta start at the source!
Like I'm responsible for all the smokers!
Randal Graves-scourge of the video renter.
Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree!
You saw that article? God, isn't it awful? My mother sent that in.
I take it she likes the guy.
You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching?
Children's programming. What did your mom say when you told her you weren't engaged anymore?
She said not to come home until graduation.
Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?
What can I say? He does weird things to me.
Can I watch?
You can hold me down.
Can I join in?
You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite.
Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around?
A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try.
Wow. Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?
Dick.
Exactly.
So where is he?
He went home to change for the big date.
God, isn't he great?
No, this is great.
Can I use the bathroom?
There's no light back there.
Why aren't there any lights?
Well, there are, but for some reason they stop working at five-fourteen every night.
You're kidding.
Nobody can figure it out. And the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store.
Such a sordid state of affair.
And I'm caught in the middle-torn between my loyalty for the boss, and my desire to piss with the light on.
Hey Caitlin... Break his heart again this time, and I'll kill you. Nothing personal.
You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been.
Territoriality. He was mine first.
Am I missing something here?
I went back there, and Dante was already waiting for me.
He was?
It was so cool. He didn't say a word. He was just... ready, you know? And we didn't kiss or talk or anything. He just sat there and let me do all the work.
I was here the whole time.
Nobody! I swear!
Why?
When did you get back?
Just now.
My God. I haven't seen you since...
I just saw Alyssa's little sister outside. She was with Rick Derris.
Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home?
Train. It took eight hours.
You're just going to lock the store like that?
I want to talk to you about something, and I don't want to be disturbed.
You saw it?
Very dramatic, I thought.
It's not what you think.
What, it's worse? You're pregnant with an Asian design major's child?
I'm not pregnant.
Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation?
I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well, I didn't want to mess it up.
You could've broke it to me gently, you know; at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend. I told you I have a girlfriend.
I know, I'm sorry. But when we started talking... it's like I forgot I had a boyfriend. And then he proposed last month...
And you said yes?
Well... kind of, sort of?
Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is?
I would've told you, and you would have stopped calling, like a baby.
How do you know that?
Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones.
So you're really getting married?
No.
No, you're not really getting married?
The story goes like this: He proposed, and I told him I had to think about it, and he insisted I wear the ring anyway. Then my mother told the paper we were engaged.
How like her.
Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Was I right?
Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even.
I love a macho façade. It's such a turn-on. What smells like shoe polish?
And you came here to what? To comfort me?
The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you.
But you were.
No, I wasn't. Not really. I told you'd I'd been seeing other people.
Yeah, but not seriously. Christ, you're ready to walk down the aisle- I'd say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody.
I'm giving him his ring back.
What?
I don't want to marry him. I don't want to get married now. I'm on the verge of graduation. I want to go to grad school after this. And then I want to start a career. I don't want to be a wife first, and then have to worry about when I'm going to fit in all of the other stuff. I've come way
Sang? His name is a past tense?
Stop it. He's a nice guy.
If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him?
I just told you.
There's more, isn't there?
Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?
Tell me I don't have something to do with it.
You don't have anything to do with it.
You lie.
Look how full of yourself you are.
I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed.
If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major?
Jesus, you're caustic.
I had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on. When I say I don't want to get married, I mean just that. I don't want to marry anybody. Not for years.
So who's asking? I don't want to marry you.
Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
But can we date?
I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.
We could introduce them. They might hit it off.
You're serious. You want to date again.
I would like to be your boyfriend, yes.
It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it.
Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market...
You work in a market, all right.
Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing.
The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date.
So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?
I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.
Let me take you out tonight.
You mean, on a date?
Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.
The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before.
You have a better suggestion?
How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date?
I hear that's a rather popular date.
Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you call me a slut, in so many words.
What about Sing?
Sang.
Sang.
He's not invited.
He's your fiancé.
I offer you my body and you offer me semantics? He's just a boyfriend, Dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why I came all the way here from Ohio, I'm about to become single again. And yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which I'll probably be ostracized at both school and
So what are you saying?
You're such an asshole.
I'm just kidding.
I can already tell this isn't going to work.
I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.
Where'd he go? I'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog.
He went to rent a movie, but he hasn't gotten back yet. Ah, screw it; I'll just lock the store up and leave him a note.
You're too responsible. But no. I have to go home first. They don't even know I left school. And I should break the disengagement news to my mother, which is going to cause quite a row, considering she loves Sang.
Who doesn't?
Well, me I guess. So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you.
What happened to the walk and the nakedness?
How'd you get here so fast?
I left like an hour ago.
Promise me it'll always be like that.
Like what?
When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything.
And the fact that there weren't any lights made it so... God! That was so great!
It wasn't me.
Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?
I'm serious.
We didn't just have sex in the bathroom?
Stop this. This isn't funny.
I'm not kidding. I just got back from outside.
This isn't fucking funny, Dante!
Are you sure somebody was back there?
I can't believe this! I feel faint...
There's a strange man in our bathroom, and he just raped Caitlin!
I don't know. He just came in and asked to use the bathroom.
What time was this?
Wait a second? Who was working here today?
Just me.
I thought you just said you played hockey and went to a funeral.
We did.
Then who operated the store?
Nobody. It was closed.
With this guy locked in?
Was he alive when... Caitlin...
Well he asked me for it!
What about Caitlin?
Shock trauma. She's going to need years of therapy after this. My question is, How did she come to have sex with the dead man?
Are you open?
Yeah.
This is the last time I come to this place.
Excuse me?
Using filthy language in front of the customers... you should both get fired.
We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little carried away.
If you can just wait a few more minutes.
What the fuck is this?! I want some service!
In a second!
Fuck in a second! This is... Look at you! You can't even pass!
I can pass!
Who are you to make assessments?
Like you're better!
That's easy to say from over here.
Are you open?
My point is that you're a clerk, paid to do a job. You can't just do anything you want while you're working.
"Space Alien Revealed as Head of Time Warner; Reports Stock Increase." They print any kind of shit in these papers.
I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR FUCKING HEAD! YOU FUCKING JERKOFF!
Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean it! He was trying to get me.
Well, he missed!
I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even.
Excuse me, do you have...
Pack of cigarettes. Congratulations. I saw that announcement in today's paper. She's marrying an Asian design major.
All right, now if you're really feeling dangerous tonight, then Smokey and the Bandit Three is the movie you must rent.
This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds in it.
Awww, he's so cute. What's his name?
I work in a shitty video store. I want to go to a good video store so I can rent a good movie.
Pack of cigarettes. Cute cat. What's its name?
Pack of cigarettes.
I saw one, one time, that said the world was ending the next week. Then in the next week's paper, they said we were miraculously saved at the zero hour by a Koala-fish mutant bird. Crazy shit.
Cute cat. What's his name.
You open?
What am I worried about? He'll probably be glad I started the ball rolling. All he ever did was complain about her anyway. I'm just looking out for his best interests. I mean, that's what a friend does, am I right? I did him a favor.
Dante, let me grab a Gatorade.
If you grab a Gatorade, then everybody's going to grab one.
So?
So? So nobody's going to want to pay for these Gatorades.
What do you care? Hey, what smells like shoe polish?
I've got a responsibility here. I can't let everybody grab free drinks.
All right. Jesus, you fuckers are pushy.
You only brought one ball?!
Shit!
You're late.
What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one.
The boss called. Arthur fell ill.
Why are the shutters closed?
Someone jammed gum in the locks.
Bunch of savages in this town.
That's what I said.
What time do you have to stay till?
He assured me that he'd be here by twelve.
What smells like shoe polish?
Some guy just came in refusing to pay late fees. He said the store was closed for two hours yesterday. I tore up his membership.
Shocking abuse of authority.
I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class, especially since I rule. Is the Pelican flying?
Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious.
Want something to drink? I'm buying.
No, thanks.
Who was on your phone this morning at about two-thirty? I was trying to call for a half an hour.
Why?
You don't want to know.
You called Caitlin again?
She called me.
Did you tell Veronica?
One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks.
What do you two fight about?
I guess it's not really fighting. She just wants me to leave here, go back to school, get some direction.
I'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree.
You win.
I'm going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been with Veronica for how long now?
Seven months.
Chick's nuts about you. How long did you date Caitlin?
Five years.
Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times?
Eight and a half.
Eight and a half?
Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.
That's cheating?
In the middle of it, she calls me Brad.
She called you Brad?
She called me Brad.
That's not cheating. People say crazy shit during sex. One time, I called this girl "Mom."
I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson.
What do you mean?
She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party.
Oh, my God.
Great story, isn't it?
That girl was vile to you.
Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom?
Your mother.
Allan Harris.
Chess team Allan Harris?!
The two moved to Idaho together after graduation. They raise sheep.
That's frightening.
It takes different strokes to move the world.
In light of this lurid tale, I don't see how you could even romanticize your relationship with Caitlin-she broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles.
Because there was a lot of good in our relationship.
Oh yeah.
I'm serious. Aside from the cheating, we were a great couple. That's what high school's all about-algebra, bad lunch, and infidelity.
You think things would be any different now?
They are. When she calls me now, she's a different person-she's frightened and vulnerable. She's about to finish college and enter the real world. That's got to be scary for anyone.
Oh shit, I've got to place an order.
I'm talking to myself here.
No, no, I'm listening. She's leaving college, and...?
...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.
What about Veronica?
I think the arguments Veronica and I are having are some kind of manifestation of a subconscious desire to break away from her so that I can pursue the possibility of a more meaningful relationship with Caitlin.
Caitlin's on the same wave-length?
I think it's safe to say yes.
Then I think all four of you had better sit down and talk it over.
All four?
Do you know that article is accurate? Caitlin's really getting married!
You know what I just watched?
Me pulling a can off some moron's fist.
Return of the Jedi.
Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married.
Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.
Empire.
Blasphemy.
Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett. It ends on such a down note. And that's life-a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.
What's that?
All right, Vader's boss...
The Emperor.
Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?
How do you mean?
Well, he's like the pope for the dark side of the Force. He's a holy man; a shaman, kind of, albeit an evil one.
I guess.
Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule.
Yeah.
Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.
It would stand to reason, yes.
Hence, the Empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution.
More or less.
The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief.
You know what else I noticed in Jedi?
There's more?
So they build another Death Star, right?
Yeah.
Now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the Rebels destroyed it.
Luke blew it up. Give credit where it's due.
And the second one was still being built when they blew it up.
Compliments of Lando Calrissian.
Something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it. I could never put my finger on it-something just wasn't right.
And you figured it out?
Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army- storm troopers, dignitaries-the only people onboard were Imperials.
Basically.
So when they blew it up, no prob. Evil is punished.
And the second time around...?
The second time around, it wasn't even finished yet. They were still under construction.
So?
A construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the Imperial army had to offer. I'll bet there were independent contractors working on that thing: plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers.
Not just Imperials, is what you're getting at.
Exactly. In order to get it built quickly and quietly they'd hire anybody who could do the job. Do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main? All they know is killing and white uniforms.
All right, so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star, why are you uneasy with its destruction?
You'll never believe what this unruly customer just said...
Wait.
She's in here?
What's he looking for?
He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
Perfect dozen.
Each egg has to be perfect.
The quest isn't going well?
Why doesn't he just mix and match?
What did he say?
He said it was important to have standards. He said nobody has pride anymore.
It's not like you laid the eggs yourself.
Did you ever notice all the prices end in nine? Damn, that's eerie.
You know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour?
What's a jizz-mopper?
He's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off.
Nudie booth?
Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?
Oh, it's great. You step into this little booth and there's this window between you and this naked woman, and she puts on this little show for like ten bucks.
What kind of show?
Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do. These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening in their body... any opening. He's led a very sheltered life.
Can we talk about this later?
Why do you do things like that? You know she's going to come back and tell the boss.
Who cares? That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.
I'm gonna hear it tomorrow.
You gotta loosen up, my friend. You'd feel a hell of a lot better if you'd rip into the occasional customer.
What for? They don't bother me if I don't bother them.
Liar! Tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis.
There aren't.
How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?
It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings.
Let's hear it.
The milkmaids.
The women that go through every gallon of milk looking for a later date. As if somewhere-beyond all the other gallons-is a container of milk that won't go bad for like a decade.
You know who I can do without? I could do without the people in the video store.
Which ones?
No.
Why not?
Because my ex-girlfriend is getting married.
Jesus, you got a one-track mind. It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin...
Thirty-seven!
Can you come next door? I gotta make a phone call.
Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right?
Vermont?
Can you believe this?!
He didn't mention it when he called you this morning?
Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!
So, what-you're stuck here all day?
FUCK!
Why'd you apologize?
What?
I heard you apologize. Why? You have every right in the world to be mad.
I know.
That seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down.
I don't back down.
Yes, you do. You always back down. You assume blame that isn't yours, you come in when called as opposed to enjoying your day off, you buckle like a belt.
You know what pisses me off the most?
The fact that I'm right about your buckling?
I'm going to miss the game.
Because you buckled.
Would you shut the hell up with that shit? It's not helping.
Don't yell at me, pal.
Sorry.
See? There you go again.
I can't believe I'm going to miss the game!
At least we're stuck here together.
Pull my laces tighter.
I've gotta tell you, my friend: this is one of the ballsiest moves I've ever been privy to. I never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy.
I told him I had a game today. It's his own fault.
No argument here. Insubordination rules.
He's blunt, but he's got a point.
Design major.
Are you gonna lock the store?
I don't know. You going to lock the video store?
Look who you're asking here. How're we gonna block off the street?
We're not playing in the street.
Helluva game!
One ball!! They come all the way here... I close the damn store... for one ball!
Hockey's hockey. At least we got to play.
Randal, twelve minutes is not a game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up!
Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink?
What happened to all the Gatorade?
Exactly. They drank it all.
After an exhausting game like that I can believe it.
You know what Sanford told me?
I still can't believe Caitlin's getting married.
Julie Dwyer died.
Yeah, right.
Oh, my god.
Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning.
How? When?
Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.
Jesus.
She was swimming at the YMCA pool when it happened. Died mid-backstroke.
I haven't seen her in almost two years.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve?
Number six.
You've had sex with a dead person.
I'm gonna go to her wake.
No, you're not.
Why not?
It's today.
What!?
Paulsen's Funeral Parlor. The next show is at four.
Shit. What about tomorrow?
One night only. She's buried in the morning.
You've gotta watch the store. I have to go to this.
Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well?
You hardly knew her!
True, but do you know how many people are going to be there? All of our old classmates, to say the least.
Stop it. This is beneath even you.
I'm not missing what's probably going to be the social event of the season.
You hate people.
But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?
Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store.
If you go, I go.
She meant nothing to you!
She meant nothing to you either until I told you she died.
I'm not taking you to this funeral.
I'm going with you.
I can't close the store.
You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof!
You were saying?
She was pretty young, hunhh?
Twenty-two; same as us.
An embolism in a pool.
An embarrassing way to die.
That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died.
How'd he die?
Broke his neck.
That's embarrassing?
Shut the hell up.
Bible truth.
Stop it.
I swear.
Oh, my god.
Come on. Haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick?
No!
Yeah sure. You're so repressed.
Because I never tried to suck my own dick?
No, because you won't admit to it. As if a guy's a fucking pervert because he tries to go down on himself. You're as curious as the rest of us, pal. You've tried it.
Who found him?
My cousin? My aunt found him. On his bed, doubled over himself with his legs on top. Dick in his mouth. My aunt freaked out. It was a mess.
His dick was in his mouth?
Balls resting on his lips.
He made it, hunhh?
I could never reach.
Reach what?
You know.
What, your dick?
Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later.
I know it was a bad idea to close the store.
Listen to you.
I can't help it. At least when we were playing hockey outside, I could see if anyone wanted to go in.
I can't fucking believe you!!
I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes!
I was just leaning on it! It was an accident!
Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
So the casket fell over! Big deal!
Her fucking body fell out!
So they'll put her back in! It's not like it's gonna matter if she breaks something!
Let me borrow your car.
I don't want to talk to you.
Fine. Just lend me your car.
Why should I loan you my car?
I want to rent a movie.
What's that for?
Can you imagine being halfway decent to the customers at least some of the time?
Let me borrow your car.
May I be blunt with you?
If you must.
We are employees of Quick Stop Convenience and RST video, respectively. As such, we have certain responsibilities which-though it may seem cruel and unusual-does include manning our posts until closing.
I see. So playing hockey and attending wakes-these practices are standard operating procedure.
You know what? I don't think I care for your rationale.
So your argument is that title dictates behavior?
What?
The reasons you won't let me borrow your car is because I have a title and a job description, and I'm supposed to follow it, right?
That's stretching it. You're not being asked to slay children or anything.
What the fuck did you do that for?
Two reasons: one, I hate when the people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines.
Jesus!
And two, to make a point: title does not dictate behavior.
What?
If title dictated my behavior, as a clerk serving the public, I wouldn't be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy. But I did, so my point is that people dictate their own behavior. Hence, even though I'm a clerk in this video store, I choose to go rent videos at Big Choice. Agreed?
You're a danger to both the dead and the living.
I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny.
Please, get the hell out of here.
Get to work.
What'd you rent? Best of Both Worlds?
Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see the box: Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame.
And this is what you rented?
I like to expand my horizons.
I got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor.
No way!
Five hundred dollars.
I didn't think they even enforced this.
Living proof.
I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.
I don't; you did.
Really?
Little girl. Maybe five years old?
Holy shit. That girl?
As opposed to the hundreds of other children you let buy cigarettes whenever you work here.
Then how come you got the fine?
Because I'm here.
You're lying.
I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
Because I'm happy.
You're happy?
I'm happy.
You're happy to get a fine?
No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me.
Now I know you're lying.
I'm not. She just left.
What did she say?
She's not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother.
You're kidding.
I'm not.
Wow. You've had quite an evening.
She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
Watch the store while I go home and change.
What happened to title dictates behavior?
This is my way of spitting water at life.
Hey, what about Veronica?
No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word.
You're a snake.
In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns.
You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this?
I might be leaving early to go out with Caitlin, in which case you'll have to close the store tonight.
All right, but you're missing out. Chicks with dicks.
Who eats cock?
Bunch of savages in this town. Hey, Caitlin's in the back. You might want to see if she's okay; she's been back there a long time.
There's no lights back there.
I told her that. She said she didn't need any. Why don't you join her, man. Make a little bathroom bam-bam.
I love your sexy talk. It's so... kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee.
Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium?
You just fucked a total stranger?
She said she did all the work.
Around three or something.
What time did we go to the funeral?
What? What's with you? You haven't said anything for like twenty minutes. What the hell is your problem?
This life.
This life?
Why do I have this life?
Have some chips; you'll feel better.
I'm stuck in this pit, earning less than slave wages, working on my day off, dealing with every backward fuck on the planet, the goddamn steel shutters are locked all day, I smell like shoe polish, I've got an ex- girlfriend who's catatonic after fucking a dead guy, and my present girlfriend has sucked thirty-six dicks.
Thirty-seven.
That's all bullshit. You know what the real problem here is?
You should shit or get off the pot.
I should shit or get off the pot.
Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about this thing you have... this inability to improve your situation in life.
Fuck you.
It's true. You'll sit there and blame life for dealing a cruddy hand, never once accepting the responsibility for the way your situation is.
What responsibility?
All right, if you hate this job and the people, and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, then quit.
As if it's that easy.
It is. You just up and quit. There are other jobs, and they pay better money. You're bound to be qualified for at least one of them. So what's stopping you?
Leave me alone.
You're comfortable. This is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself.
Oh, like your life's any better?
I'm satisfied with my situation for now. You don't hear me bitching. You, on the other hand, have been bitching all day.
Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store?
It's the same thing with Veronica.
Leave her out of this.
You date Veronica because she's low maintenance and because it's convenient. Meanwhile, all you ever do is talk about Caitlin. You carry a torch for a girl you dated in high school-in high school for God's sake! You're twenty-two!
Leave me alone.
If you want Caitlin, then face Veronica, tell her, and be with Caitlin. If you want Veronica, be with Veronica. But don't pine for one and fuck the other. Man, if you weren't such a fucking coward...
...If I wasn't such a fucking coward. It must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do.
Am I right or what?
You're wrong. Things happened today, okay? Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin.
What? The dead guy? She'll get over fucking the dead guy. Shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years; I call him Dad.
Caitlin and I can't be together. It's impossible.
Melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement.
What do you want me to say? Yes, I suppose some of the things you're saying may be true. But that's the way things are; it's not going to change.
Make them change.
I can't, all right! Jesus, would you leave me alone? I can't make changes like that in my life. If I could, I would-but I don't have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes.
Who're you kidding? You can so.
Jesus H. Christ, I can't!
So you'll continue being miserable all the time, just because you don't have the guts to face change?
My mother told me once that when I as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, I chose to shit my pants.
Lovely story.
How's your eye?
The swelling's not so bad. But the FDS stings. How's your neck?
You didn't have to choke me.
Why the fuck did you tell Veronica that I was going to dump her for Caitlin?
I thought I was doing you a favor.
Thanks.
You were saying how you couldn't initiate change yourself, so I figured I'd help you out.
You still didn't have to choke me.
Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't kill you.
Why do you say that?
Why do I say that? Randal... forget it.
No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?
What don't you do? Randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.
How do you figure?
What time did you get to work today?
Like ten after.
You were over half an hour late. Then all you do is come over here.
To talk to you.
Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
It's not like I'm miles away.
Unless you're out renting videos at other video stores.
Hermaphrodites! I rented it so we could watch it together!
You get my slapped with a fine, you fight with the customers and I have to patch everything up. You get us chased out of a funeral by violating a corpse. To top it all off, you ruin my relationship. What's your encore? Do you anally rape my mother while pouring sugar in my gas tank? You know what the real tragedy is? I'm
I threw out the stuff that got broken. The floor looks clean.
You need a ride?
Do you work tomorrow?
Same time. What about you?
I'm calling out. Going to hit the hospital-see how Caitlin is. Then try to see Veronica.
You wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night... after I get out of here?
I'll call you. Let you know.
All right. Good luck with Veronica. If you want, I can talk to her, you know, and explain...
No thanks. I'll take care of it. We've got a lot of shit to talk about.
Helluva day.
To say the least.
Do you need a hug or something? 'Cause I would have no hang-ups about hugging you... you know, you being a guy and all. Just don't knead my ass when you do it.
Get the fuck outta here already.
Are you open?
Yes.
Just the paper.
I'd say about sixty, seventy-tops.
He's got those love handles.
Do I know you?
You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with...
Caitlin Bree. Yeah?
I'm her sister.
You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?
You know him?
I still remember Caitlin telling us about that time you two went to that motel-the one with the mirrors and the hot tub in the room.
I'm surprised you never found out about it, Dante. Everybody in school knew-even in my class.
Sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym.
Excuse me?
I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag. That milk only weighs about seven pounds.
I didn't strain. I sighed.
I don't think so. That was a grunt; a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid in the stretching of muscles. I'm a trainer. I know what that sound signifies: you're out of shape.
I don't think so.
Oh, I do. You made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash. Your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized.
They are not.
Yes, they are. You're out of shape.
What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body.
I am not.
How much can you bench?
Oh for God's sake!
Did you say Caitlin Bree?
Yeah.
Pretty girl, about this girl's height- dark hair-gorgeous body?
Yeah?
And your name is Dante Hicks? You went to high school with her? You played hockey?
How do you know that?
Oh man! Hey, you still going out with her?
No, she's getting married.
What?
Wait a second! You used to sleep with Caitlin Bree? While I was dating her?
All the time. That girl was like a rabbit.
What? When? When did all this shit happen?
But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! Hey!
Are there any balls down there?!
Go open the video store.
Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk.
How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.
Noinch, noinch, noinch-smoking weed, smoking weed! Doing coke! Drinking beers! A pack of wraps, my good man. It's time to kick back, drink some beers, and smoke some weed!
Done poisoning the youth for the day?
Hell yes, whatever that means. Now I'm gonna head over to Atlantic, drink some beers, get ripped, and- please God-get laid. E-Z Wider, one-and-a-halfs.
One seventy-nine.
Pay the good man. Don't you close soon?
A half hour.
We get off about the same time every night. We should hang out. You get high?
I should start.
Wanna come to this party tonight? There's gonna be some pussy there, man!
With you? I don't think so.
Listen to you. Oh shit. "Oh, I don't hang out with drug dealers."
I work, just like you. You're more of a crook than I am, dude.
How do you figure... HEY! You can't roll a joint in here!
Relax brother. What I mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around. A dollar seventy-nine for wraps-what's that shit?
It's not my store.
And these aren't my drugs-I just sell them.
The difference is you exploit a weakness.
What's that mean?
You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction.
All right. How much is Pepsi here?
A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.
At Food City it's ninety-nine cents, plus tax.
So.
So why do you sell it for so much more? I'll tell you why-because people come here and they're like "A dollar eighty for soda? I should get it at Food City. But I don't feel like driving there. I'll just buy it here so I don't have to drive up there." That's exploiting a weakness, too, isn't it?
I can't believe you just rolled a joint in here.
Hey, man, what happened with that old guy?
He died in the bathroom.
That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he was jerkin' off.
I don't know. I wasn't watching.
Probably saw that Caitlin chick. I know I felt like beatin' it when I saw her. Come here, bitch! You like this? Is this what you want? Hunhh?
Knock it off. That used to be my girlfriend.
You used to go out with her?
We were going to start again, I think.
Don't you already have a girlfriend?
Veronica.
Is she that girl who's down here all the time? She came here today carrying a plate of food.
Lasagne.
And what-you were gonna dump her to date that Caitlin chick?
Maybe.
I don't know dude. That Caitlin chick's nice. But I see that Veronica girl doing shit for you all the time. She brings you food, she rubs your back... Didn't I see her change your tire one day?
I jacked the car up. All she did was loosen the nuts and put the tire on.
Damn. She sure goes out of her way.
She's my girlfriend.
I've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit. Shit, my grandma used to say, "Which is better: a good plate with nothing on it..." No, wait. I fucked up. She said "What's a good-looking plate with nothing on it?"
Meaning?
It's not like it's a demanding job. I'd like to get paid to sit on my ass and watch TV. The other day I walked in there and that sonofabitch was sleeping.
I'm sure he wasn't sleeping.
You calling me a liar?
No; he was probably just resting his eyes.
What the hell is that? Resting his eyes! It's not like he's some goddamned air traffic controller!
Actually, that's his night job.
Such a wiseass. But go ahead. Crack wise. That's why you're jockeying a register in some fucking local convenience store instead of doing an honest day's work. I got no more time to bullshit around waiting for that sonofabitch. You make sure this gets back. The number's eight-twelve-Wynarski. And I wanted to get a damn movie, too.
If you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, I'll have him hold it for you.
Be careful.
I'm trying.
You know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer.
So I'm told.
And he got cancer by chewing fluorescent bulb glass...?
No, he got hit by a bus.
Oh... Can I help you?
Well, that depends. Do you have a bathroom?
Um... yeah, but it's for employees only.
I understand, but can I use it. I'm not that young anymore, so I'm kind of... you know... incontinent.
Uh... sure. Go ahead. It's back through the cooler.
Thanks son. Say-what kind of toilet paper you got back there?
The white kind.
I'm not asking about the color. I mean is it rough or cottony?
Actually, it is kind of rough.
Rough, eh? Oh, that stuff rips hell out of my hemorrhoids. Say, would you mind if I took a roll of the soft stuff back there. I see you sell the soft stuff.
Yeah, but...
Aw, c'mon boy. What's the difference? You said yourself the stuff that's there now is rough.
Yeah, okay. Go ahead.
Say, young fella, you know I hate to bother you again, but can I take a paper or something back there... to read? It usually takes me a while, and I like to read while it's going on.
Jesus... go ahead.
You know, you probably could've been home, already, in the time it's taken you to get in there.
Can I trouble you for one of those magazines?
I said go ahead.
The porno mags?
Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make me laugh. They draw the biggest titties.
Here. Now leave me alone.
All right, stupid question. But don't you think you're taking this a bit too hard?
Too hard?! I don't have enough indignities in my life-people start throwing cigarettes at me!
At least they weren't lit.
I hate this fucking place.
Then quit. You should be going to school anyway...
Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point.
All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
I'm not even supposed to be here today!
I know. I stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something.
The guy got sick and couldn't come in.
Don't you have a hockey game at two?
Yes! And I'm going to play like shit because I didn't get a good night's sleep!
Why did you agree to come in then?
I'm only here until twelve, then I'm gone. The boss is coming in.
Why don't you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here?
Somebody jammed the locks with gum.
You're kidding.
Bunch of savages in this town.
You look bushed. What time did you get to bed?
I don't know-like two-thirty, three.
What were you doing up so late?
Hunhh? Nothing.
What were you doing?
Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
What? What is that?
She called you, didn't she?
How much money did you leave up there?
Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.
You're trusting.
Why do you say that?
How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take?
Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched.
Honesty through paranoia. Why do you smell like shoe polish?
I had to use shoe polish to make that sign. The smell won't come off.
Do you think anyone can see us down here?
Why? You wanna have sex or something?
Ooh! Can we?!
Really?
I was kidding.
Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.
Typically male point of view.
How do you figure?
You show some bedroom proficiency, and you think you're gods. What about what we do for you?
Women? Women, as lovers, are all basically the same: they just have to be there.
"Be there?"
Making a male climax is not all that challenging: insert somewhere close and preferably moist; thrust; repeat.
How flattering.
Now, making a woman cum... therein lies a challenge.
Oh, you think so?
A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent.
And I actually date you?
Something wrong?
I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just "being there"-as you put it-is not enough.
I touched a nerve.
I'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life.
It wasn't directed at you. I was making a broad generalization.
You were making a generalization about "broads!"
These are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me.
How many?
How many what?
How many girls have you slept with?
How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once?
We might have; I don't remember. How many?
Including you?
It better be up to and including me.
Twelve.
You've slept with twelve different girls?
What the hell was that for?
You're a pig.
Why'd you hit me?
Do you know how many different men I've had sex with?
Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
Three.
Three?
Three including you.
You've only had sex with three different people?
I'm not the pig you are.
Who?
You!
No; who were the three, besides me?
John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.
Wow. That's great. That's something to be proud of.
I am. And that's why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. You'll sleep with anything that says yes.
Animal, vegetable, or mineral.
Vegetable meaning paraplegic.
They put up the least amount of struggle.
After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big.
All right. Name it.
I want you to come with me on Monday.
Where?
To school. There's a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program after a lapse in enrollment.
Can't we ever have a discussion without that coming up?
It's important to me, Dante. You have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit. I wish you'd go back to school.
Shit! Why are we getting up?
Why do you call him that?
Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing.
What do you mean?
After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. It's called snowballing.
He requested this?
He gets off on it.
Sylvan can be talked into anything.
Why do you say that?
Like you said-she snowballed him.
Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.
Yeah, right.
You sucked that guy's dick?
Yeah. How do you think I know he liked...
But... but you said you only had sex with three guys! You never mentioned him!
That's because I never had sex with him!
You sucked his dick!
We went out a few times. We didn't have sex, but we fooled around.
Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys?
Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people.
Oh my God-I feel so nauseous...
I'm sorry, Dante. I thought you understood.
I did understand! I understand that you slept with three different guys, and that's all you said.
Please calm down.
How many?
Dante...
How many dicks have you sucked?!
Let it go...
HOW MANY?
All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
Well...?
Something like thirty-six.
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
Lower your voice!
What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me?
Um. Thirty-seven.
I'M THIRTY-SEVEN?
I'm going to class.
Hey! Where are you going?!
Hey listen, jerk! Until today you never even knew how many guys I'd slept with, because you never even asked. And then you act all nonchalant about fucking twelve different girls. Well, I never had sex with twelve different guys!
No, but you sucked enough dick!
Yeah, I went down on a few guys...
A few?
...And one of those guys was you! The last one, I might add, which-if you're too stupid to comprehend- means that I've been faithful to you since we met! All the other guys I went with before I met you, so, if you want to have a complex about it, go ahead! But don't look at me like I'm the town whore, because you
Well... why did you have to suck their dicks? Why didn't you just sleep with them, like any decent person?!
Because going down it's a big deal! I used to like a guy, we'd make out, and sooner or later I'd go down on him. But I only had sex with the guys I loved.
I feel sick.
I love you. Don't feel sick.
I'm going to school. Maybe later you'll be a bit more rational.
Thirty-seven. I just can't...
He still hasn't shown up. Why aren't you in class?
Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch.
What is it?
Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. What do you think it is? It's lasagne.
Really? You're the best.
You had to tell him.
I had to tell someone. He put it into perspective.
What did he say?
At least he wasn't thirty-six.
And that made you feel better?
And he said most of them are college guys, I've never met or seen.
The ostrich syndrome: if you don't see it...
...it isn't there. Yes.
Thank you for being rational.
Thank you for the lasagne.
You couldn't get these shutters open?
I called a locksmith and he said the earliest he could get here it tomorrow.
Bummer, Well, I've gotta head back for the one-thirty class.
What time do you get finished?
Eight. But I have a sorority meeting till nine, so I'll be back before you close. Can we go out and get some coffee?
Sure.
What the fuck did you do that for?
If you didn't want to go out with me anymore, why didn't you just say it? Instead, you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back!
What're you talking about?
You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks!
It was only a few times...
And then you pull that shit this morning, freaking out because I've gone down on a couple guys!
A couple...?
I'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex, sneaking around behind your back! And if you think that thirty-seven dicks are a lot, then just wait, mister: I'm going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys I go down on now!
Would you let me explain...
Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her?
You're damn right it's not like that! Because I won't let it be like that! You want your slut? Fine! The slut is yours!
I don't want Caitlin...
You don't know what you want, but I'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out! I've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction. I even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if I was
I don't want to go back with her...
Of course not; not now! You're caught, and now you're trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do. Well, I won't let you. I want you to follow through on this, just so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are. And when she dumps you again- and she will, Dante, I promise you that-when she dumps you again,
Randal...?
And having him tell me... that was just the weakest move ever. You're spineless.
Veronica, I love you...
You hold the counter and I'll pull.
Usually I just turn the can upside down.
Maybe we should soap your hand or something.
They oughta put some kind of warning on these cans, like they do with cigarettes.
Thanks. I thought I was gonna have to go to the hospital.
I'll throw this out. Precautionary measure.
It stings a little.
You open?
Yes. I'm not out of shape.
Excuse me, but have you been here all day?
Were you working here at about four o'clock?
I'm not out of shape!
Can I have your name please?
Here you go.
What's this?
A fine, for five hundred dollars.
What are you talking about?
According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor.
I didn't do that!
You said you were here all day?
Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours. It's doubled due to
I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! I swear!
Oh shit, look who it is. The human vacuum.
Scumbag. What are you doing?
Nothing. Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin.
He's your cousin?
Check this out, he's from Russia.
No way.
He only speaks Russian?
No way!
What did he say?
That doesn't sound metal.
Did he say "making fuck?"
What part of Russia?
Is he staying here?
He really wants to play metal?
Come on, man, "Berserker!"
Does he sing in English or Russian?
Let me ask you a question: Do you think this guy's out of shape?
I don't know. I can't really tell from here.
I think the lady called it.
My ex-boyfriend was about his height, but he was much bulkier. He could bench two-fifty, three hundred easy.
I do about three-fifty, four.
No way!
Feel that.
That's tight. Solid.
It's probably from being around all this food every day.
You're Dante Hicks? Oh my God! I didn't even recognize you!
To an Asian design major.
Oh my God! You're Rick Derris?
Really?
Holy shit! She told you about that! Buddy of mine worked there. Said he watched the whole thing. They used to film people at that hotel; nobody knew about it.
To a five-year-old kid? What a scumbag!
Sure. How about the beach?
You've never heard anybody say anything about either movie?
I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
I just held up the same two movies. You're not even paying attention.
No, I wasn't.
I don't think your manager would appreciate...
I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
I beg your pardon!
Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.
I only pointed out that you weren't paying any attention to what I was saying.
I hope it feels good.
You hope what feels good?
Well this is the last time I ever rent here...
You'll be missed.
That's the price, my brother.
Yo, I don't have that kind of cash.
For this kind of hash, you need that kind of cash.
How long you gonna be here?
Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party.
You're gonna be at John K's party?
My man is deaf. I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY! Neh.
Yo, don't sell all that. 'Cause I'm gonna get the cash and buy it from you at John K's. You're gonna bring it, right?
The only place I don't bring my drugs is church. And that ain't till Sunday morning.
Yo. I'll see you at that party. I'll see you there?
And... he told you all of this?
Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory.
I... I don't know what to say.
Don't hold it against him. He just never got Caitlin out of his system. It's not your fault. It's Dante. I don't know thing one about chicks. Do you want to cry or something? I can leave.
I'm not sad.
You're not?
No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed off. I feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it! He has his friend do it for him!
He didn't ask me to...
After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut!
Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?
The guy ain't here yet.
You're kidding. It's almost eleven- thirty!
I know. I've been here since eleven.
Man! I hate it when I can't rent videos!
I would've went to Big Choice, but the tape I want is right there on the wall.
Which one?
Dental School.
You came for that too? That's the movie I came for.
I have first dibs.
Says who?
Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs.
Ain't gonna happen, my friend. I'm getting that tape.
Like hell you are!
I'll bet you twenty bucks you don't get to rent that tape.
Twenty bucks?
Twenty bucks.
Willam!
Ronnie! How are you? You work here now?
No, I transferred into Monmouth this year. I was tired of missing him.
Do you still talk to Sylvan?
I just talked to her on Monday. We still hang out on weekends.
That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds take it easy, all right?
I will. Take it easy.
Bye.
Gabe! Hey, man! Gabe! It's Gabe!
Work! Don't say that word, man.
Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it!
Hey, Gabe, we're flyin' off the Tower today. C'mon with us.
Did you catch that thunder?
"It's a perfect day for a monster jump." Hey man, can you like do me a favor?
What?
Next time you're like watching MTV, y' know, like flip it to the weather channel for a split second and check it out. I mean, hey, we could be home watching some righteous pornos.
That woulda been cool.
Answer the man.
C-4?
Ready to die quiet-like, asshole.
Hey, let's get something straight. If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, but you're always gonna be the asshole, so just shoot, alright.
Did I hear somethin' break? Outside left!
Fuck you.
Hal's signalling he's OK.
He said the Tower, but he's on Comb Bluff? Frank, fly me to the west valley, the winds are never too bad there and it's only a half hour climb to the Douglas Shaft.
I don't know.
If I don't meet up with them, you can come and pick me up by nightfall.
And it's such a handsome head. Please Frank, and I swear I'll buy one of your paintings.
Jessie, Jessie, copy?
I copy.
Jessie, girl this is insane. Weather stat called in wind gusts up to 50 knots for tonight.
If you can't make it back, I'll hold up at the Douglas Shaft. Stop worryin'. You sound like a mother hen.
Jessie, Hal, come in...please report. Over.
Hey, Jessie, you're just in time for another masterpiece.
So, what do you see?
Surprise me.
What usually eats a banana?
A monkey?
So...what are you, blind, son? This is a banana eating a monkey, nature in reverse.
That was the first and last question-- now only answers. Where's the chopper?
It can't fly in this weather.
You know how the airlines are.
Bags?
Looks like the Tower. It's a bad climb.
Go on, fetch.
Tucker?
Jessie! Are you alright?
I want the money--meet me at the highest point from where you are. Don't do it and we're going to see if your angel here can fly. Copy?
Copy. Jessie, go to the top of Bitker ladder.
Where are you, Walker?
Throw it up or I'll kill her.
You do, and the spring thaw is going to be worth a lot of cash!
The money!
Glad you could drop in.
Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee?
I think it's out. No big deal. It's that old football injury.
Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
I love you, too.
Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare <u>idiot line</u> for transport, over.
Remember, keep your arms and legs within the vehicle at all times--
I'm coming out!
No, stay off the line! You'll break her loose!
She's losing it!
What the hell are you doing here?!
I was with Jessie, she filled me in.
Now let me fill you in. You can get your ass back down an' go back to that hole you been hiding in--
When we get this group down, I'm gone.
You're gone now! I don't climb with people I can't trust. Why'd you come up, to prove something?
I'm here for the same reason you are, so let's do it.
Can't pass up another chance to play hero, can you.
Look, I know--
You don't know anything. You did it your way and she died.
I did what I thought was right.
Well you were wrong! It was your weight on the line that did it--
There wasn't time for anything else.
We'll never know, will we?
Look, it was a bad time for everybody.
What the hell do you know about bad time. You didn't love her, you didn't have to explain to her family.
No, buddy, it was you who dropped it!
Forget me. If you can, get away.
Thanks for staying around when you didn't have to.
How's your leg? I'll live. Where'd you leave Jessie?
Near Freedom Falls. She went for help.
What are we going to do?
I'm going with you.
Not on that leg.
Take the gun.
Room service...Hi, Sarah.
How're ya feeling?
Fine, I guess...
She's tough.
Sarah, tonight why don't you and Hal come over for dinner?
Please, can I think about this for a minute...Okay, I'm sorry, it's fine. What do you want me to do?
Just keep lookin' at me and only think about the distance <u>across</u>. Count it as you go: One, two...by eight you'll be there.
Can I count as fast as I like?
Sure you can.
There you go.
Two...
That's it, you look like a professional.
Four...five...
Nice and easy...
Please -- oh, no -- please!
Use your other hand! Grab it!
Help me! I don't want to die!
Do you see them yet?
Patience my love, patience.
That's a virtue isn't it?
Gabe? Gabe, where are you?
Oh, my God! I can't recognize the face, but the butt does look vaguely familiar.
He knows it well.
The ledge, I know it well, or should I say <u>we</u> know it well.
You can stop right there.
We spent a night there one night...
Enough.
Yeah, we were caught in a storm. I went up there an innocent climber...
And when I came down, my morals were corrupted forever.
The winds are picking up.
Hello, Gabriel.
When you call me Gabriel, I know I've got trouble.
Where've you been?
Working...I'm trying to figure out where to start.
Maybe I can help. Let's see... if one night I got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note, and stayed away for months, I think what I'd want to do is come up with a well thought-out reason.
After the funeral I just had to leave.
Had to leave? Believe me, we all wanted to leave...but you know what? We stayed.
A lot of things fell apart up there.
I know...
I don't think you do.
Why can't you believe that you did everything you could?
Did I? I don't know. Maybe I shouldn't have gone out on that line. Maybe I panicked.
I was there, you were the only one who didn't panic. So do everyone a favor, don't hog all the guilt. You held on as long as you could. Yes, everything did go wrong, starting with Hal. I mean, what was he doing up on the Tower with a girl who could barely climb?
I can't blame anything on Hal. It was me. I play it back in my mind everyday.
Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better.
I don't expect you to understand.
I don't understand?
You couldn't.
You're saying, I don't understand? I'm the <u>only</u> one who does understand. I'm the one you lived with for two years, I'm the one you made promises to, I'm the one who spent too many nights looking up at these rocks and wondering if you were ever going to make it down in once piece or ever at all. Believe me, there's been times
Why are you yelling?
Excuse me?
Why are you yelling?
Did I miss something?
Y'know, yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting--
I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay?
Okay, but if you do I'll have to perform resuscitation--
Resuscitation?
--mouth-to-mouth, which could maybe...
Which could maybe what?
Maybe lead to a flare up...
A flare up...
Flare up of old emotions...
Listen to you... The old "mouth-to-mouth" resuscitation routine, huh?
From one professional to another, of course.
Course maybe you don't have to wait until I faint.
Gabe, did you come back to stay? You didn't.
I can't. Not here. If you want, I'd like you to come with me...somewhere else.
Where?
It doesn't matter, anywhere but here.
You come back after being gone almost a year, and you expect me to just leave... This was <u>our</u> home, now it's <u>my</u> home. I can't leave. You can stay with me, and believe me, I want you to, but to just take off for the wrong reasons, I can't do it. And you shouldn't either.
Like I said, I can't turn it off.
And I can't leave.
If it's alright, I'm gonna pick up the rest of my gear.
You know where everything is... I'm late for my shift.
Thank God you didn't leave. We just got a Mayday. Seven climbers stranded off Comb Bluff. The weather's pouring in fast and Hal's gone up alone.
If he gets up there and the weather gets as bad as it can, they'll never make it down. He needs someone who has emergency medical training and knows every handhold on these peaks.
He doesn't want my help.
That's not the issue here, those people are. He can't do it alone.
He can handle it.
What if he can't?
I haven't climbed in months--you lose the feel.
I know you don't want to be responsible for anybody's life anymore, but walk away and you are responsible. Please Gabe, he went up the west ridge. If you go up the south face, you can catch him, no problem--
Can't do it? I don't believe this. Don't you feel anything?
Gabe!?
What are you doing here!?
Looking for Hal. Oh my God, I heard someone kick the door open...you came back.
How'd you get up here?
Frank dropped me in the west valley and I hiked. You look frozen. What's happening?!
You got to go back now!
Before it crashed, they dumped three cases filled with millions. They're using Hal for a bird dog. Once they find the money, Hal's dead. So get on your radio, contact Frank, have him pick you up, then contact the state police, the park police and anything else wearing a badge and tell them to get up here! Do it Jessie.
I can't. The radio's at the bottom of the shaft. But Frank'll be looking for me soon. When he gets here I'll contact everybody from the chopper.
That's no good. It'll be dark soon, there's no other shelter for ten miles. If they show, they'll take you too. Why'd you have to come up here?!
For the same reason you did, to help.
Let's be creative.
They've got to find shelter soon, and so do we. How are you holding up?
Take off and meet me at Eagle Cave.
What about you?
Man, it costs a fortune to heat this place.
I'm glad you find humor in this. Do you know what people would do for that?
I can't believe you just said that.
Neither can I. What do you think they're doing now?
You still wear the cable necklace I gave you.
Call me sentimental.
Remember the first time we came up here?
Of course I do.
It was great.
You attacked me.
Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?
Only kidding...<u>actually</u> I attacked you.
Why can't things stay the way they are...everything has to change. What we had was perfect.
Gabe...your arm?
Yeah?
If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?
We have to get through to the other side. You up for it?
I've gone this far, and right now I think I'm in better shape than you.
A simple yes or no would have done.
Want me to lead?
Nice view, huh?
What was God thinking when he built this place?
Gabe! Are you alright?
Can you see light?
Gabe are you alright?
No luck?
She's a lyin' bitch!!
They'll kill him! He has no idea!
We might be able to go that way.
Pull it apart!
What?
Start pulling it apart! We're climbing down on it.
This rope is sixty years old!
These old ropes can hold 900 lbs., each strand 300. I'm 190, you're about 135 -- it just may hold.
Never
Never, what?!
I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
Frank! No, Frank! Frank!
Gabe!
Reach up! Do it!
Don't let me fall!
Thanks for holding on.
We were going together before I ever let go of you.
I'm holding you to that. Gabe, what about Frank?
Crockett River is where the last of the money fell.
If we go along the northern ridge, we can get there first.
There's no "we". There's a me. All I have to do is make it along the north wall to Bitker Ladder. What you're doing is going back down to the station to get help. And don't put on that mad face.
Forget it. You're in no shape to climb alone. I stayed with you this far, and you didn't drop me, so I owe you. C'mon, let's go. Hurry up, time is money.
My heart can't take much more of this. Look, if we climb down from here, it'll take two hours to get back to the station.
That's exactly what I want you to do.
What do you think? Maybe I could reach the ledge without falling. No, forget it.
But maybe with a good start I can hit those hand-holds.
Hand-holds?! I can barely see them.
We don't have time to argue about it!
Are you crazy? Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe?
Take the rope.
I won't do it. No way.
Take the rope.
Enough's enough. How could anybody in their right mind... then again, you never were in your right mind.
Wrap it around that rock twice.
I'm going to wrap it around your throat!
An' if I miss, dig in and try your best to slow the fall.
Forget it! I refuse!
Fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience.
Just kidding.
Gabe? Wait 'til I get over there. Tie the rope so I can come across.
What about you?!
The "old mouth to mouth" resuscitation routine.
There's a lot more where that came from. You're not leaving again?
Look here, the mountain man. You're Walker, right?
Good memory. You must be great with numbers.
Your mouth's writing a check your ass can't cash, but if ya wanna buy some life, bring me the money.
I burned it.
What the fuck you mean you burned it?
Never could save a thing.
Where's the helicopter?
The faster you find the bags, the bigger you boys' finder's fee will be.
He'll freeze.
What's he doing?
Talk. No tricks, no codes, no messages. You haven't found us. It was a fake call.
Mr. Travers is not the athletic type, he needs something more direct.
Souvenirs? No, wrong answer. Looks like your friend plans on hanging around, that possible?
No, he's gone.
It's up there, on the Tower.
For Christ's sake, they're kids.
You son of a bitch! You said you wouldn't kill him!
Murdering, motherfucker...
You said there was a way across.
He never hurt anybody.
Travers, you're not running things.
Tucker, you know where the money is-- I want it.
Qualen, go fuck yourself. The game's over--you lost.
No, the goddamn game's not over! It's never over when you're playing against a team that doesn't care if they win or lose-- how do you negotiate with someone like that?!
Yeah...
What's your names?
Tucker and Walker.
Have her come up.
On top of the peak.
He asked you, how far?! I think you've been taking the scenic route. How far from here?
Then where the fuck is!
Rescue One -- please be advised Ranger Walker is making advances toward my girlfriend that are liable to get his ass kicked right into space, over.
Go after her.
Got to be Comb Bluff.
You and Frank get the tents, thermal clothing, and medical supplies together.
Who's going with you?
You're looking at him.
Where's the rest of the team?
You gotta be kidding me! Do you want me to fly up after you? Over.
Oh, my God!
Right.
I don't know about totally.
Who the hell ever is. This is the most protected shipment we've got-- and the most useless. These bills aren't even <u>in</u> circulation; the one thousand dollar bills we're transporting are only used for international banking exchange.
What the hell are you doing--
Now I have jurisdiction! I said get your weapons.
Calm down...give the gun to me. You're out of control, son.
Travers! Hurry it up.
Why didn't you send the money over?
What's the delay?
Kill me? Christ we're partners in this!
Were. Give me the tracking monitor!
Why? What are you going to do?!
Don't use my name!
Ask the questions.
Where's the third one, Travers?
Get off my back, Qualen!
Don't give him anything.
I don't trust him.
Bring down the money or your friend's dead!
Man against nature, right Travers.
What about it?
This way.
He's alive!
Jessie? Looks like your friend found company.
Good, Travers. It might catch on, like shooting skeet.
This is insane. The hell with the money. You radio in for that chopper, understand!
Is it set?
Why the hell are we wasting time here?!
What's the code, Travers?
I told you, 50,000 possible keycode combinations, in fifteen second intervals.
You got what we need?
No, that son-of-a-bitch Walker is alive.
No names, this is an open line!
I don't give a shit, Qualen! I had to be insane to ever tie up with a low-life, piece of shit like you. They beat us. A couple of fuckin' hick mountain boys beat the man no law agency ever could.
Rich...
Good morning, Walt.
I'd like to have a word with you. This is Agent Matheson, FBI.
Richard Travers.
Matheson has been transferred from the Denver office to Frisco. As a professional courtesy between offices, I was asked if he could hitch a ride.
We've got a full crew, but we can squeeze one more, right.
Appreciate it.
Mostly. Armored cars can be hijacked. Trains can be derailed. But nobody can get to us in flight.
I haven't lost a bill in eighteen years, don't jinx me, Walt.
I think Treasury personnel are the most superstitious people in the federal government.
Hello Lucy, had a busy night? Puts money in machine.
We've been working hard too. Takes glass.
Pardon me. Luce. He raises glass to breast, pulls red handle between her legs. Milk spurts into glass. Dim joins the others. Alex looks at a party of tourists.
There was some sophistos from the TV studios around the corner, laughing an govoreeting. The Devotchka was smecking away, and not caring about the wicked world one bit. Then the disc on the stereo twanged off and out, and in the short silence before the next one came on, she suddenly came with a burst of singing, and it was like for a moment,
What did you do that for?
For being a bastard with no manners and not a dook of an idea how to comport yourself publicwise, O my Brother.
I don't like you should do what you done. And I'm not your brother no more and wouldn't want to be.
Watch that... Do watch that, O Dim, if to continue to be on live thou dost wish.
Yarbles, great bolshy yarblockos to you I'll meet you with chain, or nozh or britva, any time, not having you aiming tolchocks at me reasonless. It stands to reason, I won't have it.
A nozh scrap any time you say. Dim weakens.
He are here! He have arrived! Hooray!
Sorry about the pain. Using the gulliver to much like, eh? Giving orders and disciplining and that perhaps, eh? You sure the pain's gone? You sure you'll not be happier back up in bed.
One minoota, droogie. Dim smashes Alex in the face with a full milk bottle. He goes down. The others run away, laughing.
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, if it isn't little Alex. Long time no viddy, droog. How goes? Surprised are you?
Come on, Alex. Come for walkies. Hahahahaha.
Come, come, my little droogies. I just don't get this at all. The old days are dead and gone. For what I did in the past I've been punished.
Been punished, yeah?
I've been cured.
Been cured, yeah, that was read out to us. The Inspector read all that out to us. He said it was a very good way.
I just don't get this all. It was them that went for me, brothers. You're not on their side and can't be. You can't be Dim. It was someone we fillied with back in the old days... Trying to get his own malenky bit of revenge after all this time. You remember, Dim?
Dear, dear, dear. Whatever happened to you, my boy? Mr. Alexander, now confined to a wheelchair, pushes himself away from his desk, and rolls up to Julian. The water drips off Alex's clothes. They look at each other.
The police... The horrible ghastly Police. They beat me up, sir. The Police beat me up, sir. Mr. Alexander stares at him. It becomes apparent he is insane.
I know who you are! Isn't it your picture in the newspapers? Didn't I see you this morning on the video? Are you not the poor victim of this horrible new technique?
Yes, sir, that's exactly who I am, sir... and what I am... a victim, sir. Mr. Alexander becomes frenzied as the speech progresses.
Good evening, sir.
Good evening.
It was very kind of you to leave this out for me, sir. There was no-one around when I finished my bath, so I started. I hope that's alright, sir.
Of course. Food alright?
Great, sir. Great.
Try the wine!
Thank you very much, sir. Cheers Suddenly the thought occurs to Alex that the wine may be drugged or poisoned.
Won't you join me, sir?
No, my health doesn't allow it.
I'm so pleased you appreciate good wine. Have another glass!
Thank you, sir.
My wife... Alex freezes.
... used to do everything for me and leave me to my writing.
Your wife, sir? Has she gone away?
No. She's dead!
I'm sorry to hear about that, sir. His face contorted in rage.
She was very badly raped, you see. We were assaulted by a gang of vicious young hooligans in this house, in this very room you're sitting in now. I was left a helpless cripple. The doctors said it was Pneumonia, because it happened some months later during the 'flu epidemic. The doctors told me it was Pneumonia, but I knew what it was. A
And now you, another victim of the modern age. But you can be helped. I phoned some friends while you were having a bath.
Phoned some friends, sir?
Yes. They want to help.
Help me, sir?
Help you.
Who are they, sir?
They're very, very important people and they're interested in you. Bell rings. Julian rises,
Julian. This will be these people now. Alex gets up.
Look, sir. I'm sorry to have troubled you. I think I ought to be going, sir. Julian bars the way.
Excuse me, missus, can you please help? There's been a terrible accident. Can I please use your telephone for an ambulance?
I'm frightfully sorry. There is a telephone in the Public House about a mile down the road. I suggest you use that.
But, missus, this is an emergency. It's a matter of life and death. Me friend's lying in the middle of the road bleeding to death.
I... I'm very sorry, but I never open. I'm very sorry but I never open the door to strangers after dark.
Hi, hi, hi there, at last we meet.
What the bloody hell d'you think you're doing?
Our brief govereet thru the letter hole was not, shall we say, satisfactory, yes?
Now listen here, you little bastard, just you turn around and walk out of here the same way as you came in. Alex eyes a giant white, fibreglass phallic sculpture on the table beside him.
Naughty, naughty, naughty, you filthy old soomaka.
No! No! Don't touch it. That's a very important work of art. What the bloody hell do you want?
You see, madam, I am part of an international student's contest to see who can get the most points for selling magazines.
So this is the young man?
How do you do, sir?
Hullo.
Very kind of you, sir. Thank you very much.
I understand that you had a rather unfortunate encounter with the Police tonight.
Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir.
Hahaha, and how are you feeling now?
Much better, thank you, sir.
Feel like talking to us. Answering a few questions?
Fine, sir, fine.
Well, as I've said, we've heard about you. We are interested in your case. We want to help you.
Thank you very much, sir.
But first we'd like to find out a few things about you.
What would you like to know, sir?
Well, shall we get down to it?
It's past eight, Alex, you don't want to be late for school, son.
Bit of pain in the gulliver, Mum. Leave us be and I'll try to sleep it off... then I'll be as right as dodgers for this after.
You've not been to school all week, son.
I've got to rest, Mum... got to get fit, otherwise I'm liable to miss a lot more school.
Eeee... I'll put your breakfast in the oven. I've got to be off myself now.
Hi. Hi. Hi, there my Pee and Em. All three look up startled.
Alex.
Why didn't you let us know what was happening, son?
Ah, Alex boy, awake at last, yes? I met your mother on the way to work, yes? She gave me the key. She said something about a pain somewhere... hence not at school , yes?
A rather intolerable pain in the head, brother, sir. I think it should be clear by this afterlunch.
Oh, or certainly by this evening, yes? The evening's a great time, isn't it, Alex boy?
A cup of the old chai, sir?
No time, no time, yes. Sit, sit, sit. Alex sits next to him.
To what do I owe this extreme pleasure, sir? Anything wrong, sir? Deltoid "playfully" grabs Alex's hair.
Wrong? Why should you think of anything being wrong, have you been doing something you shouldn't. Yes? He shakes Alex's hair.
Just a manner of speech, sir.
Well, yes, it's just a manner of speech from your Post Corrective Advisor to you that you watch out, little Alex. He puts his arm round Alex's shoulder.
Because next time it's going to be the barry place and all my work ruined. If you've no respect for your horrible self, you at least might have some for me who'se sweated over you. He slaps Alex on the knee.
A big black mark I tell you for every one we don't reclaim. A confession of failure for every one of you who ends up in the stripy hole.
I've been doing nothing I shouldn't, sir. The millicents have nothing on me, brother, sir, I mean. Deltoid pulls Alex down on the bed.
Cut out all this clever talk about milicents. Just because the Police haven't picked you up lately doesn't, as you very well know, mean that you've not been up to some nastiness. There was a bit of a nastiness last night, yes. Some very extreme nastiness, yes. A few of a certain Billyboy's friends were ambluenced off late last night, yes. Your name was
What gets into you all? We study the problem. We've been studying it for damn well near a century, yes, but we get no further with our studies. You've got a good home here, good loving parents, you've got not too bad of a brain. Is it some devil that crawls inside of you?
Nobody's got anything on me, brother, sir. I've been out of the rookers of the milicents for a long time now.
That's just worries me. A bit too long to long to be reasonable. You're about due now by my reckoning, that's why I'm warning you, little Alex, to keep your handsome young proboscis out of the dirt. Do I make myself clear?
You are now a murderer, little Alex. A murderer, yes.
Not true, sir. It was only a slight tolchock. She was breathing, I swear it.
I've just come back from the hospital. Your victim has died.
You try to frighten me, sir, admit so, sir. This is some new form of torture. Say it, brother, sir.
The newspapers mentioned that in addition to your being conditioned against acts of sex and violence, you've inadvertently been conditioned against music.
Well, er, I think that was something that they hadn't planned for, you see, Missus, I'm very fond of music and always have been, especially Beethoven, Ludwig van... Beethoven. B... E... E... He leans over and looks at her writing in notebook.
It's alright, thank you.
And it just so happened that while they were showing me a particularly bad film, of like a concentration camp, the background music was playing Beethoven.
So now you have the same reaction to music as you do to sex and violence?
Oh well, it's... it's not all music you see, Missus. It's just the 9th.
You mean Beethoven's 9th Symphony?
That's right. Er... I can't listen to the 9th any more at all. When I hear the 9th, I get like this funny feeling.
When you say this funny feeling, you mean the state of mind brought on by the treatment they gave you?
That is correct, sir. And then all I can think about is like trying to snuff it.
I beg your pardon?
Snuff it, sir... um... death, I mean, missus... Er... I just want to die peacefully like with no... pain.
Do you feel that way now?
Um... oh no, sir, not exactly, I still feel very miserable, very much down in spirits.
Do you still feel suicidal?
Um... well, put it this way... I feel very low in myself. I can't see much in the future, and I feel that any second something terrible is going to happen to me. He pitches forward, face into the plate of spaghetti.
We got worried. There we were waiting and drinking away at the old knify Moloko and you had not turned up and we thought you might have been like offended by something or other, so around we come to your abode.
All right, no more picking on Dim, brother. That's part of the new way.
New way? What's this about a new way? There's been some very large talk behind my sleeping back, and no error. Let me hear more.
And what will you do with the big, big, money? Have you not everything you need? If you need a motor-car, you pluck it from the trees. If you need pretty polly, you take it.
Brother, you think and talk sometimes like a little child. Tonight we pull a mansize crast.
Good. Real horrorshow. Initiative comes to them as waits. I've taught you much, my little droogies. Now tell me what you have in mind, Georgie Boy.
Not tonight - not this nochy.
Come, come, come, Georgie Boy. You're a big strong chelloveck like us all. We're not little children, are we, Georgie Boy? What, then, didst thou in thy mind have? Confrontation. Georgie backs down.
It's this Health Farm. A bit out of the town. Isolated. It's owned by this like very rich ptitsa who lives there with her cats. The place is shut down for a week and she's completely on her own, and it's full up with like gold and silver and like jewels.
Who said that?
I did, sir.
What crime did you commit.
Thank you very much for this chance, sir.
She came towards me with the light like it was the like light of heavenly grace, and the first thing that flashed into my gulliver was that I would like to have her right down there on the floor with the old in-out, real savage. But quick as a shot came the sickness, like a detective that had been watching around the corner and
Thank you very much. Thank you my dear. Girl bows and exits to loud applause.
Not feeling too bad now are you?
No, sir, I feel really great.
Good.
Was I alright, sir? Did I do well, sir?
Good evening, my boy.
Yes, sir, and a very lovely place it is too, sir, when I wake up in the middle of the night with my pain.
Yes... well good to see you on the mend. I've kept in constant touch with the hospital, of course, and now I've come to see you personally to see how you're getting along.
I've suffered the tortures of the damned. The tortures of the damned, sir.
Yes I can... Oh look, let me do that for you, shall I?
Thank you, sir.
I can tell you that I... and the Government of which I am a member are deeply sorry about this, my boy. Deeply sorry. We tried to help you. We followed recommendations had been made to us that turned out to be wrong. An enquiry will place the responsibility where it belongs. We want you to regard us as friends. We've put you right,
Where is he now, sir?
We put him away where he can do you no harm. You see we are looking after your interests. We are interested in you, and when you leave here you will have no further worries. We shall see to everything... a good job on a good salary.
What job and how much?
You must have an interesting job at a salary which you would regard as adequate. Not only for the job which you are going to do and in compensation for what you believe you have suffered, but also because you are helping us.
Helping you, sir?
We always help our friends, don't we? It is no secret that the Government has lost a lot of popularity because of you, my boy. There are some that think that at the next election we shall be out. The press has chosen to take a very unfavourable view of what we tried to do.
Well, who can blame them, sir?
Mmmm, possibly. Yes. But public opinion has a way of changing and you, Alex, if I may call you, Alex?
Certainly, sir. What do they call you at home?
My name is Frederick. As I was saying, Alex, you can be instrumental in changing the public verdict. Do you understand, Alex? Have I made myself clear?
As an unmuddied lake, Fred. As clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. You can rely on me, Fred.
Good... good boy. Oh yes, I understand you're fond of music. I have arranged a little surprise for you.
Surprise?
One I think you will like... as a, how shall I put it, as a symbol of our new understanding. An understanding between two friends.
Hullo lad. What a surprise, good to see you.
Keeping fit then?
Fine, fine.
Well, how are you then?
Oh fine, fi. Keeping out of trouble, you know.
Well - I'm back.
That's right, Dad they did a great job on my gulliver, I'm completely reformed.
Aye.
Well, still the same old place then, eh?
Oh, aye, aye.
Hey, Dad, there's a strange fella sitting on the sofa there munchy- wunching lomticks of toast.
Aye, that's Joe. He... ummmm, lives here now. The lodger. That's what he is... he... he rents your room. Alex confronts Joe.
No thanks, Mum. It'll pass in a minute... ... What have you done with all my own personal things?
Well. That was all took away, son, by the Police. New regulation about compensation for the victim.
What about Basil? Where's my snake?
Oh well, he met with like an accident. He passed away. Alex becomes a bit weepy.
What's gonna happen to me then? I mean that's my room he's in - there's no denying that. This is my home also. What suggestions have you, my Pee and Em, to make?
What gives, O my Pee and Em, what makes you think you are welcome? Em sobs. Pee comforts her.
Hello, heap of dirt. Pooh, you don't wash much do you, judging by the horrible smell.
Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning.
Oh, he had a shower this morning. You trying to call me a liar?
No, brother. What d'you want?
What do I want?
Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
Oh. Oh, you're sorry are you, well you must think I'm awfully stupid. He slaps Alex in the face.
Why did you do that, brother? I've never done wrong to you.
You want to know why I did that, well you see - I do that... He stamps on Alex's foot.
... and this... He pulls Alex's nose.
... and that... He pulls Alex's ear, pushes him off balance and plants his foot on his chest.
... because I don't like you horrible type, do I, and if you want to start something... if you want to start... go on... well, you just start. Please do. Alex retching.
I'm gonna be sick.
You're gonna be sick are you?
I wanna be sick.
You wanna be sick?
Let me get up.
You wanna get up? Well, you've gotta you see... well I want you to lick it. Go on... Lick it. Alex, gagging and coughing, licks the sole of his shoe.
... And again... Go on!!! Again! There's a good boy.
You are now in H.M. Prison Parkmoor and from this moment you will address all prison officers as sir! Name?
Alexander de Large, sir.
Crime?
Murder, sir.
Yes, sir.
Then your toes belong on the other side of it!!!
Yes sir.
Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.
Pick that up and put it down properly. Alex does so, and continues to empty his pockets.
One half bar of chocolate. One bunch of keys on white metal ring. One packet of cigarettes. Two plastic ball pens - one black, one red. One pocket comb - black plastic. One address book - imitation red leather. One ten penny piece. One white metal wristlet watch, "Timawrist" on a white metal expanding bracelet. Anything else in your pockets?
No, sir.
Right. Sign here for your valuable property. Alex signs.
The chocolate and cigarettes you brought in - you lose that as you are now convicted. Now go over to the table and get undressed. Alex walks to table and undresses. Chief Guard moves to table with his clipboard.
Now then, were you in Police custody this morning?
Religion?
C of E, sir.
Do you mean Church of England?
Yes, sir, Church of England, sir.
Brown hair, is it?
Fair hair, sir.
Blue eyes?
Blue eyes, yes, sir.
Do you wear eye glasses or contact lenses?
Have you ever had any mental illness?
No, sir.
Do you wear any false teeth or false limbs?
Are you an Epileptic?
No, sir.
No, sir.
Crabs?
No, sir.
Lice?
No, sir.
Through there for a bath.
You're absolutely right, sir.
The next morning I was taken to the Ludovico Medical Facility, outside the town centre, and I felt a malenky bit sad having to say goodbye to the old Staja, as you always will when you leave a place you've like gotten used to. Chief Guard briskly leads the way for Alex and escort. They move into reception hall where the Doctor stands.
Good morning, Alex, my name is Dr. Branom. I'm Doctor Brodsky's assistant.
Good Morning, Missus. Lovely day, isn't it?
Indeed it is. May I take this She removes his tray.
How're you feeling this morning?
Fine... fine.
Good. In a few minutes, you'll meeting Dr. Brodsky and we'll begin your treatment. You're a very lucky boy to have been chosen.
I realise all that, Missus, and I'm very grateful to all concerned.
We're going to friends now, sir.
I hope so, Missus. She inserts a needle into the medicine vial.
What's the hypo for then? Going to send me to sleep?
Oh no, nothing of the sort.
Vitamins will it be then?
Something like that. You are a little undernourished, so after each meal were going to give you a shot. Roll over on your right side please, loosen your pyjama pants and pull them half-way down. He does, somewhat reluctantly. She gives him a shot in the bum.
What exactly is the treatment here going to be then?
It's quite simple really. Were just going to show you some films.
You mean like going to the pictures?
Something like that.
Well, that was a very promising start. By my calculations, you should be starting to feel alright again. Yes? Dr. Brodsky's pleased with you. Now tomorrow there'll be two sessions, of course, morning and afternoon.
You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one day?
I imagine you'll be feeling a little bit limp by the end of the day. But we have to be hard on you. You have to be cured.
But it was horrible.
Well, of course, it was horrible. Violence is a very horrible thing. That's what you're learning now. Your body is learning it.
I just don't understand about feeling sick the way I did. I never used to feel sick before. I used to feel like the very opposite. I mean, doing it or watching it, I used to feel real horrorshow. I just don't understand why, how what.
Are you referring to the background score?
Yes!!!
You've heard Beethoven before?
How are you feeling today?
Fine. Fine.
Good. I'm doctor Taylor.
I haven't seen you before.
I'm your Psychiatrist.
Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?
Just part of hospital routine.
What are we going to do? Talk about me sex life?
No... I'm going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me what you think about them Alright?
Ohhh... jolly good. Perhaps you can explain me something to me first.
Yes?
Well, when I was all like ashamed up and half awake and unconscious like, I kept having this dream like all these doctors were playing around with me gulliver. You know... like the inside of me brain. I seemed to have this dream over and over again. D'you think it means anything?
Patients who've sustained the kind of injuries you have often have dreams of this sort. It's all part of the recovery process.
Oh.
Now then, each of these slides needs a reply from one of the people in the picture. You'll tell me what you think the person would say. Alright?
Righty, right. The doctor reads aloud the dialogue printed in the cartoon balloon - a peacock.
Isn't the plumage beautiful?
I just say what the other person would say?
Yes. Yes, well don't think about it too long, just say the first thing that pops into your mind.
Right... Knickers... Cabbages... It doesn't have a beak. Alex laughs. Slide of woman speaking to boy.
Good. The boy you always quarrelled with is seriously ill.
That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop.
Good. It wa your fault... you sold me a crummy watch. I want my money back.
Bollocks. You know what you can do with that watch? You can stick it up your arse. Slide of nude woman in bed, a man at the window.
Good. What do you want?
Excuse me, missus. No time for the old in-out, I've just come to read the meter. Slide of bird's nest with eggs.
Good. You can do whatever you like with these.
Eggiwegs. I would like to smash 'em. Pick up th elot and f... owww... He slams his hand down and cries out with pain.
Fucking hell...
Fine. Well, that's all there is to it. Are you alright?
I hope so. Is that the end then?
Yes.
I was quite enjoying that.
Good. I'm glad
How many did I get right?
It's not that kind of a test. But you seem well on the way to a complete recovery.
And when do I get out of here then?
Very soon now the drug will cause the subject to experience a death- like paralysis together with deep feelings of terror and helplessness. One of our earlier test subjects described it as being like death, a sense of stifling and drowning, and it is during this period we have found the subject will make his most rewarding associations between his catastrophic experience and environment
What's all this about sin?
You're keen on music?
You needn't take it any further, sir. You've proved to me that all this ultra-violence and killing is wrong and terribly wrong. I've learned my lesson, sir. I see now what I've never seen before I'm cured, praise Bog!
You're not cured yet, my boy.
You must take your chance boy. The choice has been all yours.
But, Sir... Missus... I see that it's wrong! It's wrong because it's like against like society. It's wrong because everybody has the right to live and be happy without being tolchocked and knifed.
One thing I could never stand is to see a filthy, dirty old drunkie, howling away at the filthy songs of his fathers and going blerp, blerp in between as it might be a filthy old orchestra in his stinking rotten guts. I could never stand to see anyone like that, whatever his age might be, but more especially when he was real old
Can you... can you spare some cutter, me brothers? Alex rams his stick into the Tramp's stomach. The boys laugh.
Oh-hhh!!! Go on, do me in you bastard cowards. I don't want to live anyway, not in a stinking world like this.
Oh - and what's so stinking about it?
Can you spare me some cutter, me brother? Can you spare some cutter, me brother? Alex, without looking at him, reaches in his pocket and gives him some money.
Oh, thankyou, your honour. The Tramp takes a second look at Alex.
Jamey Mack! Be the hokey fly! Holy Mother of God! All the Holy Angels and blessed saints in Heaven preserve us. Alex breaks away but the Tramp toddles alongside him.
I never forget a face! I never forget any face, be God!
Leave me alone, brother. I've never seen you before. Tramp shouts to other Meths drinkers and Tramps.
This is the poisonous young swine that near done me in. Him and his friends beat me and kicked me and thumped me. Alex breaks away again.
Stop him! Stop him! A leg is stuck out and Alex goes down. The tramp swarm all over him.
They laughed at me blood and me moans. This murderous young pig is a prize specimen of the cowardly brutal young. He is in our midst and at our mercy. Give it to him. That's it. Old Tramps begin to beat at Alex.
If thou lose hope being weary in the days of distress, thy strength shall be diminished.
Fine, my boy, fine, fine.
Father, I have tried, have I not?
You have, my son.
I've done my best, have I not?
Indeed.
And, Father, I've never been guilty of any institutional infractions, have I?
You certainly have not, 655321. You've been very helpful, and you've shown a genuine desire to reform.
Father - may I ask you a question in private?
Certainly, my son, certainly. Is there something troubling you, my son? Don't be shy to speak up. Remember, I know all the urges that can trouble young men deprived of the society of women.
No Father. It's nothing like that, Father. It's about this new thing they're all talking about. About this new treatment that you out of prison in no time at all and makes sure you never get back in again.
Where did you hear about this? Whose been talking about these things?
These things get around, Father. Two Warders talk as it might be, and somebody can't help overhearing what they say. Then somebody picks up a scrap of newspaper in the workshops and the newspaper tells all about it. How about putting me in for this new treatment, Father?
I take it you are referring to the Ludovico Technique?
I don't know what it's called, Father, all I know is that it gets you out quickly and makes sure that you never get in again.
That's not proven, 655321. In fact, it is only in the experimental stage at this moment.
But it is being used, isn't it, Father?
It has not been used yet in this prison. The Governor has grave doubts about it and I have heard that there are very serious dangers involved.
I don't care about the danger, Father. I just want to be good. I want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness.
The question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good. Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot chose, he ceases to be a man.
I don't understand about the whys and wherefores, Father. I only know I want to be good.
Be patient, my son, and put your trust in the Lord.
Instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee and shall give delight to thy soul.
One jacket - blue pinstripe.
One shirt - blue, collar attached.
One pair of trousers - blue pinstriped.
One pair of underpants - white with blue waistband.
Mothballs, sir.
Very good, Chief. They inspect cells.
Leave to carry on, sir, please?
Carry on, Chief.
Sir, 655321, sir.
Very good, Chief. Chief Guard turns to Alex.
Shut your filthy hole, you scum!!!
You are to be reformed. Tomorrow you go to this man, Brodsky. You wbe leaving here. You will be transferred to the Ludovico Medical Facility. It is believed that you will be able to leave State custody in a little over a fortnight. I suppose that prospect pleases you?
Don't read it - sign it!
Pitiful rookerful...
And there's Will the English in the Muscleman coffee mesto saying he can fence anything that anything that any malchick tries to crast.
Yeah... Pete the English.
The shiny stuff. The Ice. The big, big, big money is available's what Will the English says.
Moloko-plus.
Enough is remembered though, little Alex. Dim and Georgie laugh. They drag Alex to a low water through.
Yes, I heard. D'you know what time he got in last night?
No I don't know, luv, I'd taken my sleepers.
I wonder where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings.
Well, it's a surprise all right, a bit bewildering too.
We've only just read about it in the morning papers.
Well, what's the matter lad, are you feeling alright?
D'you think we should do something?
Hullo, son, how are you?
How many to a cell?
Four in this block, sir.
Cram criminals together and what do you get - concentrated criminality... crime in the midst of punishment.
I agree, sir. What we need are larger prisons. More money.
Well, fine... we could still look at C-Block.
Shall we go to my office?
Hi ya' doin'? Where to?
I'll take Sixth. It's faster.
What?
Sixth is faster.
Sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day.
The Bowery, you gotta deal with runoff from two bridges.
Sixth, you got delivery trucks blocking traffic at Herald Square. Look, I make this trip all the time.
But Bowery's fine, if that's what you want.
We taking bets? What if you're wrong?
The ride is free.
Go ahead, say it.
No. I got lucky with the lights.
You like Bach?
I used to play this piece back in high school.
Let me guess. Clarinet?
Violin. I never had the lungs for wind instruments.
Could'a fooled me, the way you were hollering into that cell phone.
Different instrument altogether. You know, if you'd only listened to me, we'd be bogged down in traffic right now, and you could have made yourself an extra five bucks.
Keep it. Go wild. Have a party.
Why'd you do that? Don't tell me you're a gentleman, Max. I thought chivalry was dead as a necessary consequence of gender politics...
It's no big deal.
No? How many cabbies get you into an argument to save you money?
You're an anomaly in today's world, Max. You're good at what you do, so you must take pride in it...?
This? Temporary. To pay the bills and save. I got plans...
Like what?
You like being a lawyer?
You psychic?
Sure. I'm starting an 800 hotline. Caught part of your phone call. And even if I hadn't, there's the dark pinstripe, Armani, elegant, not too hip, which rules out advertising, plus a top-of-the-line briefcase that you live out of, looks like Bottega...
Bottega.
Not quite. He did defense. I'm a prosecutor...
Big case?
You never answered my question. You like what you do?
Most of the time.
But not now?
Like you, I'm good at it. But at this exact moment in time...like I gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning.
You need a vacation.
Just had one.
Not in a cab... I mean a disconnection...get your head straight...you know, get it together...
When was the last time you took one?
Soon. But I take little ones all the time. Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean.
How often you go?
No, no way, I couldn't take that...
Thanks for everything, Max. Wow...
Annie...it's Max.
Max...
Max, the cab driver!
Max? Oh... ...it's kind of a strange time to be calling...
Listen to me! Just listen, okay? There's a man, Vincent, he's coming to kill you!
He's...what? Say again? We're in cell hell...
<u>Kill</u> you! He's coming to kill you!
If this is a joke, it's not funny.
Did you say <u>Dmitri?</u> How do you know about my case? I don't understand...
...okay, Max, I believe you...I'll get out of the building...
...he's two floors below you.
In my office?
Where are you, what floor?
Seventh, files section. What should I do?
He doesn't know you're up there! Just stay right where you are! Call the police!
Max, I'm scared. Are you sure?
This your current address?
A deer?
Comin' over Coldwater. Goddamn deer jumps out in front of me. You believe that?
You still carrying passengers?
I was heading back to my garage. It's on the way.
Come on, it's been a long, shitty day. How about a break? I'll call a tow truck myself, I swear. I won't budge from this spot.
You dizzy? You want to sit down?
I'm...fine. Fine.
...I was just a young cat back then, about nineteen, bussin' tables in this very place. Didn't pay but shit, but that wasn't the point. Being around the music, that was the thing. And I was. Take this one night...July 22, 1964...who walks in? Mr. Louis Armstrong.
You're kidding me.
Right through those doors. The man himself.
Jesus...
He'd come over from Queens to do the Ed Sullivan show. After, he decides to come on up to Harlem and hang with the common folk. That's how he was, you see. Never forgot where he came from. Money and fame an' all that? Meant nothin', long as he could blow that horn. So before you it, he's up on that stage, doin' his
Was it great? Better than great, it had to be...
Like Winton Marsalis says, it was pure, spiritual essence. Louis was playing. God was smiling.
You heard Armstrong play live. I've never been this jealous. You get to talk to him?
No.
Oh, my, yes.
Get outta here! You and Louis?
Fella owned this place back then, Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played. So Pops, he just waves me right up. My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes.
Remember what you played?
Most vividly. "St. Louis Blues," "Potato Head Blues," "Sleepy Time Down South..." ...then Pops laid some "Cornet Chop Suey" on me, and left me in the dust like a whipped dog.
The crowd had to dig it.
You know Dmitri?
And here I was thinking you were such a nice guy.
What kind of question?
Jazz question. What other kind is there? You get it right, we roll with it. You disappear. Tonight. You don't go home, you don't pack a bag, you just leave town...and nobody, I mean nobody, ever hears from you or sees you again.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
One more thing. If by some chance I get this wrong...tell Dmitri I'm sorry.
Lay it on me.
It's simple. What was your pal Louis' first musical instrument?
I know the answer. I know all there is to know about Louis.
I see. That was an important list, wouldn't you say? The people on that list are being subpoenaed tomorrow by a federal judge. And you "lost" it?
I'm sorry.
Tell me, Vincent. Do you believe in Santa Claus?
Can't say that I do.
Tell me Vincent. Tell me what you think.
What?
I think... ...I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.
What? What did you say?
I picked up a tail.
Federal?
You think I wanted to come here tonight? You think I'm that stupid? Sometimes shit happens, you gotta roll with it.
Tell me. Has Black Peter already crossed off a few bad children?
The fat man on Cherry Street. The other fat man, Mr. Bulldozer. The trumpet player. That leaves two.
Can you finish on schedule?
Vincent. Do not cross me.
As a token of my appreciation for your understanding in this matter, I'd like to offer you a discount for my services tonight. Twenty five percent.
Twenty five?
Hell, make it fifty. Same goes for any business we have in the future.
Very generous.
Something going on?
...goddamn it, you telling me this motherfucker's whacked three of our witnesses tonight...
Advance team, two men, stick to that goddamn cab, stay in radio contact, the rest of us follow in the van. Nobody moves until the entire team's in place...
...got off the phone with his dispatcher. What an asshole. Cabbie's name is Max Rilke, been driving that cab for ten years...
So?
...so, his description of Max the cabdriver matches the guy who walked out of Villa Rodeo. That guy? That guy is a cabbie. And you're telling me this cabbie walks into a phone booth and emerges as a meat eater, assassin with heavy trigger time? What's he do, squeeze 'em in between fares?
Lemme tell you something. Vincent and a few other guys like him are fucking ghosts. Nobody even know what he looked like until now...
What are you gonna do?
...this snitch of yours, what's his name, Ivan?
Ivan Petrov. Supposed to meet me for dinner, never shows up. I come here, find this.
You guys been holding hands?
Months now. He's been feeding me information on Dmitri.
Dmitri <u>Gusunov?</u> What the fuck, why? Forget about Dimitri, Feds are all over him. They're a heartbeat away from taking him down. Word's gone out, they don't want us anywhere near him...
Oh, we working for the Feds now? If my snitch flew out a window, he's got Dmitri's handprints on his ass. That makes it homicide, that makes it ours.
There was a car here, you can see where the glass came down all around it. Ivan flew out the window and went bam.
Remember that thing a few years back? That thing with the cab?
What thing?
Cabbie drove around all night. Three people got killed.
Oh, right. The guy flipped out or something? Killed some people, then put a gun to his own head?
They found him dead in his own cab down by the Port Authority.
So? It was a random thing.
I never bought that.
Oh?
...yeah, I'm still at Bellevue. The John Doe didn't pan out, but you'll never guess who's lying up in the meat locker.
Elvis?
Joey Cicerno. Dear friend and associate of my missing snitch, Ivan Petrov. Both of whom were in bed with Dmitri.
Jesus. Two in one night?
Something big's going down, and I'm betting the Feds don't know about it. You gotta get us in there.
Captain Walt Muldoon, NYPD.
What if they're wrong?
Not our call, Phil.
...if they're wrong?!
Why didn't you tell me we had company? And what's your name?
Happy to meet you, Mrs. Rilke.
I was with Max when he got the call.
And you came all the way down here to see me?
It's nothing.
Tell my son. You have to hold a gun to his head to get him to come see me.
Client? I like to think of myself as more of a friend. A mentor.
I'm sure you're very proud of Max.
Quite an achievement...
What's your name?
I'm in town for a short time.
Try?
Hi, Ma.
I've been calling and calling.
I got caught up at work.
You couldn't pick up a phone? I'm lying here, wondering if something horrible happened...
I brought you flowers.
What am I gonna do with flowers?
You're gonna cheer up.
By worrying about you spending money on foolish things? So I can watch them wilt?
You paid for my flowers? They're beautiful. Max, you gonna introduce us?
I'm...in...the...room, here. Don't talk about me like I'm not in the room.
What's he sayin'?
I'm standing right here.
I came to see you, you look fine. We gotta go.
Oh. Oh, thank God, hey! Hey, guys, hey, help me out here!
Yo, whassup?
You're kidding me.
I'll fuck you up, you don't hand it over.
...oh God, don't shoot me...
I know you're out there! Answer the goddamn call!
He's not paying you one cent!
Vincent <u>Farrell</u>, Assistant U.S. Attorney. A passenger in this taxicab, and I'm reporting you to the DMV...
Let's not get excited, sir.
How am I supposed to not get excited, listening to you trying to extort your employee, you sarcastic prick?
I was just tryin' to...to...
Max? Maaax. Pick up, dipshit.
Jesus, what is with this guy?
You hassling my driver again?
Who is this?
Same fare you talked to last time. The U.S. Attorney...
What are you guys, taking an all-night tour?
We're gay lovers, what's it to you?
Nothin'! Aside from Max's mother driving me crazy, I'm dancin' on a rainbow! Get him on the line, please.
He'll keep calling.
Uh, yeah? Lenny? It's me.
Yeah? So?
<u>So?</u> Aside from I hate talking to cops, they tell me you crashed the shit out of it.
It got crashed! I didn't...
Yeah?
...why is everything always about you...
...everything is not about me, don't make me the villain here. That asshole was out of line, and you goddamn well know it...
...I'm sorry, I don't see it that way...
...oh, bullshit! He was intruding on my space, he was demeaning me personally, he was patronizing...
...what do you want me to do, punch him out? I have to work with him...
Hello?
Uh, let's go to... Hello...?
How long you think this'll take?
Twenty-four minutes.
Twenty-four? Not twenty-five? Or twenty-three?
Mind if I time you? What do I get if you're wrong? A free ride?
First time in New York?
Third, but I still can't tell uptown from downtown. Tell the truth, whenever I'm here, I can't wait to leave. Place gets to me. Too loud, too fast...too much. You like it here?
It's home.
You share it with over three million people every day. You know that's the population of New Zealand? What's Manhattan, thirteen miles long? That's a lot of misery crammed into thirteen miles. Read about this one guy. Gets on the subway and dies. Six hours he's riding around before anybody notices. Think about that. Here's this corpse doing laps around Manhattan courtesy of the
You know, this is the cleanest cab I've ever been in. This your regular ride?
Yeah. I share it with the dayshift guy.
You prefer nights?
People are more relaxed. Less stress, less traffic, better tips.
You on some kind of work plan?
You mean like benefits?
Yeah. Retirement? Paid sick leave?
It's not that kind of job.
You should start a union.
Me, specifically?
Why not?
Last thing I need is a reason to keep hacking. This job's a fill-in.
Oh? How long you been doing this?
Twelve years. But I'm working on other stuff...
Like what?
I don't talk about it, you know... No offense.
Twenty-four minutes! Man, you're hot...
Yeah. Lucky with the lights.
Bullshit. You probably know the light schedules, too. Listen, I'm in town tonight on a closing. Five stops, one night. I gotta catch a six a.m. flight. I got five stops to make, see some friends, collect some signatures. Why don't you hang with me?
I'm not a hire car. It's against regs?
Regulations? These guys don't even give you sick leave. How much you pull down on a good night?
Two, two-fifty.
We have a deal. What's your name?
Max.
He fell on my cab! From up th-th-there.
You always stutter?
I think he's dead.
You - you killed him?
You cool, Max? Say "I'm cool."
You're cool.
No. You say you're cool.
Good. Help me out here.
With what?
You were going to drive me around. Drop me at LAX. Never be the wiser. But El Gordo missed the elevator. So we go to Plan B. Pop the trunk.
The trunk?
I'm gonna roll him off the hood. Always lift with your legs...
I don't think I can do this.
Got it?
What?
His hand moved! His goddamn hand twitched!
Uh, look...why don't you just take the car...
Max. May we leave the scene of the crime now, please.
Max.
You listening to me?
Yes! I'm trying, I swear!
Try harder. I'm gonna count to three. One...
Two...
What about that?
I tried it.
How about the thingy next to it?
The thingy next to it has nothing to do with the starter motor...
I'm making <u>you</u> nervous. I'm the one with a schedule.
Try some deep breathing.
What?
You better?
What are you doing?
It's a mess.
58th and Central. You know it?
South Central.
Oh. Oh, no. You're kidding. We...
I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
You said you were visiting friends!
They're <u>somebody's</u> friends... You drive a cab. I kill people. We both do our jobs right, you might survive the night and come out four hundred bucks ahead.
Listen. I'm not trying to piss you off, see? Okay? I can't drive you around so you can murder folks.
Tonight it is.
Are you breathing?
Yes.
Music.
Chopin prelude. Stodgy, but nice. Here's the deal. I didn't want you involved in this. Still breathing? But now that you are, we have to make the best of it, Max. Improvise. Life is that way. Adapt to your environment. Survive. Darwin. "Shit happens." The I Ching. Whatever. Roll with it.
I Ching? You threw a man out a window!
I didn't throw him, he fell.
What'd he do to you?
Nothing. I only met him the one time.
How can you kill him like that?
I should only kill people after I get to know 'em? Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
Who was he?
What do you care? Ever hear of Rwanda?
Rwanda-Burundi. Central Africa.
I don't know any Rwandans.
You don't know the guy in the trunk, either. If it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise.
Oh, it's okay, then. 'Cause you're just taking out the garbage...
Get rid of 'em.
How?
Please. Don't do anything.
Then don't let me get cornered, Max. You don't have the trunk space.
I can't believe this.
I'll talk to them, I'll talk to them.
That one's probably married. Think of his kids. His wife's pregnant...
Hands on the wheel. Ten and two o'clock, like they taught you in driver's ed.
Why?
Who's that?
It was an accident. You're not liable. Tell him.
Don't take that. Tell him to shut the fuck up.
I can't do that. He's the Man. He'll fire my ass.
So what?
I need the job.
Lenny? You're an asshole.
Tell him next time he pulls any shit, you're gonna kick his fat ass.
I had no idea these cabs came equipped with emergency strobes. Where's the button? Under the dash?
Another collateral.
What?
Collateral damage.
I don't understand...
Vincent?
Yes, Max?
But, hey, some good news. This last one put me way ahead of schedule. We've actually got some time to kill. Jazz? You like jazz?
I'm...what? Sorry?
Jazz. Music.
I listen to classical.
...see now, this has got a little post- war flavor, a little Miles thing happening. Awesome. What do you think?
I never learned jazz.
God, are you always this prosaic? You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're <u>taught.</u> It's like breathing, like life. Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow.
That what we're doing? Flowing?
Damn right. Instinct, man. If you think too much, it doesn't work. Just listen...
I'm not catching a melody.
Let him go, Vincent.
You mind? I'm working here.
You're the one who keeps talking about going with the flow. You like the man, you like the way he plays. How about a little jazz, huh?
Let's go.
No.
What you mean, no?
Max? What are you doing?
Leave me alone.
Don't even think you're walking away from me.
Pull your head out of your ass. Get your thinking straight. You wanna die?
I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
Teach him how to talk back, suddenly he can't stop. I'm not playing.
Show up for what?
Show up for <u>what?</u>
She's in the hospital.
You go every night?
What difference does it make?
Guy with a routine goes and breaks it? Provokes attention. That's bad. And that's not good...
Mom, Vincent's not interested.
You take one more step, I'll kill her.
What the fuck was <u>that?</u>
Limos, huh?
Don't start.
Hey, I'm not the one who's been lying to my mother.
She hears what she wants to hear, okay?
Maybe so. Maybe she hears what you tell her.
Fuck! Nothing's ever goddamn good enough! It's always been that way.
It's cause they don't like their lives, so they project their patterns of negative behavior onto you... I had a father like that.
Yeah? What happened?
He hated everything I did. Hated me. Got drunk and beat the shit out of me, daily...
What happened?
I killed him. When I was 15. He was my first. Nah, wishful thinking. Liver cancer.
I'm sorry.
Don't be. I never saw him after I was 15. Went into the military early. So all this talk about "my job's temporary, I got big plans," it's all bullshit.
It's not bullshit.
What do <u>you</u> call it? Ten years doesn't sound temporary to me. I should have known it was bullshit, you're too good at what you do.
I've always been good. Ever since I started. Gave up piano. Easy money. I'm putting a stake together, get something started. Go figure it all out...
Yeah? Like what? Limos?
I told you I don't like to talk about it.
Well, this big stake's got to be big by now. When you leaving?
See, I've got bills. My mother's been dying of the same disease since I was a kid.
What, no insurance?
Doesn't cover everything.
Gimme your wallet.
I'll just hold onto it for you. In case they check.
Our friends in Little Russia. Go in and ask for a man named Dmitri.
Dmitri?
The man who hired me for this contract.
I don't get it.
You're gonna be me. You're gonna go in, and you're gonna get the info on the remaining two hits.
Why me? Why don't <u>you</u> do it?
No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way. Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it.
He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?
When he finds out you tossed his list? I would.
No. No way. I can't do this.
Max. You threw my briefcase in the river. You've got balls bigger than Toledo.
I...I wasn't thinking. I just did it.
Vincent. Don't make me do this. Don't make me get people killed.
How long have you been a hit man?
Why?
In case he asks.
Fifteen years, although I prefer the term "assassin."
You get benefits?
No.
Paid sick leave?
Damn, Max. I'm impressed. Really. I would have bet good money you wouldn't walk out of there.
Washington and Holt. Dance club called "Fever." Know it?
Tribeca, near the waterfront, northeast corner. Twelve minutes.
Would you have called her?
Who?
Your lady friend. The one who gave you her business card. Think she was just being polite?
I don't know.
What holds you back, Max? Tell me. Why does life scare you so much?
I only owe you a ride, Vincent.
Good. Blood, urine and death get to you? Try deep breathing. Or remember we all die anyway...
You had to kill Heller?!
Who's Heller?
That cop! Why'd you have to do that? You couldn't wound him? The guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me...
I shoulda saved him 'cause he <u>believed</u> you?
No, not just that.
Yeah, that.
Yeah, so, what's wrong with that?
It's what I do for a living.
Some living.
Head towards Union Station.
What's at Union Station?
How are you at math? I was hired for five hits. I did four.
One more.
There you go...!
Whyn't you kill me and find another cab.
You're too good. We're in this together. Fates intertwined. Cosmic coincidence and all that crap...
You're full of shit.
<u>I'm</u> full of shit? You're a monument of bullshit. You even bullshitted yourself all I am, is taking out the garbage. Bad guys killing bad guys...
That's what you said...
And you believe me...?
What'd they do?
How do I know? But, they all got that "witnesses for the prosecution" look to me. Probably some major federal indictment against somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted... I dunno.
That's the reason?
That's the "why." That's the why? There is no reason. No good reason; no bad reason. To live or to die.
Then what are you?
Get with it. Get over it. ...millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars and a speck on one in a blink...that's us. Lost in space. The universe doesn't care. The cop, you, me? Who notices?
What happened to you?
As in...?
Man, if someone had a gun to your head and said: "You gotta tell me what's goin' on with that person over there or I'll kill you"...they'd have to kill you... 'Cause you don't have a clue for...or about...anyone... To be like that, I don't think you, you have any of that for your own life... Do you believe you're entitled or at least
...all the cabbies in LA, I pull Max, the man with X-ray vision...
Answer the question.
Look in the mirror. ...piss-ant paper towels...a bottle of 409...saving up for goin' to the Comoros. How much you got saved?
None of your business.
'Cause I never got it straightened up; made the push, made the moves...
Slow down.
You're going too fast.
Slow the hell down!
What are you gonna do, pull the trigger? Kill us? Go ahead, man! <u>Shoot</u>...my ass.
Slow down!
Well. That was brilliant.
Max?
What happened?
They said send you downstairs.
Who?
The F.B.I., the C.I.A. You name the initials and they're down there.
Any special reason?
The sound of love.
That's love.
Love? Love's just a pretty way of saying, 'I want to sleep with you'. Love is bullshit.
Love gives you wings. It makes you fly. I don't even call it love. I call it Geronimo.
Geronimo?
Geronimo. When you're really in love, you'll jump. Off the top of the Empire State. Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.
But you'll die. You'll squash yourself. What's the point?
She must be some girl.
I never told her.
Why the hell not?
Are you crazy?!
The guy came right at us!
I was only going one way.
Drop me off here!
Look, I'm sorry --
What're you thinking, Jerry?
Water mains usually go in the winter. It's August 1st.
Tell you what. Reminds me of life in the Delta.
Mississippi?
Mekong, my friend, Mekong.
You know, Flip, Vietnam War was fought because of a bet Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onasis.
Sure. And the two of 'em used my legs for a wishbone. Nearly snapped me in half.
<u>Jerry</u>? You didn't show last night. First time ever. Had me worried, boy.
Saved you last night's, too.
Flip was a hero in Vietnam.
Flip. You're the closest thing I got to a friend around here. Tell me something. You think I'm crazy?
I don't see the connection.
Come on! Six major earthquakes in the last three years? The space shuttle in orbit for every one of them?
Testing some top secret seismic weapon.
I still don't see what it has to do with the President.
Do you still ride?
Not for years.
So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
The President's in Europe. Tomorrow he'll be in Turkey. Right along this fault line. They launched the space shuttle yesterday.
Motive?
He's cutting funding for NASA. The milk cow of the aerospace industry. We're talking billions. Motive enough?
<u>NASA</u> is going to kill the President of the United States with an earthquake.
You going to warn him?
I can't promise you anything.
You think I'm crazy.
I think you're different.
You know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy <u>against yourself</u>. I can't lie to me, Liza. And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to people like you. Can't you see that's what they're counting on? You want to go out
I better get going.
What was your horse's name?
Johnny Dancer. You've been in my office ten times. How come you never asked me about that picture before?
I bit the bastard's nose off.
You bit someone's nose off?
It's a man without a nose you want, you dumb complicit sons of bitches! You've got to listen to me.
Put down the gun and I'll take your statement. Okay?
What's the charge?
Just relax.
Switch the charts.
Switch 'em. Or I'll be dead by morning. Don't want to be dead.
Hey... I can't control it. It's just, something that happened.
What is?
People do have heart attacks.
It's okay. The guy traded bullets with some old man in a liquor store. He had it coming.
You expect me to believe what, that someone came in here last night. Gave that guy... something that stopped his heart?
You switched the charts; you tell me.
I got to get downstairs. The C.I.A., they want to see your body.
I won't be here when you get back, but I'll be in touch. And thanks.
For what?
You saved my life.
He says a dog bit his nose.
Arf... You gotta help me.
Lucky guess... Um, I'd feel a lot less naked if we could get outta here.
Don't tell me you're naked back there.
What took so long? You were in there all day.
That's how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out. A lot of people are after you, Jerry.
Dead or alive, they'll stick me in there with Oswald. Another lunatic acting alone,
Oswald was an assassin. You're not an assassin, are you, Jerry?
If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.
Right. Sit up so I can see you.
Uh uh, don't want <u>them</u> to see me.
Them who?
Flat, wraparound headlights?
Yeah.
Crown Victoria. F.B.I. car. A legitimate tail.
As opposed to?
People more serious about their work. You know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it?
You mean I should speed up and try and lose them?
Yes.
That's how a man would do it. I'm not a man.
See? Wasn't that a lot easier than squealing tires and knocking over trash cans?
Nothing is easy.
How long have we known each other, Jerry?
Six months. Eleven days.
You have the right to ask me certain personal questions?
Nothing scary there. Sorry.
More about life on Mars. From a rock they <u>found</u> on the South Pole. Explain that one to me. But maybe we should go to Mars and find out? How much do you think that's going to cost?
What is it with you and the space program?
Well that's the eye right there. <u>Money</u>. And all the power and misery it brings with it. It's a plot to take over the world. The Master Conspiracy. Can take a lifetime to pull off.
That's it?
So why are they after you?
I'm not sure. I think I figured something out. It must've been in my newsletter.
So I'm a little jumpy. Who wouldn't be?
You're certifiable.
You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.
You okay?
You know why the Grateful Dead are always on tour?
Surprise me.
You want something to drink?
If my universe had a hub...
Equitation.
I've been reading up on it.
Here it is. <u>Conspiracy Theory</u> It just went out Tuesday. Third issue this year. I bet I struck a nerve. Pissed someone off.
'The Space Shuttle's Seismic Secret'. 'The Oliver Stone-George Bush Connection'. Oliver Stone?
Stone is their spokesman. You think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that they'd let him do it? Stone's a disinformation flunky. The face that he's alive says it all.
Can you prove any of this?
'On July 8, 1979, security forces under control of the Trilateral Commission abducted the fathers of all American Nobel Prize winners. The men, many of them octogenarians, were forced at gunpoint to ejaculate into small plastic bottles. The sperm collected is now under study in a laboratory beneath the headquarters of the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, California.'
Pretty scary, huh?
Yeah... how many subscribers do you have?
Just five. It's the economy... You think maybe one of them is not who they seem?
You're a Holden Caulfield fan.
Who?
Holden Caulfield? <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
Never heard of him.
You have ten copies of the book, but you don't know who the main character is?
What are you doing?
Was that who I thought it was?
Uh huh.
Has this happened to you before?
Never, but I've been practicing.
Who are you, Jerry?
You gave me an hour; now give me a day.
Jerry, there's something I have to ask you. Actually about a hundred things, but we can make progress, if you answer one question. To my satisfaction.
Shoot.
It was that painting. The one on the wall.
I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context. Know what I mean?
It made me feel like you could see inside of me. And I don't know how that's possible.
So what's the question?
I'll give you 100 bucks if you leave right now.
Is this your dad?
That was him.
Is he dead?
Please put it down.
How'd he die?
He's why you punish yourself.
Not this again.
You run with your back to the picture. Like you were trying to get away. Once in awhile you sing along with music, but mostly you punish yourself.
Johnny Dancer, right? You don't ride him anymore, do you? Not since your dad died.
Did you see the van back there?
What van?
Never mind. You'd think I was making it up.
Where'd you get your subscribers?
I put an ad on a computer bulletin board. I log on at the library so I can't be traced.
Well, I've been tracking them down all morning.
You haven't been bothering them, have you?
They're dead. Four out of five anyhow. All in the last 24 hours. One car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke.
Jesus... It's my fault. They drew a black line over me and now I'm passing it on. I'm passing it to you, too.
I'll be fine. Let's worry about Henry Finch. P.O. Box in St. Louis. He's the last on the list. I haven't been able to reach him yet.
Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse. I should have realized.
Realized what?
Elaborate on 'they,' okay?
There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials. But they're all part of two warring factions. One: families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing. Stability. Group Two: the boat rockers. Eisenhower's military industrial complex. They want instability. It's a trillion dollar a year business. When there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one.
Cold War's over, Jerry.
So now they feed us terrorists. <u>To create fear</u>. How much do you think an airport security system goes for? Then multiply it by every airport in the country.
And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.
Latest casualty? Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.
His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered.
Murdered?
Right here in Manhattan.
It said in the paper he drowned in a swimming pool. <u>In Newport</u>.
Nobody dies in Newport. They couldn't even kill Sunny von Bulow there. Harriman drowned, but it wasn't in Newport.
Right here. In the 7th Street subway station.
What was he doing down here? A billionaire waiting for the subway? Why not drown him in a bus? Why drown him at all? Why not shoot him? Is the hitman from the lost world of Atlantis? I mean, come on.
I see the big picture and you stumble around in the details.
They're big details, Jerry.
Do you watch the news? Read the paper. Last week, this whole place was underwater.
A water main broke.
They don't break in the summer! Do you know what building is right over this spot? Harriman Tower. Their sub-basement was flooded! He didn't die in a pool. Call the coroner in Rhode Island! Ask if the water in his lungs was chlorinated!
Okay, I will.
You will?
I don't know what to say. I love you.
I -- It's like, I resolve to call you up 1000 times a day. To ask you if you'll marry me in some old-fashioned way. Everything you do is magic.
Those are song lyrics, Jerry.
I know that. I'm just -- I'm nervous. I reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. I know they're song lyrics. And I know how I feel.
I like you, Jerry. A lot.
Oh, Christ, here it comes. Look, I know you think I'm crazy. I don't think I am, but...
Jerry, I --
What if I reached a point where you didn't think I was crazy anymore? If I was normal.
If you were eating Kentucky Fried Chicken and drinking Coca-Cola again.
Yeah... Would you, I mean, could you love me then? If I was normal. Maybe?
You're wrong. Since I met you, I don't dream about holes anymore.
Holes? I don't know what you're talking about.
Yesterday you were wondering about the wall. How it was possible.
Now's not really the time to get into this --
Answer me. Was the first time you saw me the first time I saw you? Was it? You've been following me around. Do you see how that could be disconcerting to me? That's not love, Jerry. It's obsession. And it isn't normal and you can't expect me to respond to it and you can't expect me to feel the same way. Can you?
I would never hurt you, Liza. Think whatever you want, but don't think that.
I don't. I know you wouldn't.
You look great.
Are you okay? I wish I hadn't told you what I did. But I can't help the way I feel. You don't hold that against me, do you?
No. That wouldn't be fair. Where are we going, Jerry?
What is it?
We're going to Queens?
Now what?
After you. It's okay. I'm the one who left it here.
Where are we going, Jerry?
Connecticut.
What about them?
How come serial killers have two names, but lone gunman assassins have three. John <u>Wilkes</u> Booth. Mark <u>David</u> Chapman. Lee <u>Harvey</u> Oswald.
John Hinkley. The guy who shot Reagan. He only had two names.
My father's house.
How do you really know there's gold in Fort Knox? Just because they say so? We should go to Tennessee and demand to see it.
Liza?
Did you kill him?
Is that what they told you?
Then why did you have his picture in your safe deposit box?
He gave it to me.
I don't understand.
Where were you the day he died?
At a horse show.
That's the last time you rode, isn't it? Do you think it was your fault? Is that why?
Did you kill my father?!
Jerry. Please. You don't understand. I have to know. It's all I think about. Do you have any idea what it's like not to know?
Yeah. I know what it's like.
Then tell me what happened.
Can't give you the details because I can't remember. I went to court to kill him. At the Ezekiel Walters hearing. I was supposed to shoot him at the press conference. You were there. That's the first time I saw you.
Love at first sight?
I don't know what it was. All I know is I had a gun in my hand, but when I saw you standing with him, I couldn't do it. If that's love, it's not so bad. I found a part of myself that day. I couldn't go back.
Back where?
Someone else might call it stalking. My dad felt it. He started carrying a gun.
He kept it in the side table in the front hallway. He showed me. I visited a few times. Then one of Jonas's guys visited. When I arrived, your dad was dying.
Why? What do these guys have to do with Ezekiel Walters?
Walters was their fall guy. Blow up a building and blame a nut. Create fear. Don't you see? Your father wasn't trying to keep Walters in prison. He was looking into getting him out. He didn't believe the official story.
<u>Why not, Jerry</u>?
How'd you get the picture?
I believe you.
You got to get out of here. My cell phone's on. Back in the truck.
They'll trace it.
I'm sorry.
Blue moon... Blue moon...
Blue moon...
Without a song in my heart.
Blue moon...
Liza?
How did you know?
Get in. I'll pull you up to the fourth floor.
What about you?
Geronimo is down.
It's up. Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.
Don't die on me, Jerry. Okay?
You've been my best friend for years and I didn't even know you were out there.
They changed Franklin's portrait.
You think it's a conspiracy?
I love you, too.
Do I know you?
I'm a very patient man.
That's great. Good for you.
Who have you been talking to, Jerry? Who else knows what you know?
What's that?
We've arranged for you to take the blame. Everyone knows how you've been harassing the poor girl.
<u>Liza</u>!
You shouldn't watch, Jerry. It's a moment without hope.
Liza Sutton is dead.
Thank you.
You're welcome. Where's my partner?
I like that. A gun to your head and you ask about your partner. He's okay. May have a headache for a few days. Are you here with honorable intentions?
I'm not sure what you mean.
You should think of me as Liza Sutton's guardian angel.
That's ironic. Because we're here to protect her from you.
You're here because you figured I might show up.
It seemed like a possibility. What about your intentions? Are they honorable?
I'm not a violent man, Mr. Lowry. Not by nature, anyhow. But if you hurt Liza in any way, I'll kill you. Does that seem honorable?
You made your decision yet?
I'm leaning toward no.
I'll do it. On one condition. I want to make sure she's okay.
We got someone watching her 24 hours a day. She --
That's not what I mean. I want to see her.
I don't know...
Then screw you. I'll rot.
Alright. You can see her. But she can't see you.
Can I ask you something?
A dog bit it.
Excuse me?
You were going to ask about my nose. The poor animal is slated to be destroyed today.
And you feel bad for it?
So he thinks NASA is plotting to kill the President?
You already asked me that. Why do you insist on making me repeat myself?
And you have no idea where he lives?
You've asked me that one three times.
Here's a fresh one. Why you? Your colleague Mr. Wilson says Jerry won't speak to anyone else. That seems oddly possessive behavior to me.
I'm sorry. What was the question again?
<u>Why you</u>?
Honestly? I think he has a crush on me.
A charming term. Now, <u>why him</u>?
Excuse me?
Jerry's visits to your office. Why do you tolerate them? Why him?
Veritas. Truth. What is it they say about truth?
The truth shall make you free.
That's it. I went to Yale. I hope you won't hold that against me.
I didn't know the C.I.A. had psychiatrists.
We're very specialized.
Brain washing, mind control, that sort of thing?
If you're as impressed to see me as I am to see you, you're very impressed indeed. How's Jerry feeling this morning?
Fine. What the hell is going on?
What I'm about to tell you is partially documented. The Freedom of Information Act saw to that. But much more of it isn't. For reasons which will soon be regrettably clear, I'm going to share -- secrets -- with you. Repeat any of it and you'll simply bestow the title of 'paranoid' upon yourself.
Years ago, I worked for the C.I.A. in the M.K. ULTRA program. Are you familiar with it?
It was mind control. <u>Manchurian</u> <u>Candidate</u> kind of stuff, right?
A vulgar pop term, but yes. Take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin. That was our goal.
Ask what you can do for your country. That kind of thing.
M.K. ULTRA was terminated in 1973. But not the research. It was renamed. EX CATCHER.
As in <u>Catcher in the Rye</u>?
We experimented with hallucinogens. We used electro- shock to produce a vegetative state. We conducted terminal experiments in sensory deprivation.
Terminal?
As in 'resulting in death.' We pushed the envelope until it wasn't even an envelope anymore.
If I had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, I'd arrest you right here.
Me? I was a minor missionary, a heretic really. But where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, cheat, steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the All-Highs? Besides, now I'm trying to pay my penance.
Missionary? Penance? You talk about it like it was a religion.
Jerry told me he bit your nose.
And what did I say?
A dog.
<u>My dog</u>. One I intend to put to sleep. Extrapolate from there.
These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?
I'm still listening.
Jerry is dangerous. Jerry has killed --
Belief is immaterial. What's important is the truth... It's been my job to find Jerry. I'm very much responsible for him.
If this was a spy novel, your next words would be something like I now know too much to live. Why are you telling me all this?
Where'd you get it?
You do recognize it then?
It was my father's. Kept it in his wallet. He was murdered --
I know the story. A federal judge. He denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial.
Not a man. Ezekiel Walters.
Walters had nothing to do with your father's murder.
In Jerry's safety deposit box.
It's okay. I'm game.
So, you doing anything tonight?
Working.
Hmm, how about tomorrow night?
Working.
Night after that?
Look, you're a nice guy, but I'm not really dating right now.
I'm not that good at 'no,' Liza.
Liza, settle a bet for us.
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
I need to speak with an Agent Lowry.
The office is closed for the evening. Is this an emergency?
Yes.
Go ahead, Miss Sutton.
Ah, your psychotic is here.
Tell him I'm on vacation. That I won't be back for two weeks.
I've been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to Jerry Fletcher. We're not to discuss him with the press, the N.Y.P.D., anyone. Building police are to arrest him on sight and we're to report any attempt he makes to contact you.
This doesn't make sense.
It makes perfect sense. Field work is not our oeuvre.
I don't like it. Something's wrong.
Dr. Jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate. Why is that?
We don't know who Jonas is. We don't know who it is we're cooperating with.
I've had a lot of credentials flashed in my face, Liza. What I saw yesterday, I know not to ask questions. We're out. Shut off. Terminated. <u>Understood</u>?
Go to the northeast corner. Call a cab. Bring the pizza. Then there's a poem. Roses are red, violets are blue, if the Pope goes to Washington, I would, too.
We're waiting for jurisdictional problems to be cleared up. This guy Fletcher's something else.
Tell me about it.
While we walk. D.C. police want him for assault. Secret Service for counterfeiting and we're tracking him on a string of bank robberies. No one knows what the C.I.A. wants him for.
Guy's a C.I.A. shrink. Here to I.D. Fletcher. They knew each other somehow.
Which way did he go?
That's the book Hinkley had on him when he shot Reagan.
You're welcome! Spooks. So, you want to compare notes on this guy.
Agent Lowry.
Wasn't my idea.
Jonas?
When I'm ready to compare notes, I'll let you know.
Can I talk to you a second?
Do you believe me?
Yeah, I do.
I want to believe you, too.
Who's the Deputy Director of the F.B.I.?
What gave me away?
I'm, it really doesn't matter. Think C.I.A. and exponentiate. I'm a government employee and I've been watching Jerry for awhile.
And Jonas?
He's why I watch Jerry. Jerry's the bait for Jonas.
He's shown himself. Why haven't you arrested him or killed him or done whatever it is you do?
Jonas builds assassins for a living. Several of whom may be in place already. We'd like to kill a few birds with one stone.
Where do you think Jerry is?
No idea. Honest. What are you going to do?
I'm going to find him. Because he'd find me.
Don't go home. And don't go to work. Either one could be bad.
What do you suggest?
That you come with me.
What?
I'm not sure. We have no launch protocol; the entry of the passenger is supposed to initiate activation.
We have benzel activation, repeat, we have benzel activation. Control to Arroway, you okay in there? Repeat, Control to Arroway, come back.
We've lost contact.
Pull the plug. Get her out of there.
There's no plug to pull.
What?
... And this is how the extraterrestrial presented himself to you? As your father?
Yes, sir.
He died... ... in 1972.
Yes, sir.
Is it possible...?
You don't believe it to be... tell me something, Doctor. Why do you think they would go to all this trouble... bring you tens of thousands of light years, and then send you home without a shred of proof? Sort of bad form, wouldn't you say? What was their intent?
Dr. Arroway --
Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.
Mike, because of the Earth's rotation we're only in line with Vega so many hours a day; the only way to get the whole message is to cooperate with other stations. If Dr. Arroway hadn't moved quickly we could have lost key elements.
Hope there's a cartoon.
What in the hell...?
-- Or 'you're our kind of people --'
Now I remember why I went into theoretical work. Kent.
Glad to have you, David. How's the new office?
Nothing. Okay. Some of us have been a little... not concerned, exactly, but...
Tell me.
Last week, about 3 A.M., Fish -- Dr. Fisher -- was on a late shift, and he found her doing laundry.
So?
I'm sorry, Miss Arroway, not only is it too Speculative a subject for a doctoral dissertation, at this point in your career it'd be tantamount to suicide.
I'm willing to take that risk.
I'm not. You're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense --
Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity. There are over four hundred billion stars out there --
And only two probabilities: One: there is intelligent life in the universe but they're so far away you'll never contact it in your lifetime --
You're --
Two: There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time.
What if you're wrong? No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.
I disagree.
Pepsi? Tequila?
Peter sends his regards.
Oh? How's he doing?
Very well; since my appointment he's been made interim director.
Really? Congratulations, by the way.
I'm surprised you even knew it was an election year.
'President's Science Advisor' -- so what, you just spend all your time jetting around on Air Force One now...?
Now exactly. It's... complicated.
No doubt.
Ellie...
Did I tell you we've expanded the search spectrum? We're including several other possible magic frequencies -- not just the hydrogen line anymore. I was trying to get inside their heads, y'know? And I started thinking, what other constants are there in the Universe besides hydrogen, and then suddenly it was so obvious -- transcendantals, right? So we've been trying variations of pi...
You know why I'm here.
It's not enough having my search time systematically cut down -- you know I'm down to three hours a week now.
Ellie, I should have done this a long time ago, certainly before I left the N.S.F., but I wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt --
You can't just pull the plug, David.
It's not like you've given me much choice.
Meaning...
Meaning I have to go defend a budget to the President and to Congress and you're out here listening to washing machines.
I'm searching for patterns in the noise, that's all. Order in the chaos. I'm practicing listening --
The point is, this isn't just scientific inquiry anymore -- it's turned into some kind of personal obsession.
The difference being what -- that I refuse to adopt the standard line, that I don't care about the results of my work? Well, I do care. Of course any discovery has to be verifiable, of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method, but I refuse to go around pretending I'm some kind of dispassionate automaton when it's obvious to
No... You're not. But the price has just gotten too high.
Goddamnit, they are out there, David --
Then why haven't you detected any signals? If, as you claim, there have been thousands, millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasn't one signal gotten through? It'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through; you're welcome to stay until then.
David --
Mathematics is the only truly universal language, Senator. We think this may be a beacon -- an announcement to get our attention.
If it's attention you want I'd say you've got it. Just one thing: Why Vega? Everyone's looked at Vega for years with no results, and now, yesterday, they start broadcasting primes. Why?
... could it be a nested code of some sort?
Throw a gray scale on it; standard interpolation.
... Arrangements also have to be made for the V.I.P.s coming in, mostly religious leaders...
What? Why?
The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you.
With me.
Apparently he's genuinely interested in science. This could be a chance to win him over.
I'm going to convert Mr. Science-is- the-root-of-all-evil? This is absurd, David. We have work to do here, I don't have time to play babysitter to the God Squad.
I want you to listen to me, carefully. The minute the implications of this message became clear, this stopped being simply a scientific matter and became a political one -- an extremely complex, extremely volatile one. There are forces at work here you don't understand; I can help you up to a point, but only up to a point.
Are you threatening me?
Ms. President, this is communist paranoia right out of War of the Worlds. There is no reason whatsoever to believe the ETIs intentions are hostile. We pose no threat to them -- it would be like us going out of our way to destroy microbes on a beach in Africa.
What is it? What's happened?
We've cracked it. Lunacharsky found it.
You mean --
David --
Ellie.
Do you have a minute -- ?
Actually I'm running late --
David... I know we've had our differences... but I've always thought of you as a fair man, even when we've disagreed -- and It's in that light I'm hoping you'll consider my request...
I don't understand.
I'm asking for your help, David. I want to go. They'll need someone relatively young, unattached -- and probably a scientist. As the President's Science Advisor you have enormous weight... I'm asking if you'll support my candidacy.
Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.
What?
You...
... Two years is still a hell of a long time -- and as far as we can tell there aren't any provisions in the machine design for storing food, water, even air...
They knew our level of development. If, as you say, they've done this many times they'd be well aware of the implications.
You aren't staying?
This... seemed best.
Right. Well.
Ellie... we both know that if I was any kind of a man, I never would've entered this race. That I would have told the President straight out: Helen, Eleanor Arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass... but she's got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together. That more then anyone else on the planet,
What would you have me say, David?
Nothing. I guess I just wanted to thank you.
Thank you?
What does it say?
Because you cut it from the budget three years running.
... And while its function remains, for the moment, a mystery, my best guess is that it represents a transport of some kind.
Mr. Rank's organization represents the point of view of tens of millions of families, Dr. Arroway. Feel free to disagree, but there won't be any suppressing of opinions here today.
What's the status of the decryption effort?
Dr. Lunacharsky...?
What...
In ancient times when parchment was in short supply people would write over old writing... it was called a palimpsest.
There's no way of knowing. Without a key -- a primer, to help us, maybe never.
What?
We've repeated. A few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one.
And?
No primer.
How can that be?
J39 Z186...?
Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.
Got a bogey, boss?
Hydrogen times pi... Got it. Strong sucker.
That can't be right; it's only twenty-six light years away.
How's the spying tonight, guys?
Dr. Cullers?
Kent, Kent for Chrissakes. You must be Eleanor.
Ellie. Pulsar?
1919+21. Found a glitch in the timing; probably a starquake.
Here, right around Centaurus A.
This is how you see the sky?
It's how I hear it. The display's just a little something I programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight.
It's beautiful.
You've only searched -- what is it, sixteen hundred stars without a peep? Try not to take it too personally.
Okay, let's just slow down. Pull up the starfield signal origin.
Can't we get rid of them?
I think we just hit the cosmic jackpot.
I'll come right to the point, Doctor. Your sending this message all over the world may well be a breach of National Security.
This isn't a person to person call, Mr. Kitz. I don't really think the civilization sending the message intended it just for Americans.
I'm saying you might have consulted us; the contents of this message could be extremely sensitive...
-- which we'll also need the network's help to receive and decode!
Colonel Jarrod, I'd like a twenty mile radio-silent perimeter put around this installation immediately.
And a hundred mile airspace.
Pardon me, but you can't do -- !
If at some later date the message proves harmless, we can discuss sharing it with the rest of the world, but until then --
... I don't understand it. All I can think is that maybe because the video gear wasn't accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design.
Is that your official response?
There is no direct evidence, no.
And current theory holds that to sustain the sort of wormholes you're talking about, even for a fraction of a second, would require more energy than our sun produces in a year, is that correct?
I don't have the figures in front of me, but yes, that sounds about right.
In fact, by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible.
Please answer the question, Doctor.
Is it possible. Yes. But --
Thank you, Doctor. Now --
So why don't you admit what by your own standards must be the truth: that this experience simply didn't happen.
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
I can't move any smaller.
Talk to him.
But what do I say?
Could we hear to China?
On that old shortwave? Maybe on a clear night. Come on now, under the covers.
Could we hear to the moon?
Big enough radio, I don't see why not.
Could we hear God?
Mmm, that's a good one. Maybe his echo... Okay, no more stalling.
Pensacola.
Time to sleep now, Captain. But you can ask more questions in the morning, okay?
I used... I used to dream you were alive... and then I'd wake up and lose you all over again.
I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
You're not real. None of this is.
That's my scientist.
So. Are you an hallucination? Or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin?
Am I artifact or dream? You might ask that about anything.
But you're so... I mean how could you possibly...? When I was unconscious. You... downloaded... my thoughts, my memories, even... This beach. I've never been here but I remember... it's how I always imagined... Pensacola.
So who -- what -- are you?
Originally just another species like yourselves. Well, not like you at all actually, but...
Can you show me?
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
Why did you contact us?
You contacted us. We were simply listening. We've been listening for millions of years.
And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?
Many others.
And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
Oh, we didn't build it. The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers.
So who...?
We don't know. Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.
The scale... it's just... So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?
Not all. Some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams. Some never make it this far.
So we passed some kind of test?
... life is unspeakably rare. So whenever we do find another civilization, especially one that's... struggling... We send a message. Sometimes we can offer help. Sometimes we can't. But we always try. Life is simply too precious not to.
Am I one... or many?
... all those voices... you gather them all together. Millions of intelligences in one consciousness... and now we're a part of it.
You always have been. We're all descendants of the same stars, Ellie. All made of the same primordial atoms.
So. What happens now?
Now... you go home.
No! I mean... why so soon?
If we don't engineer a consistent causality it'll work itself out on its own, and that's almost always worse. Ellie, according to your physics none of this is possible. A lot of it you're simply not capable of understanding, not yet. No offense.
Eventually you'll get here on your own. This was just the first step; in time you'll take another.
But -- other people from our planet should see what I've seen -- they should witness this for themselves.
That isn't the way it works.
But you said you wanted to help -- don't you see what it would mean?
No more stalling, Captain.
Please -- if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have -- it could make the difference --
It's time to go home now.
No. Please.
S.R. Hadden... You compromised our security codes.
You live here.
I find it convenient to keep my interests... mobile. Anyway, I've had my fill of life on the ground. After spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer -- after outliving three wives and two children... I find I've had quite enough of planet Earth.
Why am I here, Mr. Hadden?
The infamous, unfashionable bluntness. You're here so we can do business. I want to make a deal.
What kind of deal?
The powers that be have been quite busy lately, falling over each other to position themselves for the game of the century, if not the millennium. Perhaps you've noticed. Perhaps I could help deal you back in.
I didn't realize I was out.
Oh, maybe not out -- but definitely looking for you coat. I understand you've had some difficulty locating the -- what are you calling it? The 'primer' that will make decryption possible... I've found it.
You've... found it. What could I possibly have that you would want, Mr. Hadden?
I've had a long time to make enemies, Dr. Arroway. There are many governments, business interests, even religious leaders who would like to see me disappear. And I will grant them their wish soon enough... But before I do, I wish to make a small contribution -- a final gesture of goodwill toward the people of this little planet who've given -- from whom
If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you.
Page after page of data -- over sixty-three thousand in all, if I'm not mistaken... and at the end of each...
A page-break signal. A period.
Not if you think like a Vegan.
You're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --
Some kind of circuitry...?
Very good, Doctor. I've also detected structural elements, back references, a general movement from the simple to the complex -- all of which would seem to indicate instructions -- an enormously complicated set of instructions -- for building something.
A machine. But a machine that does what?
That would seem to be the question of the hour. I want to build it, Doctor. Of course I'm already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption -- but as I said, my colorful past has made many of those channels... difficult to navigate. I need someone on the inside.
And in return?
Mr. Hadden, I'm a scientist; I don't make deals... But. If you wish to give me, in good faith, access to your information, I can assure you that I will exert all reasonable efforts to promote your cause wherever it doesn't conflict with the best interests of science... or my better judgment.
A sunrise and a sunset every forty- five minutes.
It's so... small.
What's that?
It looks like pixie dust... Kent would've given anything to see this. David, too.
Yes. A shame. Still... it'd be worse if they died for nothing.
What are you talking about? It's over.
Oh, not quite yet. At least for their sake... ... I hope it's not. Because they're running out of time.
You sound like Joseph. You think the world ends with the millennium?
I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.
The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
Hokkaido Island.
The systems integration site.
As each component was tested and shipped off to Texas a duplicate was maintained and assembled in Hokkaido -- for backup purposes, of course. We've been right behind you the entire time. You see my problem: I couldn't appear to control too large a percentage; my enemies wouldn't stand for it. So I simply made sure the Japanese consortium received the systems integration contract.
Why don't you come back with me?
Very well. Assume this is true. Assume they have only the best of intentions. Suppose they decide to just step in and solve all our problems for us. You have no objection to them so flagrantly intervening in human affairs?
I'd say this is slightly different.
Perhaps. But on the off-chance that it is a 'doomsday device' of some kind, I plan to be very far away from your lovely Texas when it is activated.
I thought you were here because you want to go.
I do. More than anything. But I am also a realist. Soon this... what is your charming term -- ? Dog and pony show will finally be over, and I will go home.
You're implying that the whole selection process is a sham?
... Drumlin said you're been down at Arecibo for the last year.
It's beautiful but it does get a little lonely. Sometimes I think the reason we build these things in such godforsaken places isn't to avoid excess radio traffic but because we're all such pathetic antisocial misfits... Speaking of which: How're you getting on with the old man?
He's an incredible prick but I never learned so much in my life.
Ellie. Arroway.
Peter Valerian.
Sounds like a Russian general.
I read your paper on ETI's. It's brilliant.
Keep it down, okay? Drumlin thinks I'm enough of a flake as it is. Look -- everyone here has their little fetishes. Caven goes to topless bars, Vernon's got his carnivorous plants... mine just happens to be extraterrestrial intelligence.
... I'm just so sick of feeling defensive about the things I care about! Or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like Drumlin, when if they'd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts...
They can't. I think it's against human nature to admit to that level of... insignificance; to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe.
It's like the pre-Copernicans who swore the sun revolved around the Earth, or the Victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made. I mean... try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us -- then imagine trying to explain... I dunno, a microwave oven -- to someone even a hundred years ago --
'Any sufficiently advanced technology...'
... I keep telling myself okay, that's just the price, you have to do your time doing shitwork before you're allowed to get to the good stuff... but if I have to catalog one more quasar... God, I've missed you.
Any luck on the grant money?
Please. Any chance of that died the day David Drumlin was appointed head of the N.S.F. I have been in contact with a few other SETI people; we've been trying to find backing from private investors. I've even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there...
And?
... We've been going after some of the big multi-nationals but without much luck; got a donation from a New York dowager... We've even been thinking about selling T-shirts.
If we lived at any previous time in human history we wouldn't even have the option of failing -- we'd have to wonder our whole lives, unable to do anything about it. This time, right now, is unique in our history, in any civilization's history -- the moment of the acquisition of technology. The moment when contact becomes possible. We've already beaten incredible odds
How close are you to getting this funding put together?
It's almost there. The hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time.
What if I said I could get Drumlin to agree to sell you time in New Mexico?
The V.L.A.?
Thirty-one linked dishes. You could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here.
Peter -- if you can get him to do that for me he'd obviously do the same for you -- we could -- !
Actually --
We could be together again --
-- I'm moving to Washington.
Greenbank?
I'm going on staff at the N.S.F. To work for Drumlin.
But what about your research -- ?
This is a chance to be of enormous help to other people's research -- to have the power to be a real advocate where David's got blind spots --
But the work --
'The work,' Jesus, Ellie, can't there just once be more to life than the work? Okay, maybe that's the only way to get the recognition, win the prizes --
Please, you're just as ambitious as I am, more --
Maybe that's the problem. I want... a family, Ellie. I want kids. A townhouse on L street instead of still living like a college kid. A real life. Maybe that makes me a sellout but I don't care anymore. It's what I want.
And you think I don't want those things? You think I don't stay up half the night wondering if I've made the right choice living half a world away from you, wondering if any of this is worth what I'm giving up for it everyday? Let's get married.
Jesus --
Right now -- we'll drive down to Ramey and get the base chaplain to marry us.
Ellie --
I'm serious about this, Peter --
Ellie -- I'm getting married. Her name's Laura. She came up to Owens Valley to do her post-doc about six months after you left.
You sonofabitch.
Ellie.
It's good to see you, Ellie.
Someone tell me this is really happening.
It's really happening.
That you, Valerian?
Like it or not.
Ellie -- are you okay?
I'm -- I'm fine.
Thank God. When we lost contact, I thought -- we thought... but you're okay. We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction. Did you notice anything at all that --
Wait -- hold on a minute --
It's all right, the important thing is you're safe --
Peter, what are you talking about? What malfunction? What day is this?
What day?
Peter... What is going on? Has everyone gone completely insane?
That's one way of putting it. Kitz, the President, the I.S.C. have shut down all official communications; there've also been reports of riots flaring up across the U.S. and Europe. Until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough, especially for you --
I agree with Mr. Rank that there are unavoidable religious implications here -- but I don't think it justifies taking an alarmist position. Dr. Arroway is right -- their chosen means of communication was a scientific one, and a scientific approach is probably appropriate, at least until the theological dimensions of the problem become more apparent.
And where exactly does that put your position...?
Champagne please.
... What I'm curious about are the wilderness years. You're out there all alone, no money, mocked by the skeptics. It must have taken tremendous faith.
I'd say logic more than faith. The odds were on my side.
And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
Spoken like a true believer.
What about you? Doesn't all of this shake your faith at all?
How do you mean?
Well it's been a while, but I don't recall the Bible saying too much about alien civilizations.
'My father's house has many mansions.'
Your 'faith' tells you that the distance a pendulum swings from the vertical can never get bigger, only smaller.
And you believe this law with all your heart and soul.
And mind, yes. What are you --
I flinched.
Only a tiny bit. Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt.
That's not doubt. That's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct. I always wondered what you religious types did with your free time.
... It's an old story. I grew up in South Boston, more or less on the streets. By the time I was thirteen I'd tried my first hit of heroin, by fifteen I'd stopped using but I was dealing full-time. By the time I was nineteen I decided I didn't want to live any more, at least not in a world like that. One
Can you try?
I had... an experience. Of belonging. Of unconditional love. And for the first time in my life I wasn't terrified, and I wasn't alone.
And there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?
Look, I'm a reasonable person, and reasonably intelligent. But this experience went beyond both. For the first time I had to consider the possibility that intellect, as wonderful as it is, is not the only way of comprehending the universe. That it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with.
You may not believe this... but there's a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your God. To believe that we're all here for a purpose, that all this... means something. But it's because that part of me wants it so badly that I'm so stubborn about making sure it isn't just self-delusion. Of course I want to know God
Do you love your parents?
I never knew my mother. My father died when I was nine.
Did you love him?
Yes. Very much.
So. Is this kosher fraternizing with the enemy like this?
Some of my best friends are scientists.
I was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors.
Some of my best friends are scientists. They're saying the machine is alive.
Not exactly. It has organic qualities, but we don't really understand how they're integrated with the mechanical systems.
Maybe you're creating a monster.
I don't think so.
Why?
It's too... elegant. The degree of economy is extraordinary; it's really the next logical step... Even on Earth technology has always aspired to a condition of nature. D.N.A. outclasses any computer we can come up with; the human body is the most exquisitely designed machine imaginable.
In other words, God is one hell of an engineer.
Relativity. Explain this to me one more time... even if you traveled near the speed of light, when you came back --
If you came back.
If you came back... you'd only be four years older -- but over 50 years would have passed on Earth.
Something like that.
If you came back. If you survived at all. Which it's pretty certain you wouldn't.
You're willing to die for this.
I read your book.
Really.
Losing Faith: The Search For Meaning In the Age of Reason. Catchy.
What'd you think?
I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President.
I won't deny I was ambitious. When I had my... experience... I wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible. I'm the first to admit that process included making some compromises. You didn't answer my question.
I thought it was well-written. Heart-felt. And a little bit naive... But that's just the enemy's perspective.
I don't consider you the enemy, Ellie. I'm not 'out to get' technology. I only ask the question: Does it have to have all the answers? I look out there and I see so much emptiness... People are so starved for meaning, and it's something they just don't seem to be getting from science.
Did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn't science's fault, but meaning's?
I don't follow.
Do you really believe your life is meaningless?
I don't know. But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility.
And yet you're willing to die for this cause, the one thing that's given your life a sense of purpose. Don't you see the contradiction here -- ?
It's getting late...
Ellie --
... Another question I would ask would be a very simple one. How did you do it? How did you evolve as far as you have and not destroy yourselves?
An excellent question, Doctor. But what if we don't like the answer?
How do you mean?
Ellie... the last time we spoke... I said some things...
So. The final countdown.
The final countdown.
During the crusades -- pilgrims who made the journey to the holy land brought back a palm frond to show they'd actually been there. I thought it sort of made sense that Earth is now your holy land, so...
You're trembling.
I do seem to be... Maybe because I'm just a little bit terrified about tomorrow.
What...?
I'm sorry.
Ellie, what is it?
I'm sorry -- I can't --
What?
I can't do this --
What are you so afraid of?
Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now --
What are my other options? In fifty years? Never?
Please --
I'm in love with you, Ellie.
Don't you understand? I just have to hold it together -- just until tomorrow --
And then what? Then you'll be safe?
-- I don't know --
Do you really think your life is meaningless, Eleanor? Is that why you're so quick to risk it -- because if your life means nothing then you have nothing to lose?
I can't hear this now --
Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm assuming you read my deposition.
It was quite a page turner.
So. I'm assuming they sent you here to administer last rites?
I'm not sure it's come to that.
They don't believe me.
I do.
You're sure you want to? In the universe I saw we're not exactly the stars of the show. What happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small.
It also makes God enormous. I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away. As it will everyone else's.
I don't have any proof, Palmer.
Ellie, you're the proof. You tell them your story. Ultimately they'll have no choice but to believe you.
It's not enough, don't you understand? I know it happened -- but by every standard of science, by every standard I've lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point. It may be true but it doesn't matter because I can't prove it's real.
Ellie, the only one holding you to that standard is you! The people want to hear your story, they need to hear it!
But --
Have you seen what's happening out there? The terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie. People need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them!
I want to, Palmer -- more than anything. But it has to be real. It has to be true.
... but it is a good question, and I suppose I'll always wonder about the answer: Why would they send me back without proof?
Maybe what you experienced can't be reduced to images on a videotape. Maybe they still plan to grant your request, only in their own way, in their own time... Or maybe it's just like you said: ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
In other words, God works in mysterious ways...
I don't know. If it was a god, it was searching for a greater one. It was still searching for meaning...
Does that mean you think it doesn't exist?
I'm not sure... Maybe it simply exists in the search for it. Maybe its something we have to make for ourselves.
Meaning...
You have a question, Dr. Arroway?
I question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile.
It's designed purely as a defensive device. Call it a reasonable precaution.
Call it xenophobic paranoia. Don't you see the absolute absurdity of this? This isn't about them, it's about us -- our violence, our fear and mistrust --
Dr. Arroway, you are entitled to your opinion. But we feel quite strongly that it would by both irresponsible and naive to send a human being into a completely unknown, completely uncontrollable situation absolutely defenseless.
You kill me, you really do. The first truly global, a-political event in history and you can't wait to spin it.
How would you propose we handle it, Doctor?
I guess I'd say I trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of, thanks for the advice, but no thanks. But to dilute or censor the truth, for whatever reason --
Nobody is proposing we censor the truth here, Doctor. We're simply talking about putting a mechanism in place --
Oh my God...
Well. That would seem to decide it. Like it or not, for the moment, anyway, it looks like we're all in this together.
But --
... as have all attempts at internal analysis. We've tried sonargrams, magnetic resonance, gamma rays; it's completely impenetrable.
Recommendations?
I don't know. Maybe we built the damn thing wrong. Maybe it was all a hoax... The safest thing would probably be to do a Chernobyl; encase it in concrete.
Boss, I made an arrangement with that man to take his broom.
Git your shovel and git to work.
I don't think you understand. We made a deal ---
Git movin', I said.
But I made this arrangement --
You don't take another man's place, boy.
I'm lucky I got a broom. Work up top. Real easy job. Man, it's gonna be hot down in that ditch.
Fifty cents? Sweet job like that worth at least a buck.
I'll make it a dollar.
Buck is a deal.
Hot damn, Drag. Tomorrow's Saturday. Another week almost made.
How'd you find me?
Helen, she sent along your things with a note, and John here, he wrote to the police.
Well, Arletta, I got to stand down here.
I allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with.
Like to oblige you, Arletta, but right off I don't know where to put my hands on 'em.
Sometimes I wisht people was like dogs, Luke. Comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just don't recognize her pups no more, so she don't have no hopes nor love to bring her pain. She just don't give a damn. They let you smoke?
Yeah, well, Arletta, you done your best. What I done with myself is my problem.
No it hain't, Luke. You ain't alone. Ever whar you go, I'm with you, and so's John.
You never thought that's a heavy load?
No. But things ain't always like they seem, Arletta. You know that. A man's gotta go his own way.
Yeah.
What are you doin' here?
We call it abuildin' time, Arletta.
You never wanted to live forever anyways, did you? It wasn't such a hell of a life.
Oh, I had me some high old times. Yore old man, Luke, wasn't much for stickin' around, but damn it he made me laugh.
You think life is some kind of ocean voyage and you start out with buntin' and hollerin' and high hopes, but the damn ship goes down before you ever reach the other side. Luke?
Here, Mom.
What went wrong?
Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.
No.
You allus had good jobs, and that girl in Kentucky I taken a shine to her.
She took off with that convertible feller...
Well, why not? Idee of marryin' got you all choked up, trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin' the hell out of all of us.
Yeah.
I'm leavin' the place to John.
That's good: he earned it.
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
Gotta go, Arletta.
Lookit her bounce.
Gotta have kings.
Go hard!
Tell us about it.
A salesman! Cool Hand Luke a salesman?
We saw the broads.
Comin' out here, Boss?
You was eyeballin', Luke. You can't gitcha mind on them weeds if yer eyeballin'...
Then how come it ain't done yet?
I don't know, Boss.
What's all this dirt in the yard?
Please! Please!
Git to work!
You got your mind right, Luke?
Yes, Boss. I got it right.
Supposin' you was to backslide on us, Luke? Supposin' you was to backsass or try to run again...
Luke, you run again and we'll kill you.
Go git it, Luke.
You cut that up fer lunch, Luke.
He ain't even got the sense to run from the road like everybody else.
Captain says to wait 'til the Patrol gits here.
She's on to him. You shoulda waited fer me to git her out -- loose like she is, he kin run her crazy.
It ain't my fault you don't know how to handle your dogs.
Here's the Patrol.
Here, Captain.
Maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence. What was that?
Cuttin' the heads off parkin' meters, Captain.
Well, we ain't never had one of them. Where'd you think that was gonna get you?
I guess you could say I wasn't thinkin', Captain.
Says here you done real good in the war: Silver Star, Bronze Star, couple Purple Hearts. Sergeant! Little time in stockades. Come out the same way you went in: Buck Private.
That's right, Captain. Just passin' the time.
You gonna get used to wearing them chains aftera while, Luke. But don't you never stop listenin' to them clinkin'. That's gonna remind you of what I been sayin'.
In the Navy, we used to call guys --
You was to sell your job, maybe this Lucas War Hero would give you a price.
Had it done in Singapore. Bunch of us drunk as coots --
Hey, Tattoo!
Only two? Man, I already done eight. Nothin' to it. Just make the days and let the weeks and the years make themselves.
That ain't nuthing compared to what we used to do in San Pedro. There was this ensign...
You can't do that!
Borrowin' or payin' back?
Borrowin'.
You gotta mind your manners, you actin' like a hillbilly tramp.
Newmeat looks like a poker player, Drag.
She looks just like Mrs. Patricia Handy, a married woman... I useta fool with. Man, I kin sniff blondes from a hunnert yards and redheads from a mile and a half.
Oh, man, did you see her? Did you see her?
I'm dyin'. I'm dyin'!
Whatcha got?
Pair'a nines.
Uh-huh. And he ain't got nothing showing. Raise his head off.
He's been betting his head from the gun. Gotta have kings.
So then you just call him.
But there's still daylight left.
Jus' take it slow, buddy.
What happened? How far did you get?
He ain't eating beans fer lunch.
Looka that! Two of them. Oh my...
Lemme see it!
Oh lookit that brunette.
Dragline, lemme look at the picture.
Come on, Drag. Lemme take a look.
A cold drink.
A cold drink? You mean one cold drink? To feast yore starvin' fishy l'il eyes on The Picture? A true vision of Paradise itself? With two of the angels right there in plain sight a- friskin' round with mah boy?
A cold drink? Okay?
That's my baby.
Somebody say somethin'?
I didn't say nothin', Boss.
Well, whatta we got here?
Oh we got our sources... Tearing the heads off... what was it... gumball machines? What kind of thing is that for a grown man?
Whatta you so happy about?
Plumb busted out. Looks like the hard road finally got to Mister Lucas War Hero.
Course not. He ain't in the box 'cause a the joke played on him. He's there 'cause he back sassed a Free Man. They got their rules and we ain't got nothing to do with that. Woulda probably happened to him sooner or later, to a complainer like him. He's gotta learn the rules same as anybody else.
Yeah, those poor old guards need all the help they can get.
Slow down, man. They ain't passing out medals for slinging dirt.
Man, this here Newmeat parking meter bandit thing what calls itself Luke don't know nuthin' 'bout nuthin'.
Maybe he's been chain-ganging too long.
Lucille? Where do you get that?
That'sa Lucille, you mullet head! Any girl so innocent and built like that gotta be named Lucille.
Shut your mouth 'bout my Lucille.
Your Lucille? Man, you better put them glasses back on and take a look at yourself.
Whatta you mean, forget it?
I'm gonna kill you, you go on...
Nuthin'! A handfull of nuthin'! You stupid mullet-head. He beat you with nuthin'! Just like today when he kept coming back at me.
Nuthin' can be a pretty cool hand.
Hey, buddy. Take it easy. You're making me look bad.
They don't know iff'n to smile, spit or swallow.
Where'd the road go?
Why'd you have to say fifty? Why not thirty-five or thirty-nine?
Fifty's a nice round number.
Damn, Luke. What's the matter with you? what's the matter with me?
What did I do? Stole and tole lies. I loved mah neighbor and his wife, but what did I do to deserve this lunatic to come in mah happy home and beat me outa hard earned bread.
We got it locked in the sock.
Yeah, I know. But what we gotta do first is stretch that l'il ol' belly of yours -- git it all strained out, in fightin' shape, like a barrage balloon.
You ol' sack of guts. I had a belly like yours, we wouldn't have nothin' to worry about.
'Atsa sign I got me an affectionate nature.
Like an elephant.
Look at Him go. Bam! Bam!
Sure do... that's why we didn't bet with the Navy.
Don't hit me no more, Boss! Don't hit me! I'll do anythin' you say but just don't hit me! Oh Luke. You are an original, you truly are. You really fooled them.
Foolin', Hell! I would have eaten that dirt for them. They coulda used my head for a shovel and a my face for a broom... They just never did get a piece of my mind.
Whoee, it's cold. Wisht I had somethin' to eat. Bread, grits, beans even. Soon's we get to my house, we're gonna have us one big meal and then I'm gonna show you some farm girls that...
We ain't goin' nowhere.
What you talkin' about, Luke? We're together, you and me, just like always. Now the thing we gotta work out is how to get Koko outa there and then the Terrible Trio be all complete again. Man, this old Free World ain't gonna know which ear to stand on.
Yeah, well, you and Koko kin handle it without me.
What you mean, Luke?
But, Luke...
Take it easy, Drag.
Luke. Where you goin?
On my own.
Is that your answer, Old Man? You're a hardcase too, ain't you?
Luke, are you alright?... They got us, boy. They're out there thicker'n flies. Bosses and dogs and sheriffs and more guns than I ever seen in my life. We don't have a chance, Luke... They caught up with me right after we split up and they was aimin' to kill you, Luke. But I got 'em to promise if you give up peaceful, they
Do we even get our same bunks back?
Why sure, Luke. I mean I didn't talk to them about that. But why not? They're reasonable, Luke. Hell, we only been gone a coupla hours.
You don't understand a thing, do you, Drag?
Luke, you got to listen to me. All you got to do is just give up nice and quiet, just play it cool.
Like I always do?
Dragline gives out the names here. You'll get yours when he figures you out.
Not a liar. You just have a common -- and likable -- tendency toward exaggeration.
Nobody kin eat fifty eggs.
You just said he could eat anything.
Koko, write down their names, don't just make marks.
One rule! No throwing up. He throws up, you forfeit everything.
He peels the eggs himself. That's understood.
Thirty-nine... forty... forty-one... forty-two...
All right now: get mad at them eggs. Eat it there boy! Bite it! Gnaw on it!
What's the writing say?
Dear Boys. Playing it cool. Wish you were here. Love, Cool Hand Luke.
That ole box collapse and fall apart before Luke calls quits.
Oh Lord!
That fool. That damn fool.
A bunch. Must be halfa dozen Newmeat.
No more than five. For a cold drink.
Man! It's gonna be one hot muther today.
Man, it's so hot.
Ana paira ninas. Koko's the brains.
I'm in.
Ace calls. Here we go. King-five gets a tray for no help. Paira ninas gets a Jack. Ana man with the ace gets... slop in the face... Ninas up.
Cuter again.
I gotta believe. Out! Now they're rollin'. King-five-four gets an eight. Pair'a nines with a Jack gets a four. Ninas still up.
Man, you play like a kokonut. You got to call him at least.
Oh no, man! Not on this hot muther.
Man Oh Man.
Kick a buck.
Back a buck.
Yeah, found one in this supermarket, keys in the ignition.
Well, how far didya get?
Picture's a phoney... Cost me a week's pay.
But -- but --
Koko, why don't you let one of these Newmeats take your broom for today?
You can't switch 'round jobs, anyway. I figured he knew that.
You think you've been working hard. This muther'll break your back.
One, two, three...
Stop that.
How about you tryin' to make me?
He'll never make it.
What are you talking about?
He doesn't know when to give in. They'll kill him.
I don't see no sign of guts in you.
No. No chains either.
You ain't man enough to wear them!
But you're dog enough. Maybe they'll let you sleep outside the box near your master.
Big deal paper hanger! Hell, anyone who can write can pass fifty-sixty dollar checks. Like breakin' open a piggy bank.
You've been having bad luck with masters, haven't you? Your last one left you when the cops came... and now Luke. You should complain to the S.P.C.A.
Excuse me, but would you mind explaining why you're watching the lady upstairs?
I hate this...
Now look what you did.
What did I do?
You threatened to drive her downtown. She has agoraphobia.
Fear of what...
It's good medicine.
Where were you? Don't tell me. It's just under seventy, right? The sun is strong but the air is dry and fresh...
I got it myself... I couldn't wait.
I've told you: I can't afford to garage it.
Are you kidding? You buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which <u>rots</u>... to garage a fleet of stretch limos.
I had the dream again. And I got another call. This time he spoke. He said "You and me, you and me."
A little heavy breathing is what most of us yearn for. <u>Forget</u> it.
He can't phone you unless the warden gets an okay from you. Did you give him an approval?
Oh God. I'm really crazy.
When was the last time you washed your hair?
Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?
Cellulite. What do you say I blindfold you and take you to the gym. Aerobics with housewives...
You parked right behind him. The one I noticed earlier. I didn't say anything, I thought he'd leave. Just take a look.
Oh my God! Help! HE'S READING A NEWSPAPER!
But earlier, he was staring up here. <u>Please</u>, Andy.
Oh, God. I must have looked horrible.
No, dear. You're at your best with a bag in front of your face.
I want to die.
What? What'd I do?
Reminded me that I used to be attractive. That men used to want me...
When are you going to call them?
I can't, Andy.
None of you know anything about it. Now go. And Andy, if you persist in playing doctor, leave, with them.
I'm the only friend you've got, darling, and I don't intend to stop doing what I think is good for us.
The moon is up, my night to howl. Will you be okay?
Oh, God, I forget. Yes. Yes. You go. Poor thing, you ought to get out.
You're fired.
Sorry, Luv. I've got a date.
It's almost six. And guess what? Hall likes me bathed and shaved.
You bastard!
Where have you <u>been</u>? What happened to your wallet?
Investigators Halloran and Goetz. I apologize for Goetz, he's a firehouse dog.
Are you staying long? Shall I shut the door? Make your coffee? Make the beds?
We'll get the paramedics...
Tell her we're sorry we bothered her.
She just got to sleep. Do you have to tell her about it now?
Tell her about <u>what</u>?
Yes. Without question.
Without question? He only scored 40 percent, four out of ten criteria? Couldn't another expert say he <u>flunked</u> the sexual sadist test? What curve are you marking on, Doctor?
The test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects.
Only part. What else? What did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because Joan of Arc told him to do it.
He was lying.
'Lying. He was lying.' I asked you what you thought, not what he did.
I thought he was lying.
You said, first, he was lying. How do you know that, Doctor?
He took pains to hide his actions because he knew they were morally wrong. He was not acting on mad impulse. He was sane and acting out a pattern he carefully followed every time.
What pattern was that?
The first two murders.
What first two murders. We don't know about them here, do we?
He told me he had done two others just like it.
When was that?
When he was seventeen.
And you believed him when he told you he had done that.
Who are you?
Inspector Halloran. Homicide. You were supposed to contact a Peter Kurten?
I was? How you spell that?
Cut the crap. You got a sheet the length of my arm...
I never hurt nobody...
Shut up -- I'm talking. You got felony breaking and entering, burglary, felonious...
You don't listen very good. This break in -- I can call it a felony -- three strikes, and you got about sixteen strikes already, and you're in jail for the rest of your life, no parole. Or I could see it gets forgotten.
You get me out first.
Tell me what you want me to say. Anything.
You were going to make a delivery to Peter Kurten for Daryll Lee Cullum. I want Kurten's phone number.
Wait... wait... I already called him, I threw it away.
You already made the delivery?
No, that's still in my jacket I was wearing. We were supposed to meet on the docks, that number 47 wharf, 10 o'clock Friday. He's gonna hand me 500 bucks.
What Friday?
Then you get your ass outta here, I don't wanta see you again...
I brought a present for the lady, there. I'm looking for her, to give her the present...
You break into her apartment to deliver a gift? Where is it?
The door was open, swear to God, I'm just looking for her when you come charging up the stairs...
Where is it?
Daryll Lee Cullum, he wrote that book, he wanted the lady to have it. They won't let him send it to her, so I'm getting out, he asks me to deliver it in person, he says, put it on her pillow. It has all about how he tried to kill her.
He told you she was loaded, any- thing you could steal you could keep, Conrad? You bought yourself a return ticket to Quentin, breaking and entering.
The door was already open...
We know... Send the book to evidence...
She's supposed to have it.
Hello, Daryll Lee.
You read my book which as you know, hit the stands a couple of weeks ago. You read it yet.
What book?
I'll look for it, Daryll Lee.
Bet you never figured I'd follow in your footsteps. It's real well- written. You should read it -- you're in it.
I will. I'll call you, Daryll, and talk to you about it after I've read it. Right now I have a question... Peter Kurten.
Kurten! Is he bothering you? I told that son I'd send him what he wanted if he leave you alone.
Ah ha. What did he want?
Something personal. Is he bothering you?
I don't know. I'd like to know where he is.
Listen, you want my advice? Steer clear. He's writing me he's gonna finish 'my unfinished symphony.' He's gonna give me $550 for some of my cum, he says he's in a position to see that I will be immortal if he has some of my spunk. I'm offended. Right away I smell <u>freak</u>. Writin' about him and me and <u>you</u> bein' joined and he's
I think whatever is best for you, Daryll. And maybe you're right, that's the place.
You come and visit.
Where did you send the message to Peter Kurten?
How was Conrad supposed to find Kurten?
Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
In jail.
Hi. It's your worst student, Peter Foley -- how do you grade me now, Doctor?
Who was the man in the basement?
You like that action? Didn't that cop on TV look <u>solemn</u>? The guy in the basement doesn't matter, anyway, just another lonely heart.
Where are you, Peter?
What was that? What am I hearing? The sound of an epiphany, a sudden blinding insight?
It's Daryll Lee Cullum, isn't it?
Mm-hmm. I can't get to you. You have to come to me.
You know I can't do that.
For God's sake Peter, leave her out of it. You don't want her, you want me.
I need her; she's a cop. I have to kill a cop, and then...
You've been perfect. Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
Yes. I do. I want it to end now. Let her go. I'll come -- just let her go. She's not important.
You know where.
Kill me, Peter, do it, now.
No. Not yet.
Do it. If that's what all this carnage is about, then do it. Have enough guts to do it.
We'll keep talking. Until they get here. Then...
I have no life anymore. I ruined your life, make me pay for it.
Why did you do that? Didn't you have any idea how hard it was for me, to get that far? I worshipped you. You inspired me. I thought you could understand me the way you understood the others. I knew that about you -- the ones you admired were the great murderers; they fascinated you.
That's not who I admire -- I admire people who are good at what they do, great artists, writers, thinkers...
Oh, please. I know what's coming, now. "Let me help you..."
Do anything you want to me. I give myself to you. Only put the knife down. Isn't this what you always wanted? I know it's what we all want, to love and to loved. I could love you. You could work together in some safe place, learn to really understand you, help you, give you some peace of mind, some happiness...
Who is this?
No, ma'am. This is no joke. And neither is tying up telephone lines to police with crank calls while people in trouble are trying to get through for help.
You're calling me a crank?
Do you have any evidence to report, ma'am? Do you know any of the victims...
I think this is number three...
Ring the gong, he goes. Poor impulse control.
Is he out?
Who?
If he's not out, why are they here?
Because of your phone calls.
I want to tell you it's a great honor to meet you and talk to you.
You don't admire me. No police admire me. I got one of you killed. Why don't you say right out what you're here for?
<u>You</u> called <u>us</u>, Doctor Hudson.
Sugar and cream for Goetz; I take mine black. You're absolutely correct. The politicians don't want panic headlines spoiling the Festival of Love.
Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.
Would you want to work with us on this?
Oh, my God, no! I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary. I never leave this apartment now. Nobody ever comes here. I just wanted to get your attention. I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.
I think you are. I really admire everything you've done; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours.
Inspector Halloran, that is so much bullshit, you don't like or admire me, but the beautiful part is I don't give a fuck. That's the upside of having a breakdown.
Well, it's a hell of an apartment you got here. I'm living one step away from the projects, myself, but I get to go to work every day, wading in blood and guts. I guess the books you wrote about these sons of bitches paid off pretty good.
Will you go. Andy, make them go.
Is it an ongoing case?
For months... last October.
It was a lover or a husband. Someone close. Somebody who knew her and cared about her.
How do you know that?
The bodies have been carefully arranged... different positions, but somehow the same. The positions are brutal... yet quite... artful. It's like... a signature. He's proud of his accomplishments. There are early Picassos and late Picassos, but you always recognize the hand. He wants us to recognize <u>his</u> hand. I've seen this hand before... what are you hiding?
Nothing.
Where are the stockings he strangled them with?
How did you know they were stockings?
Why imitate a dead serial killer?
If you knew why, you might know where to look for him. I don't envy you this; he's not done -- he's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush. Now, I've done what you asked me.
How do you know that?
Can you make a copy we can show on our computers?
I'm going to put a guard on your door.
One officer already got killed trying to protect me. Please, just take it all away. Leave me alone.
We'll show that to...
I am not going to look at any more pictures. They're like a disease. They get into my head. I can't get them out.
I don't look at pictures. I look at the <u>real thing</u>. I don't feel infected.
Maybe that's why you can't catch him. I <u>know</u> what she looks like -- the red-headed woman in my computer.
She probably let him in the door without a thought. Where are their mothers?! Where are the mothers that are supposed to teach them to be wary and to tough and not afraid to fight?
It's <u>anybody</u> connected to author- ity. They write, they even knock on your door. They're <u>fans</u>. It thrills them to flirt with getting caught.
Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in <u>your</u> computer?
That's amazing. A whole new book, thought up in a minute. Very good. All I know how t do is get up, take a shower, and go to work. Hope, if he does another I'll nail the son of bitch, and they'll spell my name right in the newspaper. Where is Andy going?
He's going home. He slept over because I was a little anxious...
We've got another one.
That's no surprise.
But it's a different m.o.
Then what do you need me for?
She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says "no dumping." Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose. It's all different but it seems so -- the same. Artificial and <u>posed</u>... Something's wrong with it.
Who turned off the Internet computer...
I turned it off. It's like an open window he can climb right in...
He comes in the window, we maybe grab him. Where's the on-switch?
Have you got a warrant? Get the hell out o here! This is the <u>only space I have left in the</u> <u>world</u>! Why can't you leave me out of it?
Helen -- the killer directly contacted you. His interest in you is <u>intense</u>. I'm worried about you. I don't want to lose you. I know this stirs up every monster under the bed, but this is the only direct contact we have with him. The only chance we have to trap him. So, you can turn Internet back on, or I do, and we
That little Winona Ryder manner... you're more convincing as Clint Eastwood.
Ruben.
Hello, Ruben... So that's that...
There were needle marks. But no drugs in her blood.
Is that it?
That's not consistent... You said they never changed their style, they're robots...
Consistency is the hobgoblin of <u>little</u> minds. Tell them to test for the chemicals found in Windex. That's a product for cleaning with...
I know Windex, for God's sake, I clean my own windows...
It's what Bianchi and Buono injected into one of their victims.
Injected Windex! Why would he switch to a new m.o.?
Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half way to nailing him. Serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive. This guy has a plan all thought out, flexible and complex. He's playing a game with us. Who will he imitate next? Maybe he's doing all the serial killers in history, the great innovators, the murderers' hall of fame. Just to prove he's better
He'll get caught. If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...
Who's going to catch him? You? And if you do, there'll be another one. And one after that.
You're afraid of him.
This one, yes. I was always curious about these twisted little souls, but this is the first one I've felt personally terrified of. He's something new and unheard of. I don't know what he wants.
Halloran.
You betrayed me! Now every psychopath in the city knows I'm back in business... You lied to me!
I did not; the Mouth -- that's what we call Susan Schiffer -- got it on her own.
Why should I trust you?
Helen, hang up, let Ruben get on with his work...
What's that siren?
One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...
Ruben's gone to look... It's banged up but it looks like a .44. It's Son of Sam. Is it Son of Sam?
They put Merry <u>Saks</u> on it?!
He said to send you his regards and to tell you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem.
What I can't believe is that in an earlier life I slept with him! Christ! Any God that loved his people would give women a rewind on their life and an erase button. Just give me a minute here. The letter is addressed to me... You don't feel fear, do you? You're young. You feel like you'll live forever. How wonderful.
I put my ass on the line, giving you that.
They weren't going to show it to me?! The arrogance! It's my <u>life</u>!
It's also the major piece of evidence, and it makes you a key part of his plan. You can't run away from it anymore. Look at the order he's doing them... He did three as the Boston Strangler just to tell us a copycat serial killer was at work. Then he did one like the Hillside Strang- ler. And then one as Son of
'...great dark hall of fame... all our greatest killers...' His greatest <u>heroes</u>? He wants to be famous. When they're caught and people like me write about them, we give them a kind of immortality. They get thousands of letters. Ramirez kills eight women and gets a hundred marriage proposals a month. They're like film stars.
Let's speed up the game plan... call all the living serials to ask if they've had contact with a Peter Kurten. We could use some help on the phones...
They're not talking to me. Saks looks right through me. I ask him for some bodies, for the phones -- he's so encouraging: "you make that <u>your</u> little job." Condescending bastard. Helen, on your lists to call is San Quentin. Daryll Lee Cullum?
What happened to you?!
I just thought it was so -- unprofessional. Of you both!
He felt sorry for me. It was so nice to flirt. He was a darling man.
A man? I thought he was a boy. This last Christmas was the happiest Christmas I had in the last ten years... you know why? It was the first Christmas in six years I was not in love. Son of a bitch <u>married men</u>! Who cares about marriage, the bed just gets crowded and noisy?!
You're exhausted. Let me get you a brandy.
Who's the married man?
The University computer is down for maintenance, but I've been going through my own notes...
Yes. Dahmer! And after that...
Bundy. That's the last one in your speech...
Maybe you should...
I'm working on it! It's what I do. Quinn...Halloran. I'll wait. Where's Andy, can we get some coffee in here?
I am not going to talk about it. How do you <u>know</u> it was Andy if the head was gone? Where is the head? Are you looking for it? Oh, God, why him? Because of me. I can't talk about it. I write about things like this, stuff it all in books and bury it in libraries. This is the first person close to
How many do you need to sleep. Really sheep?
W-We had a fight. I called him... called him a name...
Helen. I saw him die. I saw him burning on the basement stairs, he never reached the top.
They never kill themselves. How do you know it was him. You never met him. You never even saw a photograph...
Helen -- let go. You've got to let go.
He hasn't done Bundy. He's done every one of the others, hasn't he? If there are three dead Chi Omega college girls tomorrow, how will you feel? Go there. See if there could be any way for him to escape.
This has been the worst 48 hours of my life. I'm going home. I'm going to try to get drunk.
If there's a one percent possibil- ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again?
Why can't I drive home? I will. You. Look at you. <u>You</u> need a ride home. And you don't even know it.
You were the one that talked about moonbikes and called me a crank? Oh God, I <u>am</u>! Make them some coffee. Halloran, is it? Investigator Goetz? I had a crank call myself-- he said... I thought it might be Daryll Lee Cullum. I thought he might be out of prison.
I don't want this. What are they?
Somebody is imitating his m.o. Look for a plumber or carpenter or handyman; that's how deSalvo got in the door and caught them off guard.
The Boston Strangler, when was that...?
That computer's wired into INTERNET.
He's hacked into her Internet address. He's a hacker.
It's a game they like to play. Berkowitz -- "Son of Sam" -- hung around the crime scene, talking to the cops. This one's probably watching <u>you</u>, laughing at you.
It's gone. The file's not here. What did you do?
I just started it copying to tape, but the tape never ran. It just did that...
I know 'Halloran.' What's the rest of it?
MaryJane. We call her M.J.
We're through for the night, aren't we? You go on. Get some sleep. I'll stay until we can get a man out here and maybe catch a cab home.
You and MaryJane aren't lovers.
Are you always so bold?
The problem for me is... you're in the witness category. Know what I mean?
Tell me what to do!
Don't let go... I can't breathe... I'll die!
The lock...
I'll get a locksmith.
It's a woman shot in a car?
Yes. I have to go...
Don't hang up!
<u>What</u>?...
Yes.
Is there a phone booth there?
They all have one...
Open the door. Please.
He was in my apartment!
You know how to use this?
They taught me at the FBI. I was very good at it. It scared me... I liked it.
You take it, hang on to it, it'll make you feel safer. Stay put.
Ma'am, please get out of your vehicle...
Merry, how... oh, Christ, of course, you had my phone tapped.
Just get out of your vehicle...
He's got Sergeant Halloran in there. He'll kill her the minute he sees or hears your people...
You've been very useful, Doctor, we appreciate all you've done, and now the professional will take over...
Hello. I am Meryhew Saks. The song is called "Murder By Numbers." The performers are a group called The Police. Adam here... ... from Behavioral Science is working out exactly what this perpetrator is trying to telegraph in the note. This is an extremely complex case, and we have a lot of fancy theories floating around. We're not ruling out the possib- ility of
We don't see too many lady homicide detectives. You have <u>my</u> respect. Have you discussed the note with Dr. Hudson?
I was just about to advise the Inspector here not to show Dr. Hudson the note.
Sir, Doctor Hudson and I see a pattern develop...
We know Helen. She's not exactly a credible collaborator. Especially late in the day...
She takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes.
How come you're so up on Dr. Hudson?
She is a writer, writing best selling books about serial killing. Giving lectures she's well-paid for. Her interests are not the interests of law enforcement.
Okay.
I was.
I'm over here? What's your name, Officer?
Michael Johnson.
You touch anything, Mike? Pick up anything? Use the doorknob? I don't want to find your prints on anything later and you tell me you forgot to tell me.
Whatever it is, I'm gonna find out and sooner is a hell of lot better than later.
Well, there's something missing in there. There was something around her neck when I came in there, but it's gone now.
Who came in after you?
What am I wasting my time with this shit for?
Because it's your job, that's all.
Not what I meant; why <u>me</u>?
Working late. You're a damn fool.
It's none of my business anymore...
You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business.
Well, you outranked <u>me</u>, Nikko.
Yeah. And you used that. Used <u>me</u>
Don't put yourself down like that. I <u>never</u> used you. I worked my way up like a marine grunt!
Yeah, you did that too. You earned what you got; don't shit on it, that's all I'm saying.
If this is just the dump site, where did he do the job? Where did he pick her up?
Quinn will be here any minute. What are you going to say?
Christ. I didn't lock the fucking drawer! You spend twenty years thinking some perp's gonna whack you... you'll crash your car... but what happens is, you fuck yourself... You can't imagine how many times I saw you two... your head together, I wish him dead. Every time... Want to hear something weird? I feel like I'd give my life to bring him back.
You're in terrible trouble, Nikko.
I heard. Good police work.
Just horseshit luck.
My third grade teacher at the convent shot better than that.
Answer it.
You're good enough you'll never have to kill anyone. I joined the cops to save lives, not waste them.
Get Mercer to run the medical, dental, legal bills, laundry and dry cleaning receipts, extermin- ators, mailmen, grocery and drugstore deliveries, handymen, plumbers...
Snotty neurotic bitch...
Classy madonna.
Sure. She likes <u>you</u>, Rube. She likes the way you move. She sure as hell isn't in love with me.
You came in there with this attitude...
What's wrong with him?
He's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine. We heard from Doctor Hudson?
Nada. Lemme make the call.
Honest to God, Ruben!
I like women like that!
You said you don't give a fuck and that's the beauty of a breakdown? This doesn't look like not giving a fuck, you know that?
You got a tape backup, yeah, here lemme copy it on tape...
Absolutely.
Is Niccoletti <u>assigned</u> here?
She didn't fight back, no hair or skin under her fingernails. I'm not seeing any bruises or contusions...
What about her arms?
She's blue as hell. No marks on her neck. Asphyxiated? not the same -- no ligature marks. Outdoors...
Look at her legs.
Ruben, my God, I ought to put you on report.
You're right. I can't stand that bastard. Sorry. This is something new. Not the same guy, that's for sure.
Get the pictures, and casts of footprints.
Now listen up, Ruben. You never, never, never mess with somebody <u>inside</u> the case!
Excuse me? <u>Excuse me</u>?! What do you...
You damn well better start working on that impulse control. A woman who is implicated in this case? Someone who's practically a piece of <u>evidence</u>?
It's against your rules that I try to help a witness who's scared shitless? Who's...
What's Abba?
She wants me to check the phone booth for a note.
The woman was in shock. She was totally out on ranks. I stayed because I didn't want her to wake up alone in a place where she'd just been under attack. Stop that, you son of a bitch! The place wasn't secure. I was doing my goddamn job! And, for the <u>second time</u>, I slept in her living room.
Don't try to lie, Ruben. You don't have the face for it. I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson's place...
I'll talk to Conrad myself. I'll be in the jail when you wind this up...
You messed with the scene.
I tagged the goddamned stocking. It ain't lost. We're sequestering that evidence. That's the trap some son of a bitch is going to fall into...
Am I in charge of this thing? Or not.
You didn't say serial killer and I didn't say serial killer.
Right.
This is the anniversary of the summer of love and your city fathers have declared a Festival of Love. The Mayor and Chamber of Commerce don't want TV announcing killers on the loose.
We're gonna have a bunch of clapped out old hippies blissing on the Grateful Dead! Sleeping in the park, smoking dope and sticking tulips up their ass.
There was no sperm.
The same as the firs two. Definitely a serial.
What are you looking at that for? Helen Hudson. Work the clues.
What clues? I'm going to work Helen Hudson.
I'm <U>telling</u> you. Don't you <u>ever</u> address me publicly in that tone. You'll work what and <u>who</u> I tell you to work.
Anybody in this department ever worked a serial killer case? She's the expert. I need help.
How about I put Nikko on it?
Sergeant?
Yessir.
You ever reflect how this big explosion in dead women coincides with the flowering of women's lib?
Don't swear at me because we got problems. I'm just giving you the news. I went to a Catholic school; I'll tell you what they teach. On the knuckles they teach.
Who've I got to beat up except the messenger? Does this give us anything to go on?
I'm checking out anybody who lives like DeSalvo. Records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green. Checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile. Cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling. If they've got a German wife. We can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon.
I know. Get out here.
So. Do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information?
Oh, maaaaan?!
What? I talk like a cop, this is the way I talk. I can't believe this guy. Saks. He's a Deputy Assistant Director of the F.B.I. "Let me help you!"
We could use a little help.
So what have we got?
It's not the same guy. It should be a self-solver. No bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely different. The others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way inside, killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom. This one didn't have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI, asphyxiation probably
Christ. How old are you? You sure you want to be in this line of work?
You're damn right I do.
Okay, now what about your sidekick punching my favorite detective? What the hell is going on? You got no discipline in your operation.
Where you going?
Helen Hudson...
What the hell you need her for?
M.J., I'm going to have to borrow Ruben. The alien-smuggling thing in Chinatown is going down tomorrow night and Jack's kid got hit by a car. I gotta give Ruben to Nikko.
What does this mean? Now we got the FBI, my team is expendable? I'm working my ass off, is anybody listening? Why Ruben, anyway? He and Nikko don't even get on together...
Teach both of them a lesson in cooperation and self-discipline.
If this is a first step in kicking me off the case, just tell me, to my face, sir, don't waste time being diplomatic.
Just, I need results. And -- I am short-handed. Who else am I gonna give him?
I didn't want the Illigals, I wanted just the bastards dumping them in the harbor. What's keeping those bums at Immigration? Nightmare in here...
The prowler in Hudson's apartment turns out to have a meeting with a suspect...
You got a suspect...
How'd you get in on the deal?
I'm gonna drop charges on the break-and-enter at Hudson's...
You have no authority to make a deal like that. That' s for the D.A...
Or the F.B.I.?
Saks. If he knew you did that! They're all asking me, 'what is she doing,' as it is.
Give me Ruben back...
You want mine, too? You take his, you take mine. I'm the one fucked it up...
That was Bundy. He killed forty of them, identical, long hair, parted in the middle, alike as Barbie dolls. ...this is hopeless. Let's try to get time for a police spokesman to appear on college radio and TV hookups and broadcast a warning?
She's in no shape to give her statement tonight...
I just got here myself, Susan.
...confirm this third murder adds up to a pattern? Do we have a serial killer on the loose in the city?
... third Bay Area woman has been strangled, but the police continue to deny that this is the work of one killer. Lt. Thomas Quinn declares that the murders will be treated as unrelated crimes, unless new evidence...
Detective Niccoletti?
Inspector, will you confirm somebody is copying the Boston Strangler? This is the fourth, is that correct?
He's not treating her right...
She left you, Nikko. She's not your responsibility. She takes very good care of herself. If she wants to romance the kid, it ain't your business. Your business is to snap out of it.
We were together six years, sir!
Don't give me six years! You never divorced Patty, did you? So what'd you expect from M.J.?
She knows I'm Catholic! She never mentioned divorce! Not once!
Then you shoulda known she wasn't buying. She was just long-term leasing' you. Ah, Nickie. Except for that rare twenty-second twitch, there ain't nothin' about sex I don't hate. But of course, I'm Irish. Plus I got <u>real</u> problems. I'm worried I might have to put you in over M.J. There's something going on here, the Commissioner is targeting her now, I can't leave
I don't want the job. Don't do that to her. She's worked too damned hard for it.
Put in the Kevin Costner.
Why don't we save it for later? It's almost time for Letterman.
See, now you've annoyed her. You know she doesn't like you to touch me. Does she, widdle wee fing! Wuhve you so much! Did you feed her?
Yes, I fed her. If she says she's hungry, she's lying to you. Again.
She doesn't lie! You sure you fed her?
She lies all the time. Why would I say I fed her if I didn't?
Where were you?
In the private aircraft hangar. Anybody could have walked in.
Did you come?
No. What about your camera girl? Did she come?
Poor darling. What can I do about Karen? How can I arrange to have her seduce me? She desperately needs a conquest.
There, that's better.
Not a lot of action here.
They consider this to be the airport hospital. This ward is reserved for air- crash victims. The beds are kept waiting.
If I groundloop during my flying lesson on Saturday you might wake up and find me next to you.
Is that a gift from Wendel? It has an aeronautical feel to it.
That's going well, then.
The other man, the dead man, his wife is a doctor - Dr. Helen Remington. She's here, somewhere. As a patient, of course. Maybe you'll find her in the hallways tomorrow on your walk.
And her husband? What was he?
Where's the car?
Outside in the visitors, car park.
What!? They brought the car here?
My car, not yours. Yours is a complete wreck. The police dragged it to the pound behind the station.
Have you seen it?
The sergeant asked me to identify it. He didn't believe you'd gotten out alive.
It's about time.
It is?
Minute flecks were spattered across the seat and steering wheel. The instrument panel was buckled inwards, cracking the clock and the speedometer dials. The cabin was deformed, and there was dust and glass and plastic flakes everywhere inside. The carpeting was damp and stank of blood and other body and machine fluids.
You should have gone to the funeral.
I wish I had. They bury the dead so quickly - they should leave them lying around for months.
What about his wife? The woman doctor? Have you visited her yet?
Renata tells me you're going to rent a car.
I can't sit on this balcony forever. I'm beginning to feel like a potted plant.
How can you drive? James... your legs. You can Barely walk.
Is the traffic heavier now? There seem to be three times as many cars as there were before the accident.
I've never really noticed. Is Renata going with you?
I thought she might come along. Handling a car again might be more tiring than I imagine.
I'm amazed that she'll let you drive her.
You're not envious?
He must have tucked a lot of women in that huge car of his. It's like a bed on wheels. It must smell of semen...
It does.
Do you find him attractive?
He's very pale. Covered with scars.
Would you like to tuck him, though? In that car?
No. But when he's in that car...
Have you seen his penis?
I think it's badly scarred too. From a motorcycle accident.
They're questioning Vaughan about an accident near the airport. Some pedestrian... they think he was run over intentionally.
You'd better drive him. He's a bit shaky. I'll follow in my car. Where is yours?
At home. I couldn't face all this traffic.
I thought that was you, up there.
I wasn't driving. I'd left the car in the parking lot at the airport. Could it have been deliberate?
One of your suitors?
The traffic... where is everyone? They've all gone away.
I'd like to go back. James...
I think he'll be waiting for us at the airport
After this sort of thing, how do people manage to look at a car, let alone drive one? I'm trying to find Charles's car.
It's not here. Maybe the police are still holding it. Their forensic people...
I don't think we should have come here. I'm surprised the police don't make it more difficult.
Were you badly hurt? I think we saw each other at the hospital. I don't want the car. In fact, I was appalled to find that I have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped.
You haven't told me where we're going.
The airport? Why? Are you leaving?
Not yet - though not soon enough for some people, I've already found. A death in the doctor's family makes the patients doubly uneasy.
I take it you're not wearing white to reassure them.
I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.
So - why the airport?
Do you want a cigarette? I started to smoke at the hospital. It's rather stupid of me.
Look at all this traffic. I'm not sure I can deal with it.
It's much worse now. You noticed that, did you? The day I left the hospital I had the extraordinary feeling that all these cars were gathering for some special reason I didn't understand. There seemed to be ten times as much traffic.
I've found that I enjoy burying myself in heavy traffic. I like to look at it. Yesterday I hired a taxi driver to drive me around for an hour. "Anywhere", I said.
We sat in B massive traffic jam under an off-ramp. I don't think we moved more than fifty yards. I'm thinking of taking up a new job with the Road Research Laboratory. They need a medical officer. The salary is larger something I've got to think about now. There's a certain moral virtue in being materialistic, I'm beginning to feel. Well, it's a new
The Road Research Laboratory? Where they simulate car crashes?
Yes.
Isn't that rather too close...?
Who is that? The announcer. Do I know him?
That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.
Oh yes. I thought he was a medical photographer, doing some sort of accident research. He wanted every conceivable detail about our crash.
Is this part of the act or are they really hurt?
Please finish your story.
The junior pathologist at Ashford Hospital. Then the husband of a colleague of mine, then a trainee radiologist, then the service manager at my garage.
And you had sex with all of these men in cars? Only in cars?
Yes. I didn't plan it that way.
And did you fantasize that Vaughan was photographing all these sex acts? As though they were traffic accidents?
Are we allowed to park here?
No.
There's still a patch of blood there on the road. Did you see it?
I saw the blood. It looks like motor oil.
You were the last one I saw just before the accident. Do you remember? We made love.
Can you drive?
What is it?
A complimentary ticket for a special stunt-driving exhibition. Definitely not part of the big auto show. There's a map in the packet and a note requesting you be discrete about the location.
Really? What kind of exhibition is it?
I suspect it involves reenactments of famous car crashes. You know, Jayne Mansfield, James Dean, Albert Camus...
You're kidding.
Serious. But you'll have to take your new friend, the female crash-test dummy. She dropped it off for you.
What does he want from you?
Hard to say.
I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
Crash victim?
Why are the police taking this all so seriously?
Do you live here? With Seagrave?
What exactly is your project, Vaughan? ~ book of crashes? A medical study? A sensational documentary? Global traffic?
I've always wanted to drive a crashed car.
You could get your wish at any moment.
No, I mean a crash with a history. Camus' Facel Vega, or Nathaniel Nest's station wagon, Grace Kelly's Rover 3500. Fix it just enough to get it rolling. Don't clean it, don't touch anything else.
Is that why you drive this car? I take it that you see Kennedy's assassination as a special kind of car-crash?
It's very... satisfying. I'm not sure I understand why.
It's the future, Ballard, and you're already part of it. For the first time, a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us. For example, the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event - a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form. To fully understand that, and to live that...
What about the reshaping of the human body by modern technology? I thought that was your project.
He must have driven through a pool of blood. If the police stop you again, they may impound the car while they have the blood analyzed. Vaughan kneels beside him and inspects the smears of blood.
I need to see you, Ballard. I need to talk to you about the project.
Hello, Letitia. I'm Dr. Emlee, and I have some questions to ask you...
I did this already.
I'm the only doctor making rounds this morning.
Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest.
This doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?
I'm afraid Lhe's not a doctor.
Psychologist, therapist, whatever.
Patient.
What kind of place is this?
I apologize for the inconvenience, but I must ask you some...
I want to see my mother immediately.
We discourage family visits for the first 48 hours after an emotional trauma like the kind you've experienced.
Do we have to talk about this?
The medicine's still bothering me. It feels like I have cotton wrapped around my brain.
The question, Letty, is how are you feeling?
I couldn't really say anything because of that fraternizing rule.
Well, Letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.
I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee. I can take care of myself.
What about Michael? Do you know the extent of his...
I know Michael's a schizophrenic, and Mrs. Hallstrom's manic- depressive, and John Lockyer has episodes of psychosis, and I heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur.
Go ahead and put the guard back up, Letty. But you need to know what you're dealing with.
I don't need a lecture. I care about Michael.
Look, I know he's almost through with treatment here. And, he's on medication.
Drugs can help suppress symptoms. But lots of patients stop taking them when they're on their own because the side effects are so harsh. And, Michael's condition is often worsened by periods of stress. He's been in and out of...
First you tell me to do what I want to, then you tell me to stop.
But what I really can't believe is that I'm starting to actually miss work.
Have you been in contact with the principal about your job?
I thought about calling, but I want to wait until I know when I'll be out.
Then, you should call.
What?
I think it's about that time, Letty. The charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well.
So, we'll meet every Tuesday and Friday. And if you have any kind of emergency, you can page me.
OK, good. That's good. Thanks an awful lot for everything, and for coming down here to see me off.
It was just a little going-away gesture.
I have a going-away gesture for you, too.
What's up with you?
Just go ahead and tell us.
No, really. Tell me about the promotion.
She says she won't even come if Dad brings Monica.
How?
I'll talk to her, and to Dad, too. A few wisely-chosen guilt tactics and they'll be ours.
Maybe.
Oh, wait a minute, now I see where you're going.
Please, Letty.
Maybe, though. Maybe it would work. I could throw you an engagement party maybe.
You know what, Ruthie? I better get back to my class, OK?
And the party?
Where's the old bag I sometimes call Mommy?
What do you think of this one?
Things have been kind of stressful lately.
Yeah, everything's under control.
What about the engagement party?
Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery.
What about this one?
You look beautiful.
Really?
Hi, Mom.
Go on, Letty. I want to see it on you.
How can I help?
Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it?
Fuck me.
What's all the dreck?
Sage, rosemary... Les Herbes.
It'll be fine.
Letty, dinner's almost ready. The souffle...
I can't believe you finally gave me the shirt.
Loaned you. And it's only 'til you get out of here.
That settles it. I'm never leaving.
I can hardly wait 'til you're free. Planning the wedding without you has been a disaster.
You're slowing.
What do you think?
Ecru.
Do we have to talk wedding details?
What's his name, Letty?
I don't think people even noticed. I thought the ceremony was perfect.
You did the right thing.
Oh, Ruthie, what am I going to do?
You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
But what am I going to do?
Do you want to go see him? I'll take you if you want to go.
I was so sure. I really thought it would work. We have plans, Ruth.
How wonderful, darling. What does that mean for you?
I'll be running it three days a week, and...
Will you get time off to do that?
Are you sure, Dear?
My goodness. A wedding. My goodness.
Tell us every detail.
Has Paul heard about his promotion?
Oh no.
Paul could pop the question at any time.
Mom, please.
I gather he's late as usual.
I'm here, Sweetheart. I'm here. It's going to be OK.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Oh, Letty, what happened?
Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so... They didn't have the olives, and I, I got so upset. I don't know how it happened.
I've talked to Doctor Emlee, and he says...
I'm so glad to see you. You can't believe the people in here. They've got patients posing as doctors...
Everyone says it's the best facility in the area for this sort of thing.
Maybe I should talk about this with Ruth, or Paul.
Yes.
But what about Beast? Who'll...?
Ruth's already taken him home.
And my class. It'll be hard to find a good substitute. And what about my math program?
I'll see you soon.
Tomorrow?
It's so good to see you, Sweetheart.
You too, Mom.
Which flowers did you order?
We haven't. I wanted to talk that over with you, too.
Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway.
We aren't allowed to wear jewelry in here, Mom.
I haven't had a crush since I was
I hear this Michael fellow is schizophrenic.
Mom, please.
Don't forget that Paul's a promising young attorney who loves you very much...
I'm only looking out for you.
Must you walk so quickly?
I'm so thankful you'll be leaving next week. If you want me to pick you up, I will.
Mom, we agreed. You can visit, but you're not allowed to mention Michael.
Honestly, Letty.
Michael just got a job. Couldn't you congratulate him?
I will, Dear. I promise. Why McDonald's?
I'm going to take that as an honest effort at being open minded.
Don't be fresh.
I'm really not that hungry.
Letty, you should be in bed.
There's a spider in my room.
Yeah?
It's got a green dot on its back. I can't go to sleep with it watching me.
It had this red spot on its back.
Green spot.
I don't know why you feel you have to lie, Letty.
Lie?
If you feel lonely, or need to talk, all you have to do is say so.
To talk? Well, OK, that might be good.
I don't mean to go on and on like this.
You can only do what feels best to you now.
You've been so great. I just feel a lot clearer about things.
Do you mind if I call you Letitia?
Letty.
First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?
I answered these questions last night.
No, 79. Sorry, this makes me nervous.
Chair, cup and ball.
Let me shift gears here a minute... Do you ever hear voices that other people don't hear or see things they don't?
No.
Yes? Go right ahead.
How do you sort it--by lace and cotton?
By color.
What if it's got a pattern?
A while, I guess.
Hey there. They're showing "Groundhog Day" if you...
You took bets on my diagnosis?
It's no big deal. We all compare.
Don't take it personally.
You have no right, no right to take the worst thing that's ever happened to me and make it into some kind of game.
Stop acting like you're someone special. You're just like the rest of us.
What are you looking to read?
But you're checking it out.
You missed out on some great broccoli florets at dinner.
I wasn't hungry.
John even managed to lob a load of mashed potatoes into Mrs. Hallstrom's milk.
Finally. I was getting tired of watching him try every night.
Was it bad news--the visit from Peter?
He asked me to marry him.
Very romantic setting.
It was romantic. He's very romantic.
What have you done with the ring?
Guess which hand.
Enough with the abracadabra.
Guess.
Really, this isn't funny.
For a price.
Good God.
A small price.
I won't do your portion of kitchen cleanup.
No.
We're supposed to be asleep.
We'll get caught.
Nervous? Scared? Worried you're not fit for a caper of epic proportions?
Don't be ridiculous.
A daisy for the lady.
The lady knows this is a dandelion.
Thanks. Where've you been all day?
I'm not allowed to see you anymore.
Really? Me too.
I had to sneak by the guards to get here. They say you're highly unstable, have a depressive personality, and may hold back my own recovery.
Wow. I'm bad news.
What's my rap?
Really, though. My thoughts go haywire sometimes.
Shocking, huh?
Sure. But I took out a whole grocery store.
I wish I could have seen that.
I'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent.
Why in the world did you let me start talking in metaphors? That's no way for us to break up.
You must have thought about it. Everyone does.
I just want to see Beast. Where would you go?
The mission up in Santa Barbara.
No way.
What else would you do?
I'd like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together. And we'd get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper.
And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed from the can.
How can you even mention Spaghetti- O's after eating Grandma Rosa's dinner tonight?
I have a terrible confession.
Tell the doctor.
Then it's over.
It's a good thing my family loves you.
Your family just met me.
You're right. I guess I was projecting. What I should have said is, "It's a good thing I love you."
Do you?
I do.
Michael, I...
It's OK. You don't have to say anything.
John and Nurse Gates are waiting for you.
Oh, right. I'm ready. How do I look?
Well?
Tell me all.
I was brilliant, or at least boringly sane.
So there were no problems?
Not a one.
Just checking.
I saw Paul leaving. Did you do the dirty deed?
Yeah.
So, it's over?
Furnished?
No, I need some serious household advice.
First off, you'll need to go to Target. And, let's see, what should you buy?
I better make a list.
Aren't you supposed to throw a bouquet or something?
Where to?
This is it -- 3B. Check it out.
Wow.
I love the pillows.
Throw pillows, Letty. The sales lady said they're the latest thing.
It's TV heaven.
I was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch. Now we can watch two shows at once.
You've got to see the kitchen first.
Do you like it?
I love your apartment.
What do you say we go out to dinner to celebrate?
How can you not like the Top 10 List?
I like it. But Headlines are better.
Hey.
Did I get spaghetti sauce on my face?
Michael.
Not yet.
I'm supposed to meet the principal in half an hour.
Good luck.
Sounds good. Oh, and Letty?
Yeah?
Gosh, Letty, this is a great place.
This must be Beast.
I bombed. It's either work in the office or nothing.
Sounds grim.
Who ever said sanity was fun?
It doesn't matter. It'll work out.
Promise?
Promise. As long as we have steak.
The store was busy.
You got wine. That's great.
Would you mind if we just called it an early night?
You go ahead and relax. I'll cook.
I think I should go home.
Are you OK?
Four interviews. Four no-gos.
The restaurant, too?
That's OK. We can call and reschedule in the morning.
Just promise you'll love me even if I end up in a job where I have to wear a blue polyester cap.
You're going to miss the Top Ten.
Hey, Letty. Mrs. Mayer.
How may I help you?
Aunt Lily is the one who married your father's cousin?
No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is the one who looks like a hooker.
Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?
Aunt Lily?
Something like that.
When he could get time off from the restaurant business.
Bye, Uncle Cort. What's with the lie?
What is it? Are you OK?
Always the drugs.
What?
I saw you talking to my Mom.
What do you mean not taking your meds?
Why'd you tell?
Silly? Silly am I?
Michael, take it easy.
Silly, silly, silly.
Don't upset my Mom. Don't you upset my Mom.
I guess we need to talk.
I guess so.
I sure know what that feels like.
And all the plans we have.
I've been thinking I could try to visit you at night after work, and then there'd be more time on weekends to see...
Like I've told you before I don't want you taking care of me.
Someone has to take care of you right now, Michael. You tore up the apartment. You stopped taking your medications.
But that wasn't me. I didn't mean to do that.
Well then why'd it happen?
I'm sorry. I didn't come here to blame you.
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
What are we going to do?
What do you want to do?
I love you so much.
Maybe we could just run away to Tahiti and live on the beach.
Don't you have a magic trick or something to make this easier?
Would that really be such a good idea for either of us?
Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?
I guess I should go now.
So, another one bites the dust.
It's not another one. It's my sister. Aren't you happy for her?
Can I put these here for tonight?
In there's better. It's kind of romantic, don't you think?
Believe me, I know your feelings on the matter.
My math program. The Superintendent said he'd fund it.
Yeah?
I was thinking dinner on Friday with James and Meg at the Saint Mark.
Actually, I need to review the deposition questions tonight. Maybe tomorrow?
Oh, ok. Maybe.
But I thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how I come across?
What are you doing? You're going to be late.
You don't have a fever.
I don't feel like going to work today.
But what about that math project?
Paul, I just can't go. Is that OK with you or am I committing some horrible crime?
Forget I asked.
I'm sorry. I'm just...I'm so tired lately.
Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
It's just I've got those parent conferences, and I'm supposed to set up the math program by next week. And shopping for Ruth's dress and that, that engagement dinner.
You can get out of the dinner.
No, I can't. I've already convinced both Mom and Dad to come.
I don't think so.
Of course it will. Remember the big talent show you planned last year? And what about the Christmas benefit when Santa canceled at the last minute? But you still pulled it off.
Yeah.
You know what I think we need? Martinis. How about martinis to celebrate?
What are you doing?
Can you loan me a 20?
Sure. Why?
I'm going to the store.
It's prettier here than I thought it would be.
Yeah, I guess it's all right.
Are you all right?
That's a big question.
I hope it wasn't something I did.
Of course not, no. Is that why you're here?
I think we need to talk about some things.
Yes, I suppose so.
No.
Especially this last year.
Especially now.
I talked to Ruth a little bit, and I think it's about time...
I know. We can't just keep going through the motions.
Exactly. It's time to make decisions.
You don't have to say anything else. I've known for a while that this was coming.
I had to smuggle it in here. I guess you're not really supposed to have jewelry.
Or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients.
I hope you like it. It's a Marquis cut, 1.5 carats. They had one with emeralds around it, but this was simpler, more classic in its lines. Letty?
No, you've done a perfect job.
Sure. We'll save the formal announcement for when you're out. I already told your mother. I hope you don't mind.
No, no.
So will you?
What's so urgent? You've got me worried.
You can tell me anything. Do you want to postpone the wedding? Is it too much pressure?
No...
You what?
I don't mean to hurt you. I know this is a terrible thing. And I have really loved you.
Whoa. Whoa. Have really loved me? Letty, it's natural to be nervous. But we're going to work through our problems.
I've met someone else.
Who?
It doesn't matter who.
Have you been seeing another teacher?
No.
It's a doctor, isn't it? That's unethical. I'll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin.
Of all the crazy things. I understood when you dropped out of law school. And during this whole mess, I've tried to be supportive. But, really, Letty, what can you be thinking?
I love him.
You're going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney-tune that you misguidedly think is love?
Here's the ring.
I'm glad you agreed to see me.
I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
Oh, none. None. I completely understand what was going on.
Oh.
How's work going? Are you back at school?
Getting back.
I heard about your friend.
What?
I heard your friend was back in the hospital.
Our relationship meant a lot to me, too, Paul. But it's over. And Michael being in the hospital doesn't really change things.
I think I've heard this speech before.
I've got a deposition that I really need to get cracking on, so if you don't mind...
The Superintendent was just getting ready to leave.
Well, I understand. I know my behavior was poor.
So, in light of how the parents feel, and the fact the students are doing so well with the substitute, I don't think I can put you back in the classroom just yet.
Look, Gail, I've been a good teacher.
I know, Letty. But the incident with Zach was frightening for the children. Now if you'd come to me, explained what was going on...
Believe me, I wish I'd understood what was going on. I've worked really hard to get better.
I'm glad you're doing well.
It's a very nice letter. But I have to go with what's best for the students.
What does that mean?
I need someone to work on budget projections.
Office work?
All tapped out.
How's it look?
Shhh. They're coming to the cubic zirconium.
I like those sapphire earrings myself.
Mrs. Hallstrom, why don't you join my family for dinner. You'll love my Grandma Rosa.
We're talking Matisse, Renoir, Monet. We know for sure they replaced Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve sunflowers" last week with a copy. It was on loan from the London National Gallery and they're not going to be very happy when they find out about it.
So Bastaldi makes a deal with the Feds to trade up for his brother?
Agent Hadley.
Do you know who this is?
Yeah. I figured I'd be hearing from you.
What are you doing?
You think I'm going to talk to you until I know if you're wired.
Okay. Okay. I believe you.
You killed her!
No. You killed her. Manager remembers you going into her room. Your fingerprints were found all over the place.
Bullshit! She was alive when we left her with you.
You're fucked, Sami. You know it. That's why you're here.
Look, I just want out of this nightmare. I don't know these guys. A few days ago I'm in Paris picking pockets and now I'm America's most wanted.
Where are the tapes?
I can get them -- but what do I get if I do?
A pass.
A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene.
Witness' can be convinced they made a mistake. Without the murder weapon the D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you.
They don't have a murder weapon?
You want the tapes for yourself. You're going to sell them.
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
Yes I did. Lose ends are messy.
What about me? Aren't I a loose end?
When this is over you can say whatever the hell you want. I'll be long gone. Besides, who's going to believe you? You're just a two-bit crook.
What the fuck was all that about at the hotel last night? I thought we had a deal?
You want the tapes for yourself. You're going to sell them.
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
Zero. That's all I know.
This is turning to shit. If word gets out of my involvement in this I'll go to prison.
Listen, we know their names. They don't know the city. You'll find them. You're the FBI.
I can't bring the Bureau into this. If I do the tapes become evidence.
They're supposed to be evidence. That's why Bastaldi set this up.
Fuck Bastaldi and his brother. These tapes are gold. Do you have any idea what Zammito would pay to get them back?
I thought you wanted Zammito?
Too many people know about my involvement in this.
Uh... excuse me, but don't you need a warrant or something?
Not today. Where are your friends?
They left about a half hour ago.
Where did they go?
Hey man, you can't do that!
Jesus. What kind of FBI agent are you?
I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare. Now, if you don't want me to keep on hurting you, it's important that I believe you and right now I don't. So tell me, where did they go?
Hello?
It's Elvis...
Who?
It's me...
Yes. We went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some Mafia guy.
You're there now?
Oui.
You're calling me on your cell phone, right?
No.
You're calling me on is phone?
Oui.
My number's going to show up on his bill!
You've already robbed the safe?
Oui.
Where's your brother?
Hey Daniel! Hello? Do you guys speak English?
Uh, yeah.
Thank you Marcel, for that... extremely redundant explanation.
C'mon, Laurant, America?
I thought I would accompany you to the airport to say bon voyage... and tell you that Marcel will be going with you.
What?
This is a considerable move up for you, Daniel. The temptation of having so much money might be too much for you.
You don't trust me?
Hello?
It's Daniel.
Daniel. Listen I'm afraid there has been a big--
-- I've got the tapes. If you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what I say. Bring one million euros to your boat at six o'clock.
A million! I don't have that kind of money.
Don't bullshit me, Laurant! I know about the Van Gogh.
I don't have it. That's why Vincent went to Chicago. They arrested him before he could bring it back.
Good. I'm doing good. How you doin', Frankie?
Good. I'm good.
Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
Can I offer you something. A drink? Coffee?
No thank you.
You sure? I just got a shipment of espresso from Sicily. Special blend. Can't find anything like it in the States.
I'm good. Really.
Okay. I understand you're interested in one of our properties?
Yeah. That warehouse over on Merchant Street. The volume on our import business has risen dramatically. The proceeds this quarter will be supernumerary due to the --
-- Super what?
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
Then why not just fuckin' say better than expected? Everybody knows what better than expected means.
I'm taking a vocabulary course to enhance my communication skills.
Okay. How much?
I'm not here to negotiate.
Why are you here?
To tell you that we're interested in the property.
You told me that on the phone. What the hell are you doing here? Showing off your communication skills? Go back to your people and tell them when they're serious to put a number on the table.
I will relay the particulars of our conversation to Mr. Maranzano.
Frankie, come in. Good to see you. You want something?
I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today.
Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
And?
And nothing. He's just feeling us out.
He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory.
He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off.
Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property.
They're gonna be what?
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
Someone else coming?
Nah, that's just Tony's way of telling me Judge Judy starts in ten minutes. You ever watch it?
Uh, no --
You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me.
Oh Frankie, what's this I hear about your brother?
He missed three weeks.
Your own brother? You couldn't send someone else to do it?
I did. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" did the deed.
But you were there?
Why didn't you tell me about this?
They knew who you were when they broke in your house?
Yes.
What is happening with the world? There was a time no civilian would touch a made man. Now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something. What did they take?
Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can replace, but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother. They're the only ones I have of her.
Either you are incredibly brave, or incredibly stupid. Which one is it?
I guess we're going to find out.
You rob an associate of mine... a friend and--
I've got to tell you, Mr. Bonanno, This guy's an idiot. How he's lived this long is a mystery.
I don't think it will be a mystery much longer.
He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.
I assume you want something?
We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home.
And for my help I would get what?
Half the tapes.
And the other half?
I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris.
I only have your word for that.
I just want to get my people home. I know who you are and what you could do to me if I don't honor my word.
I only ask so I can call you when the arrangements are made.
This plane will take you to Canada. From there you can fly back to Paris.
Thank you.
Tonight?
I don't know.
For what?
Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.
What kind of business?
You know what makes a good get away driver? Being able to get away!
Not a good idea. Someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you. Raymond, you'll steal one.
Yeah. We just go home.
We can't.
No one has mentioned the part of the plan about us getting caught and going to prison.
Forget the money! We've got bigger problems than the money right now.
Why not just steal another one?
Get that, will you?
Why do I always have to answer the phone?
Because you're the closest.
Why is everything an argument with you?
Raymond, grab the tapes. We're leaving!
Why do I have to pick up the tapes.
In English. Sami doesn't speak French.
Hopefully no one.
I just want you there in case there's trouble.
And if there is, then Zero can kill someone?
He said to go fuck yourself.
We are being watched. Daniel grabs the binoculars and looks.
Bastaldi's dead. He is fuckin' dead!
You want Zero to kill him?
I'm going to kill him myself!
Bring me the scissors.
Cut his pants up the leg to the groin.
Turn on the flashlight.
Do they come with batteries?
You didn't buy batteries?
I thought they came with batteries.
I can't believe you didn't check.
I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list.
Sami, tomorrow you lift a wallet from someone who looks like one of us.
What for?
That's an excellent plan. Very comforting.
Besides, we don't know the city and--
You think it's smart to tell him we're French?
That moron.
It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway... Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.
The deal is whatever Mr. Bastaldi says it is.
Did you know about Bastaldi's deal with Zammito?
No.
You're sure?
Fuck you! You know I'd never go along with something like this.
Do I?
You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better?
I'm not a guy who is known for his patience and right now you're testing mine.
We had a chance to walk out of Zammito's house.
We all agreed to it. You had no way of knowing Bastaldi was setting us up.
We still have to get out of here.
This is Zero.
After the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window.
We've got to be careful not to use our real names while we're in here.
Good idea.
It's not?
How'd it go? I don't know. Daniel, how would you say it went?
What's the big deal? It's not like I was on guard duty or something.
You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you?
They'll be waiting for us at the airport.
You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
It makes sense. I mean, do you really think he would come along if he knew we were being set up?
All right, knock it off.
Hadley --
It's not your fault, Daniel.
Okay. Airports, train stations, bus station are out. We know they're connected to the car rental agencies because that's where they picked up Raymond.
Hello?
What's he joking around for? He's been shot.
Anybody hungry?
What'd you get?
What?
Can I trust you, Sami?
Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.
No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead.
You haven't answered my question.
Does it really matter what I say?
I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.
I will.
Did you have to use that much explosive?
I'll be right back. He gets out of the car and walks over to him.
What do you want now?
Guns. Can you get them?
Man, I can get anything.
Don't bullshit me.
I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns. I can get any kind of gun you want. But they ain't gonna help your sorry ass. You ain't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you. How is that possible?
I've got a way with people.
I can see that. The man's car you stole. Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy motherfucker. And Frankie Zammito's got the word out he's looking for some French dudes. You're French ain't ya?
I'm from Belgium.
Yeah, I'd be from Belgium too if I was you. You know Zammito just put his own brother in the hospital? Broke his arm cause he was late on a debt. I mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin' for you.
Why haven't you turned us in?
And, uh, I'm going to have to charge you a commission... kind of like a brokerage fee.
How much?
A thousand dollars?
Yeah?
It's me.
Hey you guys are becoming famous. I was just watching the news and--
-- Did you set it up?
Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on River Street. Oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, I'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.
We had a deal.
We had a deal before you and your friends became the new poster boys for crime.
There's ten grand in here. It's yours. I'm going to call you again. There's one more thing I need you to do.
What?
Okay, we're square now, right?
Maybe you should call the police.
Hey, idiot -- I've got stolen wheels and a stolen radio in the car.
I just thought that--
-- you stole my cousin Enrique's car.
Hector, don't interrupt me.
He told Enrique he didn't know anything about his car.
Tell me the truth Hector... do you think we'll find my car?
What'd I tell you? Huh, Vinny? What'd I tell you when you came to me for money? Didn't I ask you not to do it? Did I not say that? What'd I say to him?
You said don't do it, boss.
Hey boss, it's not a science.
They were all French guys.
French guys? You mean like from France?
Yeah, French guys from France.
What'd they take?
Everything.
Everything?
Everything.
Boy, you must be pissed.
Well, you know, when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night, stick guns in my face, tie me up and steal from me... it does irritate me.
Well, I must say you're handling it very well.
You know why I'm handling it very well? Because you're going to get these guys for me.
Okay boss. Where are they?
If I knew where they were you wouldn't have to find them, would you?
You didn't say find them. You said, "get them."
Just find them!
But we ain't had nothing to eat all day boss.
Can you believe that guy? What a moron.
Good song though.
What'd you guys find?
Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln are your... associates.
And the other car?
Some French guy. At least that's what his passport said. You know Joey, I shouldn't be talking to you about this.
Are you forgetting who supplements your income?
No. It's just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is a homicide. Are you guys involved in this?
Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
What hotel?
The Holiday Hotel.
What room number?
I don't know. I didn't look.
The map said to go left.
Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
There has to be.
I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels.
What do we do?
I was told to take what we have and go.
They don't have a wine list.
There's an exterior alarm system. There's also another one in the hall that leads to the bedroom with a motion detector. The control panel is in the bedroom.
What about transportation?
No, I didn't.
Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
Yes.
And he gave it to us. 145 Ridgeway Road.
I'm Sami. Marcel sent me.
What is it you do, Sami?
You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.
I see. A master criminal.
They don't serve wine here.
What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?
This kind.
I don't know. Maybe if we did just leave --
No wonder Zammito didn't want us to walk out with this stuff. He's planning on killing Bonanno and taking over the family.
I knew this was a mistake! I knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this. I could hear that little voice in my head saying, "don't do it! Don't you do it!" Jesus, why don't I ever listen to myself?
This is bad. This is really fuckin' bad. Am I the only one who sees how bad this is?
Hey, it's not your picture on the TV, it's mine. So, try to be cool.
Don't tell me to be cool! We were supposed to be in and out. In and out! In the last twenty four hours we've managed to get the Mafia... the FBI... the Chicago Police Department and a group of Latin gang members after us. I haven't left out anyone, have I? I don't think so, because we've already pissed off everyone in the fuckin'
We've got to get out of here.
Maybe I'm missing the obvious, but why aren't we leaving town? Any place has to be safer for us than Chicago.
Oh, man... this is bullshit! You can't trust anyone these days.
I am not comfortable with this. I'm not a good liar.
I'll drive.
I'm the driver.
This is a car. I think this is the best American car I've ever driven.
I knew I should have driven.
When we get to the next corner jump out.
I'm not going to leave you.
A Black Panther was a member of an African American militant group in the sixties, Marcel. I think you're referring to The Pink Panther.
Pink panther, black panther. Who gives a shit? And I don't remember asking you a God Damn thing, you little turd.
There's no reason to be abusive. You're projecting your anger on me as a defense mechanism.
What the hell is he talking about?
I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
No. How much?
How about Canada?
Going somewhere?
Today's your lucky day, Sami.
Yeah, I can see that.
Normally I'd be breaking your fingers right now, but I'm going to give you a chance to make enough to pay me back and have some extra for yourself. We have a group going to Chicago to do a job. You're going with them.
Me?
You lived there. You know the city.
-- I want to be Elvis.
It's my idea.
C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you do.
We have a problem. Problem isn't the right word. Dilemma. No that really doesn't describe -- Do you know who that is?
Mr. Taylor?
Why would they want us to rob the Mafia?
"Vase with twelve Sunflowers."
You guys used to work together?
It's good.
God, I want to go home.
This is great. After everything we've been through we've got eight hundred euros and an autographed baseball.
The baseball is mine.
Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be angry... but I'm the one who took the ball and that makes it mine.
No.
Give it to me, Sami.
How's my brother?
He's over at St. James. They had to put two pins in his arm.
Who is closer to the wall, Joey or me?
Get in the car.
What happened?
They sort of got away.
Anybody know about that car outside?
Yeah. It's mine.
No. It's mine.
The hell it is.
I'm telling you that's my car! And someone's gonna pay for it!
And I'm tellin' you it ain't! Now, turn your taco-eating ass around and get the hell out of here.
Fuck you, grease-ball!
Mr. Zammito?
Uh huh.
I represent a person who wishes to remain anonymous, but is aware of your current financial problems with your brother.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I understand. The person who sent me wishes to help you.
How?
Yeah.
It's yours. A gift. A gift you could give to your brother... or anyone you owe money to as partial payment.
No shit?
I am Raymond. Thank you for allowing us to stay here.
No problem, man. Hey, you wanna hit?
Oh, Pepe Le Pew. He is very funny and quite well known in France.
Yeah, I dig him.
How are we going to do that?
I would like to thank you for your hospitality. If you are ever in Paris here is my number.
He speaks about himself in the third person?
I'm glad you didn't get something flashy.
I think we went the wrong way.
Holy shit.
How do we know what room she's in?
The money isn't here.
I said knock it off! Now as far as I'm concerned you two girls can bitch slap yourselves silly when this is over, but right now we've got to figure out what's going on.
You're not helping.
I say we make him pay first. After that you can do whatever you want to him.
The new Beaujolais' come out in France next week. You like wine?
I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself.
J&amp;B?
Glenmorangie.
Algeria.
And you don't speak French?
Well, you know, not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really --
You put a loaded gun in your bag and brought it through customs? How stupid is that?
I can't even hear myself think.
They send us to Zammito's house. The FBI is right across the street watching the whole thing, but they don't move. A crime is going down and they don't move. Why? Because they were waiting for us to come out so they could arrest us.
What does arresting us get them?
It has to be at Sophie's. She didn't have time to go anywhere else before she came here.
And how do we do that?
They killed our friend. It's personal now. Besides, if we do that, then Julien died for nothing. The tapes are the key.
I wasn't expecting this many of you. I've got a few sleeping bags you can use.
When do we go?
You ever hear of jet lag?
You like shoes?
No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.
So, how did you get hooked up with these guys?
Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's?
The art world doesn't fully appreciate my talent yet. I needed some way to pay the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay well for information.
So you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed?
Casandra. Old girlfriend?
Something like that.
Did she break your heart?
Something like that.
It looks old. Did you get it a long time ago?
You ask a lot of questions.
That's how you get to know someone. Did it hurt when you got it?
I don't remember. I was drunk.
You got it in a bar?
No. I got it in prison. I went in for three years. When I came out she was married to my best friend. Happy?
Sorry. I didn't mean to pry.
It's okay. It was a long time ago.
Who's gonna see it there?
Can't sleep?
No.
I'm sorry things went so wrong today.
What are you doing?
I thought I'd listen to some of the tapes. See what's so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe.
Sounds boring.
I really thought we had something special going. I can't tell you what a disappointment you've turned out to be.
Who are you waiting for?
Why?
Frankie, I --
Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother!
She seems pleasant enough.
She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
So, I just come by to see how you're doin'?
You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
Yeah. I mean besides that. They treating you all right? Food okay?
Yeah. I'm going home today. What do you want, Frankie?
I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day.
A little?
Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So, I've decided to make it up to you.
You gonna forget about the money I owe you?
What's this?
A car.
Oh really? Thanks. I thought it was a sewing machine. What the hell is it doing here?
It's for you.
For me? What am I going to do with a piece of shit like this?
I don't know. Sell it. It's gotta be worth something. Someone gave it to me. C'mon Frankie, I'm trying to make good here.
Okay. Okay.
You're back!
How's the arm? Still sore?
Much better. You've been gone so long.
Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.
She's crazy. You should have killed her.
I didn't have the heart.
Who are you?
I don't care about your sword.
Why were you spying on the Yus?
I'm looking for someone. Jade Fox. I'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district. Jade Fox is a master criminal. I hear she infiltrated the Yus. She must have come with them when they transferred here. But with Yu's reputation, I can't just go in and accuse her.
This Jade Fox is a woman?
Yes.
Then leave her to me.
Isn't it a bit too late to be out? You've brought me the sword?
Where's your master?
Do you think you are a real master?
Like most things, I am nothing. It's the same for this sword. All of it is simply a state of mind.
Stop talking like a monk! Just fight!
Then tell me where Jade Fox is.
On guard!
Go ahead.
Why should I? You need practice. I can teach you to fight with the Green Destiny, but first you must learn to hold it in stillness.
Why do you want to teach me?
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
And if I use them to kill you?
Who are you? Why is the Green Destiny in your possession?
What's it to you?
My name is Li Mu Bai. The Green Destiny is mine. Jade Fox can't be your master. Where did you learn that "Xuan Piu" move?
I'm just playing around.
Tell me, who is your master?
You're home late... or should I say early?
Why are you still here? You killed a policeman. You should leave! You'll bring ruin on my whole family.
They wouldn't have found me if you hadn't stolen the sword. Like a little girl, you thought stealing would be fun? You, too, are responsible for that death. Come with me. You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat. Denied your talent... As a master and disciple we will rule.
I'll never live as a thief!
You're already a thief.
That was just for fun. How can I leave? Where would I go?
Wherever we want. We'll get rid of anyone in our way. Even your father.
Shut up!
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?
I owe you nothing.
You think you've been teaching me all these years from the manual? You couldn't even decipher the symbols!
I studied the diagrams. But you hid the details!
You wouldn't have understood, even if I had tried to explain. You know... you've gone as far as you can go. I hid my skills so as not to hurt you.
If I hadn't seen you fight with Li Mu Bai, I'd still be ignorant of all you've hidden from me.
Master... I started learning from you in secret when I was 10. You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu. But once I realized I could surpass you, I became so frightened! Everything fell apart. I had no one to guide me, no one to learn from.
Hello. What is your name?
In that case, perhaps we could be of assistance.
Don't bother.
You don't seem to understand.
Are you related to Li Mu Bai?
Please sit.
I've made you silk pajamas. Do you want to change into them?
Put them down.
I heard you met Shu Lien today.
Do you know her?
I'll socialize with whomever I please.
I'm tired now.
Go to bed then. Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon. God knows what the future will bring.
It will be just the same. Enough! I'm tired.
This spells trouble.
It's heavy for such a thin piece of metal!
The handle is heavy. And the blade is no ordinary metal. Still, the sword is the lightest of weapons. You're just not used to handling it.
But I have had much practice. As a child in the West, a platoon lived with us. They'd let me play with their weapons. The scabbard is so beautiful.
Beautiful but dangerous. Once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire. It's 400 years old.
Exquisite! You said it belongs to...
My friend Li Mu Bai. He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.
Li Mu Bai! The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
You're too young to understand.
Yes, I am. But I prefer the machete. Certain moves, however, call for a sword.
It must be exciting to be a fighter, to be totally free!
Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust, integrity... Without rules, we wouldn't survive for long.
I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!
Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
But you're just like the characters in the stories.
Sure. No place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds... They tell you all about that in those books?
You know what I mean. I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.
So I heard. Congratulations. It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?
You're not married, are you?
What do you think?
No! You couldn't roam around freely if you were.
I've missed you.
How so?
You're doing calligraphy?
You write gracefully. Calligraphy is so similar to fencing.
Please.
Thank you for seeing me. I hear your wedding day is near. You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.
I'm hardly doing a thing. The less I think of it the better. My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career.
You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family.
Am I? I wish I were like the heroes in the books I read. Like you and Li Mu Bai. I guess I'm happy to be marrying. But to be free to live my own life, to choose whom I love... That is true happiness.
Do you think so? Let me tell you a story.
About you and Li Mu Bai?
Yes. Did you know I was once engaged to be married?
No, really?
His name was Meng Si Zhao. He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath. One day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy. After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together. Our feelings for each other grew stronger. But how could we dishonor Meng's memory? So the freedom you talk about, I
Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.
I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties.
Don't distance us. From now on, let's be like sisters.
You say she killed a policeman?
Here you must be in proper attire.
I'm just borrowing some clean clothes. I'm not staying.
I'll give them to you.
You, sister...
Look at the trouble you've caused. Now you know what Giang Hu life is really like. If you think of me as your sister, let me give you some sisterly advice. You can run from marriage, but not your parents.
They forced me to marry!
Go back to them first. Then you can decide about Lo.
You know about Lo?
He really loves you. Come back to Peking with me. We'll find a solution.
Where is he now?
Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
You're working together to set me up! I'm leaving!
How dare you accuse us? I always knew you had stolen the sword! I've done nothing but protect you and your family. And you're repaid me with nothing but contempt. Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him. We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all! You're no sister of mine!
Don't touch it! That's Li Mu Bai's sword.
Come and get it if you can.
Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing.
You can't die! Tell us what poison you used! You can't die! Tell us the antidote! You can't let Li Mu Bai die!
Take my horse and go to the compound. Give this to Mrs. Wu. She'll help you. Hurry!
Stop it! You don't deserve the Green Destiny.
Not another lecture! On guard!
Let's end this here.
What do you want?
What I've always wanted, to teach you.
Give it back!
Kneel!
Never!
The antidote exists. She taught it to me. The formula is simple, but it takes time to prepare. Trust me. As you have helped me, let me help you.
Lo?
You shouldn't have come.
Let's stop a moment.
Give it back!
Well, there used to be! What's your name? I'm Lo. The Hans call me Dark Cloud. I'm not that tall or big, but I'm quick as lightning.
You've got quite a temper. It's better this way.
You coward!
No more hitting on the head! All this trouble for a comb?
It's mine. It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
Not true. I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.
I'm sorry... I guessed wrong. I though you were a Han.
Give me back my comb.
I don't take orders from anyone.
When I was a boy, one night, I saw a thousand shooting stars. I thought, where did they all go? I'm an orphan. I used to look for stars alone. I thought if I rode to the other end of the desert, I'd find them. I've been riding in the desert ever since.
Out here, you always fight for survival. You have to be part of a gang to stand a chance. Slowly, your gang becomes your family. All that Dark Cloud stuff is just to scare people and make my life easier.
So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars.
Your father's men are still looking for you. They're still out there, circling closer.
Let them look.
Don't send me back!
Keep it safe. Return it to me when we are together again.
I will.
Go.
Jen...
Do you remember the legend of the young man?
"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
Mu Bai...It's been too long.
It has. How's business?
Good. And how are you?
Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan Mountain. He said you were practicing deep meditation.
Yes.
The mountain must be so peaceful... I envy you. My work keeps me so busy, I hardly get any rest.
I left the training early.
Why? You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.
During my meditation training... I came to a place of deep silence... I was surrounded by light... Time and space disappeared. I had come to a place my master had never told me about.
You were enlightened?
No. I didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment. Instead... I was surrounded by an endless sorrow. I couldn't bear it. I broke off my meditation. I couldn't go on. There was something... pulling me back.
What was it?
Something I can't let go of. You are leaving soon?
We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.
The Green Destiny Sword? You're giving it to Sir Te?
I am. He has always been our greatest protector.
I don't understand. How can you part with it? It has always been with you.
Too many men have died at its edge. It only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade.
You use it justly, you're worthy of it.
It's time for me to leave it behind.
Come with me to Peking. You can give the sword to Sir Te yourself. It'll be just like old times.
First I must visit my master's grave. It's been many years since Jade Fox murdered him. I have yet to avenge his death. And yet I'm thinking of quitting. I must pray for his forgiveness.
Join me once you have finished. I can wait for you in Peking.
Sir Te believes it's a ploy cast suspicion on Governor Yu.
But something is going on at the Yu household.
Jade Fox? Impossible.
You always suspected she'd fled to the West.
I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!
Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?
So I shall avenge my master's death after all.
Be careful. Sir Te requires discretion. Official business is difficult enough. Don't let personal feelings make it worse. And I don't know... even this poster... could be some sort of trap.
No.
It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's. On the night of the theft there was a brawl near Yu's. Were you involved?
It was Bo, Sir Te's man. I hear he followed the thief to the Yus'.
Have you questioned him yet?
No, not yet...
But your men are watching over Yu's compund?
No, I'd already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that I'll get it back soon using my own methods.
That's not what I meant. I don't care about the sword.
What do you mean? Didn't you come back here for it?
I don't know it was stolen until I got here.
Then, why did you come?
I admit, getting it back makes me realize how much I'd missed it.
But it's not your sword anymore. You gave it to Sir Te.
True. But I must borrow it for one last mission. Jade Fox must die at its edge. Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?
My job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone. I wasn't about to ruin her life, or her father's.
You did your job well. But, this girl... I saw her last night.
I knew she would intrigue you.
She needs direction... and training.
She's an aristocrat's daughter. She's not one of us. In any case, it will all be over soon. You'll kill Fox, and she'll marry.
That's not for her. She should come to Wudan and become a disciple.
But Wudan does not accept women.
For her, they might make an exception. If not, I'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon.
It's not our affair. Even if Wudan accepts her, her husband might object.
I thought by giving away the sword, I could escape the Giang Hu world. But the cycle of bloodshed continues.
I wish there were something more I could do to help you.
You think Jade Fox will show up?
Don't you want to see her again.
Shu Lien... The things we touch have no permanence. My master would say... there is nothing we can hold on to in this world. Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real.
Not everything is an illusion. My hand... wasn't that real?
Giang Hu is a world of tigers and dragons, full of corruption... I tried sincerely to give it up but I have brought us only trouble.
To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger.
We're close to your headquarters. Go home and check in.
What about you?
I'll look around and catch up later.
What happened?
Jade Fox drugged her. How did you get here?
My blood will soon reverse its flow. It's the same poison she used to kill my master. There is no antidote.
Mu Bai, hold on. Give me some hope...
Shu Lien...
Save your strength.
My life is departing. I've only one breath left.
Use it to meditate. Free yourself from this world as you have been taught. Let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath. Do not waste it... for me.
Madam Te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts. She's being so considerate.
I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today.
We know who stole the missing item. If the thief returns it, I'm sure Sir Te will pursue the matter no further.
That's good. Sometimes the help can't keep their hands to themselves. It's very embarassing.
Sir Te knows that even well-meaning people can make mistakes... that can bring ruin to themselves and their families.
But don't be too lenient.
No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking.
A murderer?
Yes. The very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master. Last night, she killed a policeman who had tracked her down.
Maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same.
It's Jade Fox!
You're mistaken. We're just street performers. We were rehearsing.
They're gone.
What does it say?
If you surrender now, you'll suffer less. But if you resist, I won't stop until you're dead.
This is Li's personal sword, a great hero's weapon! He is the only one in the world worthy of carrying it. It's too fine a gift. I cannot accept it.
Sir Te! It has brought him as much trouble as glory. Help him to leave these troubles behind. Otherwise, he'll never be able to start anew.
You've always been so good to Li Mu Bai and me. Please accept our thanks.
Please do not be such a stranger. You'll stay the night as my guest. Now, Shu Lien... tell me something. And forgive me for prying. Your father was a great friend to me, and I think of you as my own daughter.
Please, Sir Te, what is it?
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something?
I don't know...
Don't be coy. I've always known about your feelings for each other. All these years, it's a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. You're both wasting precious time.
I beg your pardon. Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.
Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?
Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.
But the sword could be in his compound.
We must be careful. Governor Yu is a court official, and in charge of security. Any disturbance will cast suspicion on him. It might get Sir Te in trouble.
This is a delicate matter.
Sir Te, can you find some excuse to invite Madam Yu and her daughter?
What do you have in mind?
Sure it coulda. Funboy's not here, neither is T-Bird -- none of Top Dollar's number ones.
You know, you sure got a hard-on for a guy that's guilty of zip on paper. Top Dollar runs Showtime; what's the matter, don't you like adult entertainment?
This sack of shit is called Tin- Tin.
Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names?
He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
And you're gonna tell me who.
What in the hell... do you call that?
Talent. Hi.
Care for a hot dog?
You buying?
No onions though, okay?
No onions?
Whatever it is, the answer's no, Eddie. I'm too busy tonight.
Speak up. Clear it with the Captain if you need a file.
Just don't tell me you "owe me one." What file?
Don't thank me. Your ass is already in enough trouble for this shit.
Could be.
Well, hello there...chocolate,
Don't thank me.
And I say I'm dead... and I move.
Are you nuts, walking into a gun?
Listen: Top Dollar. He "owns the street here." He will "erase my ass."
You don't say.
I know Top Dollar has turned your streets into his hell.
Fucking A, my friend.
You, my friend, are dead. I saw your body. You got buried.
You died, man. I can't believe it but here you are. Last year, you and your girlfriend --
I need you to tell me what you remember. What happened to us?
You okay, man? I mean, what just happened.
My name.
I'm sorry as hell, man.
Halloween is coming, soon. You will have Top Dollar if you watch for me at the Showtime, tomorrow night.
Thank you. For giving a damn.
It's done. ALBRECHT I figured as much. Did you cap off Funboy.
Funboy had to leave this mortal coil.
Yeah, among others. Hey, man -- you're hit.
It's only a flesh wound.
I mean, I've done what I came to do. It shouldn't hurt this much. But it will pass...
They couldn't do anything for me.
How 'bout the morgue?
You sorta looked like you might need my help.
This isn't your place. This isn't your fight. And I don't need your help.
You're welcome.
Leave here. Don't do this. I don't want you here.
Don't interfere.
Mom --?
I told you you're not supposed to come in here.
I was wonderin' where you'd gotten to -- Oh, Elly, honey, a cat. Here?
He was a present. Besides, we're moving anyway. You said.
At least it finally stopped raining.
Hey, Darla -- before we die of old age, how about it --?
Oh wow, oh wow, don't fucking do that, man. I nearly had a fucking heart attack.
Fun -- look at that guy...
It's just the dope, don't worry
Fun, he's not going away; he's scaring the piss outta me!
You look like a rock star without a job.
My mom works over there. I'm waiting for her, but she's probably with him, right now.
Who?
Mister Funboy.
Mister Funboy lives there?
I can pick out a tune now and again.
Can you play "Teddy Bears' Picnic?" It used to be her favorite.
Does she have a name?
Do you feel okay.
No.
You gotta go now, I bet.
What's going on...?
You brought flowers. As long as you don't forget her, Elly, she lives.
She's dead. She's gone. And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too. I hate this place; it isn't fair.
I remember him! Here, Gabriel... here kitty... Gabriel... Is he still yours?
Shelly would've wanted you to have it. This way, you'll think of her every time you see it...
Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean.
In a better place. I hope.
I don't know if I can. But you have this... and you know where to come.
What's goin' on, Elly?
I went to see a friend of mine.
Well, how's your friend?
Chili dog for breakfast... it's original.
Mom tried to cook.
I know your friend, too -- the one that looks like a rock star.
I don't know you.
You're not a cop, either. What do you want him for?
I'm looking for a good guitar man.
You buying? He kinda wanders around. You'll see him if you pay attention.
Little early from trick-or-treat, homie. This dick trying to bushwack me.
A year ago. Halloween. A man and a woman. In a loft. You helped to murder them.
Last Halloween, eh? Yeah... Yeah, I remember. I fucked her too, I think.
You cut her. You raped her. You watched!
I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin.
Holy shit... you're dead, man...
Top Dollar, you're the only one here still wasting good air...
Five large, in the drawer right over there. I never saw you.
Do you know what you destroyed?
A year ago. A very nice lady circulated a petition. She died. Last Halloween. Answer yes or no.
That's ancient history.
Who gives a fuck! I'm a businessman. You gonna do me, then do me and shut you're face!
You don't even remember...
I never forget anything, dickhead. That building was a sweep-and- clear; the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition. It got a little rowdy... end of story.
Cute nickname, don't you think?
I ain't got no fuckin' ring.
Top Dollar.
Another jolly nickname?
You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar.
T-Bird?
Like the car. He hangs out with Skank. that little ass-hair, and they hang at the Pit -- hell, Funboy lives there. Ask Top Dollar.
I believe our friend Elly call you Mister Crow. Please acknowledge; the mike will pick you up.
I can see her.
I wish to possess what you have now.
I want the girl. Unharmed. Now.
Sooner or later, my action were destined to bring me a genuine Fury. And it turned out to be you. At last. I appreciate your abilities as few mortals can. That's why I desire them.
You're too late. There was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to. But he turned to dust and blew away. I don't have any power for you to take.
And how many lives have you destroyed?
How the hell did you do that?
Neither.
Owwwaaaa -- fuck me! Look what you did to my sheets, you lame piece'a shit! AAAAaa! Goddd!
Does it hurt?
No, wait, no WAIT, that's too much, man, that's like overkill, nobody can take that much, you're wasting it -- !
What the hell are you?
Having fun yet? No? I'll give you a hint. Remember whatshername?
Shelly?
Miss her?
Yes.
Get it?
Glad to see you're finally with the program.
Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy.
Getting a little ambitious and extracurricular, aren't we?
Go away.
You need to learn to mind your own business or you'll never get where you think you're going.
Shut up.
Your job is done. You interfere with the living again.
Do this thing and you will be vulnerable. The blood will not return. No powers. No reunion. Nothing.
You'll be alone.
Don't waste my time.
Blow yourself, bigmouth.
Coupla more rings... 24k.
18k. Crap.
...necklace... pearls...
Nineteen bucks at Sears. Fake,
What's this -- a little, ah, bloodstain, right? Fifty bucks for the box, and I'm doin' you a --
Did you see an animal of any kind? Did you see a bird?
What... the hell is that?
That thing is poisonous.
Give me a break. That guy's a wacko...
I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is. I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury.
Do you know of spirit assassins? You do know the dead can rise? Properly motivated, of course.
Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
Mmm. But tonight I can take what is his.
Who is only invulnerable so long as he cares about the dead. When he begins to care about the living, you'll find his heart can bleed... and I want it to bleed for me.
We've got company.
I've got him if you want him.
No shooting.
An unexpected pleasure.
Bad news. Alot of action on the streets tonight, and nobody bothered to clear it with me. Tin- Tin got himself whacked.
Who got himself what?
One of mine. And it wasn't a standard hit.
I had heard something like this. Describe it for me. The "hit".
I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
I know of no one. But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?
Anybody violates my turf -- our turf -- I'll rip out there heart and show it to 'em.
Sounds like our "Crow" is out-maneuvering you.
"Our" Crow...?
Come now. You've seen the graffiti -- all over the city in the few hors it has taken your men to drop like plague victims. What about your turf, Top? You don't seem to have ripped out anyone's heart yet.
Do you think this childish machismo impresses me? When I was a boy in Saigon I watched my country change one block at a time, one building at a time. Whole lives erased. A way of life, polluted. Today, no one forces me to move. I use my powers to change your country, one block at a time, one building at a time.
Nice speech. What's it supposed to mean?
I'm Kathryn.
Have we met?
I don't think so.
Did you know Sebastian well?
You might say that.
Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your father's the new headmaster at Oakwood.
That's right.
Are you okay?
I'll be fine.
Thank you.
Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I... turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but -
Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.
Excuse me?
You heard me.
Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect.
Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian.
Sebastian was a pathological liar. I wouldn't believe a word he -
I have his journal.
You what?
His journal. He sent it to me the day before he died. Everything about you is in it. The blow jobs, the hand jobs, the menages, your bout with bulimia, the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you... eww. Let's see, then there's your coke problem... You still keep it in your crucifix, don't you? It's all in there.
You didn't show it to anybody?
Actually, I was planning on running down to Kinkos. Do you think you could give me ride?
You can't do this to me. It could ruin me.
He told you he's failing in love with you? I've never known him to say those words before.
Really? I thought he said it all the time.
Nothing.
Is there a mutual feeling between you two?
No. I mean. I don't know. What else do you know about him?
Not a whole lot. We take some classes together. He's got a bad rep, but it's mostly bullshit.
What do you mean?
Well, a lot of people are jealous cause he's loaded.
I don't know. I've been hearing some awful things about him.
From who?
Annette, how long have we known each other?
Forever.
You promise not to say anything?
On my mother's life.
So what year are you going into?
Junior.
Got a boyfriend back home?
No.
Why not?
I don't know. Relationships seem too distracting. I'd rather concentrate on my studies.
You a lesbo?
Are you often this offensive on a first encounter?
I read your teen beat manifesto.
You did?
I must say I found it rather appalling.
That's a first. Most people praised me for it.
Most people are morons. I mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced?
I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.
Oh really?
Take yourself. You've slept with several women. Are you happier because of it?
How do you know I've been with several women?
A friend wrote me.
Well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip.
Who the hell is taking the time to write letters, spreading this shit about me?
It's not really important.
Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're not going to be friends.
Why are you being so dramatic?
Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm trying to deal with them and the last thing I need is people spreading shit about me.
Excuse me. Excuse me!
You talking to me?
Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read.
What'cha reading?
The Fountainhead.
Great book.
You've read The Fountainhead?
Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act, you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature.
Romantic? He rapes her.
That's a matter of opinion.
You need help.
Why don't you come join me for a swim and we'll discuss it.
At this hour? I don't think so.
Oh come on. Quit acting like a geriatric and get in the pool.
Gee, with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse.
Please.
Give me a minute. I'll be right down.
You know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible.
What? Another letter from your friend?
This is my favorite part. Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.
You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her?
I sincerely doubt it.
The last thing I need is you going into my room searching for this while I'm away.
How's the water?
About what?
About what you said today in the stable. I'm not a happy person.
I never said that.
You implied it.
Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time.
No, it's okay. I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well, YOU seem to be happy in your choices. I envy you. No bullshit.
Thank you.
Seriously, you're amazing. You have everything going for you. You're smart, you're beautiful, you're determined. You're everything I want in a girlfriend.
Shut up.
I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you out.
Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work.
Why not?
Do you deny that there's an attraction between us?
I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends.
I'm sorry, but you're not my type.
You're naked.
That's repulsive.
Need a lift?
No thank you.
How are you today?
Give it up.
Oh right, last night. I guess I owe you an apology.
I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me.
It was fine.
I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night.
I thought we agreed that we were going to be friends.
And that's a bad thing?
I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.
Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you.
You don't even know me.
Don't you believe in love at first sight?
Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual.
Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning?
I can't. I'm seeing a friend.
Who?
That's none of your business.
How about tonight?
I'm busy.
Doing what?
That's also none of your business.
Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I win your heart. I'll do anything. I can't get you out of my mind.
You truly want to do something to make me happy?
Yes.
And you promise to abide by it?
Without question.
Alright. I want you to leave and go back to New York.
What?
I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?
No, not at all.
Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing.
I'm... I'm alright.
How was your date?
Well, I was just calling to tell you I was thinking about you and I miss you. I'll let you go.
Wait, don't hang up.
Okay?
What are you doing?
What are you reading?
Of Human Bondage.
Somerset Maugham.
Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering my situation.
Sure. Have a good night.
Alone again. What are you up to today?
I'm doing some volunteer work.
Need any company?
You? Volunteer? I don't think so.
I don't know? Maybe I'd like it. I'm trying to change here. You could be supportive.
Okay.
It's weird. I actually feel good about myself. Can we do this again next week?
Oh please.
What?
"I actually feel good about myself?"
I do.
You must take me for a real idiot.
I don't.
You're going to tell me that you had a good time with the old lady.
That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad person.
Yes it does.
No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me.
I can't win with you.
It's not about winning. You know what your problem is? You take yourself way too seriously.
I do not.
Lighten up.
I am lighten. Can we drop this?
Oh dear, are you actually laughing?
No.
Am I bothering you?
My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend of Florentino.
Who's Monsieur Philipe?
Bonjour Monsieur Philipe.
You know what? I don't take it back.
Why are you doing this?
Because I'm in love with you.
I thought you said we were going to be friends.
I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... Tell me!
I have feelings for you.
Then what's wrong? I love you Annette. It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus.
That's not fair.
You really want to know?
Yes.
I just came to say goodbye.
Where are you going?
Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.
I think that's for the best.
Good for you.
Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms.
How am I a hypocrite?
Please don't go.
Hi.
I'm fine. I have to get going to my friends' house. Was it --
Hi.
Would you like a tour?
This isn't working out for me anymore.
It's not you, it's me. I'm completely fucked up.
What are you saying?
Why aren't you understanding?
I love you.
Why are you trying to hurt me?
You don't know how to love.
You don't even know me. The fact of the matter is there is some one I love. She's smarter, prettier... you don't even compare to her. The only reason I am here is because she wants us to be exclusive.
But you knew this was important to me.
It's a beautiful home you have here Mrs. Rosemond.
Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been with my family for over sixty years. Does your family do much riding?
My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.
I'm sorry about that.
My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his farm so I would come over and ride all the time.
I'm familiar with a lot of breeders in the mid-west. What's his name?
Ben Schwarz.
Schwarz. Jewish?
German.
Unbelievable. Some fag, no offense -
- none taken -
- wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me.
Any ideas who it could be?
Blaine, if I knew who it was that person wouldn't be alive right now.
Where did you say she's from?
Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?
Greg McConnell.
The football stud?
He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat.
It would make sense. McConnell hates me. I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year.
I don't think that bothered him.
What do you mean?
Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field.
Are you shitting me?
I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak in my dorm room drunk every month. We'd go at it for a while, then as soon as he'd cum, he starts freaking out. You know - "What are you doing, man? I'm not a fag. I'll kick your ass if you say anything." It's like, for Christsakes Greg, you're gay, deal with it. The only
Too bad he's in Kansas this summer.
Not anymore. Football team started practice last week. He's already called me to hook up.
Really. You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf?
Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing Spartacus on television tonight.
Outstanding.
Don't think it's not going to cost you.
I think he's telling the truth Valmont. Greg couldn't write a grocery list let alone a letter.
Oh, I suck. I suck.
Ronald is one of the few high school students attending Juliard. He's composing his first opera.
It's based on the life of Doctor Martin Luther King.
Well, I guess it's getting late. Please thank Kathryn for the use of her Steinway.
I'll see you tomorrow.
What are the boys like?
Where did you find those?
Margarita found them while cleaning your room.
Those are my letters!
I'm in the bath, mom.
Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs. Rosemond's before lunch.
What was that?
I'll call you later and we'll get together and plan your curriculum.
So, rumor has it that you went on a date with Court Reynolds. I hear he's very nice.
He's alright. He kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.
Really? Bulimic headcase.
What a loser she must be. Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
That's great.
You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared.
What are you scared of?
Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to first base with a guy. What do I do?
Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends?
Eww. No. That's gross.
Are you for real?
Do you want to learn or not?
See that wasn't so bad.
It was nothing.
Let's try it again, only this time I'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth. When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours. That's what first base is.
Okay.
That was cool.
Maybe you should try it on your friend Ronald sometime.
What are you saying?
Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you.
That's so romantic. Have you responded?
No.
Well do you like him?
I don't know.
Cecile, we just made out in the middle of Central Park. You can trust me.
Listen to me. Your mother must never know. Never.
Okay.
Did you hide the letters?
Yes. They're in this antique doll house in my room.
I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me.
Why?
Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house.
You'd do that for me?
Of course I would. We're friends, right?
Who is it?
Calm down. Tell me what's wrong.
Something awful happened last night.
What do you mean?!
I... I don't think you want to know.
Cecile, you have to tell me.
It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
Does your mother know?
If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.
Why didn't you do something?
I don't know.
So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you.
Well... not exactly.
He made you give him a blow job.
No.
If that's what you call it.
Cecile, I think you're going to have a hard time crying rape if that's all he did.
What do I do then?
Well did you like it?
Cecile, you had an orgasm.
I did?
I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a woman.
Now listen. Now that you're on your way, it would be stupid of you to stop. Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him instruct you.
I don't love him. I love Ronald.
So? Don't you want to make Ronald a happy pappy? Practice makes perfect, Cecile. My advice is to sleep with as many people as possible.
But that would make me a slut. Wouldn't it?
It's like a secret society.
That's one way of looking at it.
My father just took me on a trip to Australia.
What year are you in?
I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.
But I thought high school is only four years.
Excellent.
You think he'll like it?
What are you doing?
Just taking your photo.
I look terrible.
I'm sorry that was out of line.
I want to go home.
I was just kidding.
Okay, okay. I'll just call your mom and have her come pick you up.
My mom? Don't call my mom.
Please please please. I'll do anything. Just don't call my mom.
Cecile, all I want to do is give you a kiss.
And then I can go home?
Just a kiss, right?
What are you doing?
You promised to let me kiss you.
But -
Want to join me?
Am I suppose to be this sore?
I like it better when I'm on top.
Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet time. This is time when we reflect on what we've done.
You think?
Is it me?
Where are you going?
I'm taking a shower.
Need any company?
No.
Want a blow job?
Good night Cecile.
Jesus. We've been at this for six months.
I know.
And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
But you said you have the worst reputation.
I do.
Don't you want to change that?
Let me tell you something, doctor. Chicks love a guy with a bad rap. They say they don't, but they don't mean it. They all think that they're the ones that are going to "save me." The trick is to let them think it's true.
I think that's all the time we have for today.
Same time next week?
No. This is going to be our last session.
Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer.
This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
You think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. It doesn't work, Sebastian.
It works a little.
No it doesn't. I see right through you.
You do?
I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble.
My daughter, Rachel.
Yummy.
Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.
Really? Care to make a wager on that?
Good luck, Sebastian.
What, nervous I'm going to win?
Hi, mom.
He told me he loved me and I believed him.
Who told you?
Alright honey, just calm down, take a deep breath, and step out of the circle.
Nudie pictures, what do you think?
Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid?
Oh baby... oh baby...
Hey Blaine, did I leave my... holy shit.
Greg, is that you under the covers?
Whoa!
-- really drunk and blah blah blah blah blah.
Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career.
Annette Harrison? I don't know what you're talking about.
Come on Greg. You're the only one who knows her. The truth will save you.
Positive.
Did you do everything I asked you to?
Yes.
You told her I never said I love you before?
Yes!
You told her that people are jealous cause I'm loaded?
Yes!
And you think she bought it?
I'm pretty sure she did.
Pretty sure or sure sure?
She bought it.
Is she with you?
Who is this?
Sebastian, you faggot. Is she with you?
No.
Where is she?!
I don't know. Why don't you leave her alone.
McConnell, I'm gonna out your ass in two seconds if you don't tell me where she is.
I told you I don't know.
One.
Alright. She's staying with some friends of her parents. The O'Sheas. She caught the train twenty minutes ago into Grand Central.
Pleased to meet you.
What do you do? Tell her you love her.
Hello.
Ronald?
Yeah?
Hi Kathryn. Is everything okay?
What's wrong?
It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.
What do you mean?
I think he's high on drugs. He hit me, then took off. I'm afraid to be alone. Please come over.
And when I confronted him about his affair with Cecile he told me it was none of my business. Then when I said "Well what about Ronald," he said you were nothing more than a stupid... the n word and that you deserved what you got...
And this happened before you and I hooked up?
It's been going on for a while. Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.
Racist piece of shit.
I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to.
He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in.
Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and --
Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall.
Do you care to tell me what Mrs. White-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house?
Lovely. How is your gold digging whore of a mother enjoying Bali? Zipping through my inheritance per usual?
Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have a mission for you.
Sorry.
In any event, my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent.
I don't find this very funny,
So that's what this is all about. We'll get together and plan your curriculum.
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. When I get through with her, she'll be the premier Blow Job Queen of the Tri-State area and poor little Court's heart will be shattered.
Why go through Cecile? Why not just attack Court?
Because if there's an attack made on Court it could be traced back to me. I can't allow that to happen. Everybody loves me and I intend to keep it that way.
I see your point... though why should I care?
I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.
Sounds intriguing.
Why not?
Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.
Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?
I'm not interested in the latest dating tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas.
Jesus Christ, is she for real?
Oh yes. I've read it over and over again. This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little angel. A paradigm of chastity and virtue.
B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy.
It just so happens we're not in Kansas anymore. Our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up in Connecticut while Daddy sells his house. Can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? Screwing the new headmaster's virginal daughter before school starts? It will be my greatest victory.
You don't stand a chance. Even this is out of your league.
Care to make a wager on that?
I'll think about it...
Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer?
What are the terms?
If you lose, then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine.
I'll give you something you've been jerking off about ever since our parents got married.
Be more specific.
In English. I'll fuck your brains out.
What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car.
You can put it anywhere.
Even there?
Fuck her yet?
I'm working on it.
Loser.
Blow me.
Call me later.
You would not believe what--
What's wrong with you?
You ready for this? I've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me.
Interesting.
I now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag. Any luck corrupting her daughter?
No.
The plot thickens. It appears that Cecile has fallen for her music teacher.
Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.
Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.
What's your plan of attack?
I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.
I'm at your service.
Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.
I hate when things don't go my way. It makes me so horny.
Moving along quite well.
Have you succeeded in your task?
Any day now.
Who are you calling?
Before we go through with this, I just want you to be aware of the damage we're going to cause.
Are you really? I mean, we've done some pretty fucked up shit in our time but this... I mean, we're destroying an innocent girl. You do realize that.
You amaze me.
I just had a nice chat with Cecile. I don't think she'll be giving you anymore problems.
Yippy.
Who are you spying on?
That her?
Yeah.
Shut up.
What's your problem?
Nothing.
She's really getting to you, isn't she?
If you must know, yes. I don't know what to do. I can't stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, I'm completely infatuated with her. She made me laugh.
And that's why you're losing your bet?
I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.
Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
Morning!
Morning.
So? How'd it go last night?
With who?
If your asking if I nailed her the answer is no.
She shot you down.
Exactly the opposite.
So what went wrong?
I don't know. She was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I was... I just didn't feel right about it.
You're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. God are you a chump.
If you're heading towards her room, you won't find her.
Where is she?
You don't know? She left thirty minutes ago.
Where'd she go?
Bad time?
Kind of.
You didn't?
Oh yes.
Tell me all the details.
It was... Fantastic.
Oh come on. For her first time?
I know. That's the amazing part of it. I mean, it wasn't like Cirque du Soleil acrobatics, just standard missionary stuff, but it was... ah forget it. I'm going to sound like a Hallmark card.
No, tell me.
It was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part.
Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
Some other time.
Excuse me?
I'm not in the mood.
And that's why you're leaving?
It clearly is why.
I want to fuck.
Oh my God. You're completely p-whipped.
No, I'm not.
P-whipped, p-whipped.
I'm sorry. It's just upsetting. You're in love with her. You don't love me anymore.
Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a contest.
At first it was, but now it's become something bigger.
Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you.
Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.
I can't believe you're reacting this way. You're just saying this because you lost the bet.
That's not fair. You're taking all the fun out of it.
Why so nervous?
I've never done this before.
How have you dumped girls in the past?
Screening calls. Any suggestions?
A little melodramatic, don't you think.
I have a flair for drama.
Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?
You wanted an answer to your question.
Devastated beyond repair. I doubt she'll ever trust a man again.
I thought we should celebrate.
I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm expecting some company.
Ronald?
Well done.
To my triumph, of course.
Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her. It's over you.
Come again?
In any event, you still owe me my reward.
Get off me!
Will you calm down?
I'm very sorry about that. I apologize.
I accept. Now get out.
Get out? We had an arrangement.
Didn't you hear what I said?
I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy.
Get out!
I'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed.
And if I don't?
Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three.
I think you have your answer.
I can't tell you how happy we are that Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you this fall. You've always been an inspiration to Beau and I on raising her. We just hope she can rise to the high standards which you've set for her.
You're too kind.
How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. Where do you get your strength?
I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel temptations of peer pressure, I... turn to God and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but it works.
Don't worry, it's totally understandable. Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood are very upstanding gentleman, however there are the occasional bad apples.
I got your message and came as quick as I could.
I hope I didn't keep you from something.
Not at all. What's wrong?
It's Cecile.
What about her?
Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...
Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it?
It's worse. I think there's something going on between Cecile and her music teacher.
Ronald? That's crazy.
I know. She's so young and he's so -
I can't thank you enough.
You will be discreet about this?
Let me get that for you.
Oh please. I can't have you do that.
Who the hell do you think you are?!
Excuse me.
I'm paying you to give cello lessons. Not to pervert my child.
Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.
Got me off the streets? I live on 59th and Park.
First of all, maam, I never touched your daughter and second, I would like to think that in these times someone of your status could look beyond racial lines.
Oh don't give me any of that racist crap. My husband and I gave money to Colin Powell.
Hi. Is Annette at home?
It's desperate that I talk to her.
I've already told you, she's not home.
Well please leave a message that I called.
What do you want?
I need to talk to Annette.
She's not here.
Do you know where she is?
She's out.
Do you know when she'll be back?
Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so -
Annette! Annette!
Young man, I already told you she's not here.
I'll do that.
It's really important.
Did I ever tell you the time when my late husband sent me -
Yes, you already did.
Right after we played backgammon.
We played backgammon?
Uh huh. You beat me three times.
I did?
Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.
I said, do you want some water?
What time is it?
Eight o'clock. You got to go.
Did she show up?
Nope.
Do you mind if I check upstairs?
I can't have you do that, nor can I have you hanging around the lobby all day.
I understand. Thanks for letting me crash here.
Wow. I never knew she had these kind of feelings.
You're a lucky guy.
Ronald, e-mail's for geeks and pedophiles. Be romantic. Write her another letter.
Hey Ronald.
It seems that you and I have some talking to do.
Where the hell do you come off hitting women?
What are you talking about?
Kathryn. Did you hit her?
Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?
Did you hit her?
Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about.
Ronald, I'm sorry.
to a situation) Really, Mr. Reed, there isn't anything to worry about. It was only a slap --
I'm so glad to have met you at last. You're just as nice as Amy told me you were. I hope you'll come to see us.
Oh, hello.
Oliver's pet, I'm sure it would be the first thing he'd grab if we ever had a fire.
But it is a part of our lives too --a part of our past, It's a Goya reproduction. Those three cats -- are supposed to be the most beautifully drawn cats in Western art.
But you don't keep a cat, do you?
We don't even like them, I've often thought of giving it away, but Oliver wouldn't stand for it. It was his first wife's favorite picture. She was an artist.
I didn't know Mr. Reed had been married before.
That the old actress -- Julia Farren?
Yes, She's a little odd, I understand.
Does she go up to the Farren's often?
I love the smell of pine.
It's one of the clearest memories I have. Twelfth night...burning pine... and mummers' plays.
Forgive me, but it was superstition ...foolish, childish wishes...that started, all this.
What do you mean?
It's perfectly normal for a child to dream. I can see how a sensitive little girl, finding this portrait, would take the image of this woman and make of her an imaginary friend. That image dwells only in her imagination, and that image can go as quickly as it was born.
How?
You get your wish!
But Edward, in this kind of a wish that doesn't matter.
What are saying, darling?
I wasn't saying anything. I was singing.
What song, dear?
The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.
Mommy --
Yes, darling.
Did you ever make a wish?
Oh, lots of times.
Did your wishes ever come true?
Sometimes.
Where did you get this ring?
That's what I wished on. Edward says it's a wishing ring -- and it is!
But where did you get it, Amy?
Someone gave it to you? Where was this old house?
On the back street  a green house
The Farren house
Do you know the people?
No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them.
Are they nice?
Well  the mother or daughter -- whichever one gave it to you. You ask Edward to go with you.
I got my wish anyway.
You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
But it's already come true.
Edward will give you your breakfast, Amy.
Where'd you get this, darling?
It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?
She was very pretty.
What's her name?
Irena.
Irena.
Look! Why don't you run out and play? The sun's shining.
Oh, thank you, darling.
Mommy, could Edward take me to Mrs. Farren's house to give her her present?
Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
Well, it shows imagination, anyhow.
I wonder if you don't resent that in her?
I'd hate her to grow up like that.
All I have to do is look at Amy's eyes, blue and deep like yours.
I'm not a jealous woman, Oliver.
I know that.
That's why I can tell you, straight out, you think too much about Irena -- blame yourself for her death. And its your thinking and brooding about her that makes you so unnaturally concerned about Amy.
No. It's not that. It's because I know what can happen when people begin to lie to themselves -- imagine things. I love Amy too much to let her lose herself in a dream world where butterflies become pals. I saw what happened to Irena with her Cat People.
I know, dear. I understand. But try to worry a little less about her -- be a little easier in your thinking. And especially today  let's forget about it. We want a really bang-up birthday party, don't we?
You make me sound like the father in "East Lynne."
Why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile?
Where is everybody?
It's early yet.
It's nearly a quarter after four. The party was for four, wasn't it?
Yes, darling,
Gosh, in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them,
Oilie, that's for the children to play with.
No kids yet. Something's gone wrong. Maybe I ought to call somebody.
All right, Ollie. Go ahead. Call the Boyds...3000W...see if their darling Donald has left.
I think I should. 3000W?
Something's haywire,
What do you mean?
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings. Neither of them received invitations.
My, my, what a coil we're in! What's this all about?
Did you hear the child out?
Well, it seemed to me --
You mean you didn't. It seems to me the least you could do. You can't just jump at conclusions that way. You're being unfair.
I'm never unfair.
You're shouting at me.
What is it, Alice?
Ollie.
What?
It's your play.
I haven't had my breakfast.
Where did you get it?
Some day I'm afraid we're going to have to tell her about Irena.
What's funny?
Oliver, please. Let's not go on with this. The child's trembling.
I thought you were with Amy.
No, she went runnin' off to some old house she was talkin' about yesterday.
That's the Farren house.
Is that where she got the ring, Mrs. Reed? She shouldn't be up there.
But I told her to go with you.
She said something about that, Mrs. Reed  but she didn't tell me it was the Farren house. I'll get my other hat and coat and go over there.
It's late, Mommy -- you haven't forgotten my birthday party.
Your birthday, Amy -- as she goes) -- and I have something for you in my locker. A present.
Hello, Amy.
Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan?
No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
I live right here.
I got lots of presents.
Is that my birthday cake? May I see?
Amy, you remember the party invitations Edward, gave you to mail?
Yes, daddy.
Did you mail then?
Yes, I did.
Where did you mail them?
Amy, not that old tree!
Yes, daddy.
But I told you about that so long ago; you couldn't have been more than three when I told you that tree was a magic mailbox.
I didn't forget.
Amy, make a wish. Wish real hard, and then blow out the candles, and your wish will come true.
But wishes don't come true.
Certain wishes do.
But you told me in the garden-- that the wish about the tree couldn't come true.
What do you want. Amy?
I wanted to talk to you, I wanted to tell you about the other children.
Can't you tell me later?
What do you mean you didn't play with the other children?
It was on account of the birthday party.
Because you didn't ask them? I don't blame them for being angry. Why didn't you explain what happened?
They ran away.
Why didn't you run after them?
Now Amy
It's true.
And who did the voice belong to?
It was just a voice.
Now look, this is the last time you come to me with any such stories  I'm sick of this sort of thing.
Daddy, it's true.
No, I didn't.
I'm sorry. Daddy and Mommy are a little upset.
These are all from me.
Just you wait!
And this one's for Mrs. Farren.
She gave me a ring, so I'm giving her a ring. I paid twenty-five cents for it, too.
Daddy!
Yes, Amy?
Amy, answer me. Why did you call her your friend?
It isn't a secret. She plays with me. She plays with me in the garden all the time. Right out there in the garden, she does!
In the garden? Would she be there now?
She's there, just like I said she'd be.
Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
Amy, there's nothing there. There's no one at all in the garden.
But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree.
Listen, darling. I want you to look once more. Take as long as you want. Look very carefully, and then I want you to tell me that no one's there.
But...
Yes, she was afraid. She said there was someone who wanted to kill me.
But there's no one here, darling.
Daddy?
Yes, darling.
What'd you get for Christmas?
I don't know yet.
My goodness, don't you open your presents until Christmas morning?
No.
We open ours on Christmas Eve. That's considered proper.
Who are you?
You called me by my name.
Irena. But who are you?
I'm your friend.
I've wanted a friend.
I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.
But where do you come from?
You wouldn't understand. I come from great darkness and deep peace
But where is that?
I can not tell you.
Will you be friend for always?
For as long as you'll let me.
I shall want you for always.
For always, then. Only you must promise never to tell anyone about me
Not even Daddy...or Mommy?
No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
You'll always play with me?
Can't you get it, darling?
I'll just never learn arithmetic.
But you must!
The numbers simply don't mean anything
Oh yes they do. Look. One is like a tall princess.
A princess?
Of course. And Two is the prince who kneels before her on one knee.
Yes, yes! I see Prince,
That's right!
This is more fun than just pretend.
There's an oak leaf. Add a maple.
That one's an elm.
light shining) in her eyes) Throw sea weeds into the flames, and the fire turns blue!
But we don't have any sea weed.
No, I don't think that's very much fun. Let's play house instead. You be the friend who comes to see me. I'll show you my children.
Your children?
All right, Amy. Button your sweater, darling. It's turning cold.
Yes, winter's coming. I don't like the winter,
Merry Christmas, Irena. I brought you a present.
Oh, thank you, Amy.
Oh, how beautiful!
It reminded me of you, so I bought it. It cost me more than all the others.
I shall wear it in my hair!
Oh, that is more beautiful than I ever imagined it! I wish I could show you to mommy and daddy. I wish you could enjoy Christmas with us.
You and I shall enjoy Christmas together. Shall I show you my Christmas gift to you?
Merry Christmas.
So beautiful, Irena. So beautiful.
You wanted to share this moment with me.
It stands so still.
Because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind.
I can sea its breath in the cold.
It's a warm breath -- warm and strong  warmed by the sunlight that shone on the deer's back in the hot summer; sweet with leaves and mosses.
May I pet the deer?
It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.
It's you...Irena...my friend!
Don't cry, Amy.
You mustn't be afraid.
But she's dead!
Amy, listen to me. Death isn't such a terrible thing.
Oh, it is, it is! Death's terrible.
You?
Yes, Amy.
But why?
Getting the yard all fixed up for your party, Amy. You'd better hurry and get yourself fixed up too.
Look at my ring.
That's a fine-looking ring.
A lady threw it to me.
Most surely that was a nice lady to give a ring to a little girl.
It's a pretty ring.
A ring that I can wish on like I wished on the candles?
Maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish.
the ring up to him) What's a mourning ring?
They're given to the living in memory of the dead. If this is a real one -- I can't be sure -- you can make a wish, and it will come true in the twinkling of an eye.
Well, if it's a real mourning ring,. I'm going to think hard for something I want more than anything else in the world before I wish.
Been crying? That won't please your Daddy. You'd bettor cheer yourself up.
I'm trying to.
I wasn't singing to myself.
Little miss, you're stopping me in my work.
But I want to talk to you. Mommy says for you to come up to the old house with me. I've got to take back this ring.
You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships for your Dad.
Will you come soon?
You're going to be busy all day long, Edward.
I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
About time for you to come home, Amy.
Little miss, don't you never come here alone. You gave me a fright, you did.
But she's such a nice lady.
There was a deer on the other side of the fence.
Mustn't look, little miss. Mustn't look.
Bad luck to see death in the snow.
But what happened to the little deer?
Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.
Why is it just lying there? Why doesn't it get up?
Because it can't. It's dead.
But it was alive  it was fast and strong!
It got hit.
I've been watching you. You couldn't see me, but I could see you. It was like peeking through a slit in the curtain before the play began. You would be a very good audience. I can see that.
If you were the lady who gave me a ring, my mother says I have to give it back to you.
But my mother says I mustn't accept gifts from strangers.
Stranger? Julia Farren a stranger. Why I've played every theatre from Boston to San Francisco. I've been to London and Paris. Those days  those beautiful, shilling, golden days.
But I only came to give back the ring.
She's always spying on me. She creeps into the room. She lives upstairs, yet she's always watching me  always!
Who is she?
There you are. Take some cake, why don't you?
No, thank you.
I like stories.
Then I'll tell you a story  a lovely story. Do you know the story of Rapunzel?
Mommy read it to ne.
The Headless Horseman --
Why hasn't he got a head?
He'll let me stay, Mrs. Farren. He'll let me stay.
I brought you a present. Merry Christmas.
What?
Who's Herne the Huntsman?
And does he kill people?
Hide me? Why?
Hurry, hurry.
Hurry!
My daughter, Barbara, died when she was six. That was long ago. You're only the woman who keeps care of me. I know you.
You didn't even open my present and I'm your daughter.
I hate the storm. I hate it!
The storms have done everything they can to me, I don't hate them. I don't even hear the wind. It blows beyond me. It was on such a night as this that Barbara died.
But I am Barbara. I didn't die.
Oh, doesn't that prove something to you? Doesn't it?
Look at me. Look at me, mother darling. Look into my eyes. What color eyes did Barbara have?
Gray. They were a lovely, lovely gray.
And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
Yes...yes, that's true.
And my hair...what color hair did Barbara have?
Mother! You called me by name!
Promise me you won't forget tomorrow. You'll remember, won't you? You won't say that it was just a dream. Promise me.
There's another promise you must make me. That little girl who comes here...she mustn't ever come to see you again. Promise me you won't see her.
I-shan't see her. No, Barbara, no.
If that child comes here...if I find her trying to steal your love from me...I'll kill her. Yes, I'll kill her:
Good night, mother, good night.
Let the child stay.
On the dark nights  on the stormy nights -- you can hear him. He passes like the wind; The flapping and fluttering of his great cloak beating like gaunt wings. The thunder of his horse's hooves is loud, loud and louder, beating hard, beating strong on the frozen ground as he comes riding, riding, riding.
...At the hour of midnight, down the road that goes through Sleepy Hollow, across the bridge, he goes galloping, galloping, always searching, always seeking
There's a present you haven't opened yet, ma'am.
It's some animal hurt in the woods that made that sound.
What is it, ma'am?
It's dark. We'd better be getting on. The family will be waiting.
Everything all right down there at the school, Mr. Reed?
Yes, everything's all right, Edward.
When I first heard all that talk about you going down to the school to see the teacher I got really afeard. I thought maybe you night call off this birthday party -- and me with the cake already in the oven.
I thought we were going to save those leaves you were burning for the compost bin.
You won't have long to wait. In just a few minutes this house will be overflowing with boys and girls. Off with you now, Amy. Go out and watch from the gate for all the children who'll be coming.
Well, ma'am, the truth is, I gave them to Amy hersolf to post.
And Amy mailed them?
Amy looks happy  seems almost as if she were playing with another child; like somebody else were running with her and playing.
I like to see her happy.
I didn't even have to coax her tonight.
That's because she made a promise, and she'a keeping it, aren't you, darling. You saw the way she played this afternoon, Edward.
"To Daddy from Amy." Here's one for Miss Callahan. This one says, "To Edward from Amy.".
I know it may seem stupid of me--but it isn't the slap I'm worried about -- it's the reason.
Something to do with a butterfly-- they were quarreling about it.
No. Amy slapped Donald because he had hurt the butterfly -- and it was her friend.
Well, that seems a harmless fancy --
You'd better hurry. I've left Amy in the car and she's getting impatient. She tells me there's something especially important about a sixth birthday.
She refuses to deny it. She continues to believe in her lies.
But don't you see...it's just what I was about to say to Alice...Amy in her own mind may not be lying.
But there was nothing, no one in the garden.
But we have. She's wanted for nothing.
It all starts with them going to the bathroom together.
That many women in one place -- nothing good can come from that.
Sorry about Frida. She's been friends with Jen forever.
I'm lucky Jen's not like that.
I don't believe in PMS. Women made it up just so they can be bitchy.
My brother has an answer to PMS. A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's gotta get it elsewhere.
Waiter! She needs more water.
No way is that the same chick. The other one was a dog.
Jennifer gave her a make-over.
Guess you like those Coyote Ugly steaks now, huh?
Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving.
No one I've run into knows what "coyote ugly" means.
Maybe that bartender made it up. I mean I think coyotes are rather beautiful. Maybe "coyote ugly" is really a compliment. Like someone who's conventionally "ugly" but is really beautiful.
Sorry I didn't recognize you earlier. You look so different.
You shouldn't smoke. It'll kill you.
Yeah yeah I know. Smoking kills. I'll quit someday. Doesn't it seem like all the cool people smoke?
No.
James Dean, Humphrey Bogart...
Yul Brynner. They're all dead.
What?
Wow your body's really hot.
I've been working out.
I mean body temperature. Do you have a fever?
A bite... Where'd you get bitten?
There was a sale.
I mean where on your body?
A dog at Victoria's Secret?
How's the rest of your health?
PMS. What symptoms are you experiencing?
It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
That's just part of being a woman. Diet and exercise should help. Avoid salt, sugar, starches, caffeine, alcohol...
What else is there?
And keep a journal of your symptoms to make sure it's related to your period and not just in your head.
That bite healed up quickly. It's been about three weeks?
Nearly four.
How have you been feeling?
Okay, but I'm worried about the next PMS bout. It's gotten worse. I'm not myself during it. I get bloated, irritable, my breasts get huge, my nails turn into claws, my teeth get sharper and I have more facial and body hair.
Sounds all stress related. Your teeth may feel sharper if you're grinding them at night. You don't seem hairy to me. Is that all?
I get crazy dreams and I black out.
Diet and exercise, that's all there is. I'm not a big proponent of the PMS craze, but there's a book my wife mentioned called "The PMS Diet," which may be helpful.
Does she have PMS?
Jennifer?
No it's mom.
We're worried about you. "60 Minutes" was on same-sex couples.
What does that have to do with me?
You haven't mentioned dating anyone since Mark and, well you're not a lesbian are you?
No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.
I have cramps. I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
Come on, we've been double dating since the fourth grade.
Yeah even then look what happened: Michael Mortenson kissed you and Billy Sullivan threw a worm at me.
Well that's not going to happen tonight. George said Carlton's a nice guy.
Translation: a total geek.
Anything's better than Mark.
My shrink says he's not so bad.
Your shrink always gives you bad advice. He only hears what you choose to tell him. Mark's an asshole, he cheated, he borrowed money and never paid it back, he's never had a regular job.
He's a very talented musician.
Every woman at some point has to date a musician. I wish you'd get rid of Mark for good. Every time you break up you see him more than when you were going out.
I guess I have a weakness for him. It's those big brown Bambi eyes.
I wonder what it's like being you. Being noticed all the time.
He hasn't said one word to me.
Maybe he's just shy.
My date always pays more attention to you than to me.
Frida, I don't mean this as a criticism, but you might not want to talk about PMS around men.
Sorry. It's just so bad lately. You're so lucky you never get PMS.
I get a little bloated sometimes.
How about I give you a make-over? You'll feel better about yourself. You're actually pretty, you're just not bringing it out.
Do you really need these?
Only to see.
Can't you get contacts?
No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.
Or if there's a full moon.
Okay, just one more stop and you'll be all set. Victoria's Secret.
What do I need overpriced fancy underwear for? Shouldn't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie?
It's not about him seeing you in it. It's how you feel. You'll feel sexy in lingerie and it'll show. It's an inner thing.
I don't know.
Where are all the mediums?
Can you believe she fuckin' bit me?
And she got the medium.
I think she broke the skin.
What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room.
George bit you?
Why did Gregory ask me out? I mean he's cute -- he probably just wants to pitch his screenplay idea.
Maybe he likes you, ever think of that? It's good for you to go out -- get your mind off Mark.
You're so lucky you have George and don't need to go on dates anymore.
What I really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment. "Can I use your phone?" "How about a nightcap?" "I want to meet your cat." And my all-time favorite, the old standby, "I have to use your bathroom."
Maybe they have to pee.
Are you kidding? He might as well say, "Can I date rape you?"
I never thought of it like that. I never know what to do on dates. Do guys still pay?
Where?
Where? Where do you think a mustache would be. Look!
I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
Holy shit, I'm a freak.
Hey, did you get contacts?
He's dead? Am I bad luck or what?
There you go, blaming yourself for everything again.
And he was ripped limb from limb?
I'm sure they were exaggerating.
Why would they exaggerate?
So did you do it?
Did I kill him? Of course not!
No, did you fuck him?
No. I don't think so.
You don't think so? You either did or your didn't.
I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.
Did you get smashed or what? You have to eat if you're drinking. And not just those little salads.
I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory.
I guess you're off that vegetarian kick you've been on for ten years.
I couldn't stop eating steak. I felt out of control -- like I was making up for all those years being a vegetarian. I couldn't get enough. And then Gregory walked me home... and he peed in front of me.
What? Why the hell did he do that?
He was trying to get into my apartment and... I know this sounds gross but I was so turned on. I grabbed him and kissed him!
And then?
I think I went in and fell asleep. I guess Gregory walked home and got killed! I blacked out.
At least your PMS is over.
I thought you were going to stop wearing your glasses.
Are those Mark's?
No, Mark wears boxers. They must have been in the dryer already.
He was cute, huh? Of course whenever I meet a guy, I'm wearing no make-up.
Rule one: always wear make-up.
I wonder if he's married.
Gross, so this is Mark's flesh? When did you see him?
Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
Why didn't you tell me? You said you hadn't seen him for a month.
I'm sorry. I didn't want you to think I was still a doormat.
I don't think I've ever actually liked anyone I've dated before. Peter even likes me without makeup.
Hmmm. Sounds suspicious.
I don't know much about him. How do you know if a guy is decent?
Give him the tampon test.
What the hell is the tampon test?
I'm freaking out. I'm like an animal and totally out of control. My arms keep getting really hairy.
You have to stop being so self- critical Frida.
How'd it go with the cop?
We almost slept together... and... then the hair started and I booked.
Frida, this hair thing is all in your head. You're using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone.
It's just as well. I'm afraid of getting hurt again. Mark seemed great at first too. I don't want to get too attached to Peter and then find out he's a creep.
No he didn't. Come on, I don't want to be alone with those two. All they talk about is basketball and it bores the hell out of me.
Okay. I guess so.
I started out on that eye-of-newt diet the doctor gave me and wound up in the tub covered in chocolate.
Well whatever it was, seems to have worked cause you look great.
What did he say?
I think he called you beautiful.
Charming Carlton.
Bag means condom now? I can't keep up with the word "bag." It used to be "No, that's not my bag" -- meaning not my thing. But now "my bag" means "my fault."
You might want to tape your nipples down next time. It's really distracting.
I can't help it. My bra wouldn't even fit. I've been going to Victoria's Secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still I'm busting out. It's this PMS.
Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
Oh my god, look. My arms are so hairy!
Yes they are! Look how much more hair I have than you!
It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that.
Frida, this is a bad time. We're having sex and George actually answered the phone.
Jennifer. A severed arm. It's bloody and... I'm not sure but it may be Carlton's.
You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you.
Please come over. I'm begging you. What should I do with the arm? Should I call the cops or... Peter?
So where's this infamous arm now?
I put it down the garbage disposal.
And what makes you think you killed a man?
You're a PMS werewolf. Of course. Frida, are you on drugs?
You're delusional. Maybe you had a bad dream and bit your lip -- so you tasted blood. And the severed arm... well I don't see it and... maybe this is all in your head.
It took me an hour to clean it up. That was not in my head!
Maybe the blood was from your period like before.
I haven't gotten it yet.
Frida, listen to yourself. If I said I was a werewolf, would you believe me?
Hello?
Frida? I was worried to death about you. I've called you for two days. Where have you been?
I've been here. What day is it?
Tuesday. Are you okay?
Shit, I guess I missed work.
Frida, Carlton's dead.
Oh no.
And he was missing an arm.
Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to confession.
Get rid of him!
Okay, I gotta go.
Holy shit, I don't know.
Did you get rid of Mark?
I don't know... I'm spaced out... he was taking a shower... He must be still in there.
He's been here all night?
What happened to his tooth?
I should call the police. Oh no Peter. Peter is the police!
DON'T call the police.
Why not? There's been a murder.
First of all, you're my alibi. I told George I was with you last night.
What? Why'd you do that?
There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.
How could I? I'm helping you clean up Mark's remains and you ask how could I cheat on George?
You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.
You say murder, but you have no idea what happened. You don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control.
I think I turned into a werewolf and killed him.
Why the fuck would you do that?
I could smell another woman on him.
