And if she asks what it's about, don't tell her. She's opposed to my career.
Uh-huh. Well, Miss Moran, what is it you'd like to do for us?
Candy Man.' Is that all right?
Uh... he knows it.
Oh, sorry. I get so caught up in it sometimes. It's scary.
Yes, it is.
This where the auditions are?
This is where the auditions were.
What do you mean?
We're finished.
You're an hour and a half late.
My watch is broken, too.
This is show business?
Look, miss. We're tired, you have gum on your lip, and we're going home.
Just like that, huh? You're not even gonna give me a chance?
Don't take it personally.
How should I take it?
I don't believe it. I come all the way down down here, break a heel, and you're not gonna give me a chance because I have gum on my lip and I'm a few minutes late.
You're an hour and a half late.
So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?
We ran long.
So run a little longer.
Miss --
Terrific. Thirty-eight.
Susie. Susie Diamond.
I'm sorry to interrupt, but when I saw you sitting here, I just had to come over. Florence Simmons.
Hey, it's legit. Strictly dinner and dance.
Okay. I think that's all we need to know.
I sing now?
So?
When?
When we know.
Ready?
What's the problem?
I mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right?
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
What I mean is --
We're a team. We work together.
Christ, look at her. You'd think if she was gonna wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense to come in the back. Good evening, Miss Diamond. You're late.
Where's my name?
What-?
And how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster?
We'll talk about it later. Right now, you gotta get changed.
Changed?
Where's your dress?
What's he talking about?
Is there a language problem here? Your dress. For tonight. Where is it?
Do I look like I'm naked?
That! You can't wear that!
What's wrong with it?
It's orange!
Come on.
Hey!
Come on. We don't have much time.
If you ask me, this is pretty stupid.
Just look. What do you wear? A nine?
A seven.
My wife wears a seven. You don't look like a seven to me.
I wear a seven.
Okay, okay. Here, how about this?
Save it for your wife.
Hey, pal. I don't know about you, but where I come from there's a little girl's room and a little boy's room and the little boys don't go where the little girls go.
All right, but make it quick. Shoes! What size do you wear?
Nine.
Nine?
Nine!
What do you think?
Uh... good.
Shoes?
They're tight.
They're nines.
Well, they're aspiring to be sevens.
You can buy new ones tomorrow.
Oh, thanks.
Don't worry. We'll take it out of your share.
We need scissors over here! Who's got scissors? Okay, remember. Jack and I go on first, I do the set-up, then introduce you. And you say ...
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here. It's like a dream come true. And speaking of dreams ...
Right.
The switch. Hit the switch.
Fucking. She says fucking in front of an entire room of people.
I said I was sorry.
Fucking.
For Christ sake, I said it, I didn't do it. Besides, I don't think they were too offended, do you?
Give me that.
Hey!
We are not a saloon act. We do not take tips from dirty old men.
I was gonna split it with you guys.
Jack, you with us?
I guess it's,the Plaza then. That brings us to the twenty-seventh. We got the Avedon for three or the Park downtown for two.
By the way, I got a messsage yesterday from some guy looking for New Year's action. Resort, upstate.
Maybe it's legit.
Uh, well ... we flipped a coin.
Well, well. Ho, ho, ho. You moonlighting at Macy's, Frank?
You two could play checkers.
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
You play all these places?
Baker's unabridged.
Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise. What's with the stars?
Virgins.
Virgins?
He's right.
Go ahead.
Okay.The Fantasy Inn.
I don't believe it.
And how about this air? I'm telling you, a few days in this place'll put five years on your life.
Smells like fish.
Of course it smells like fish. We're on the ocean. What'd you expect, Chanel number five?
Smells like tuna number two to me.
Hey, we're connected.
Great.
Great?
You're kidding me.
As Charlie Steinway is my witness.
Peggy Lee?
What'd she sing?
People.' You think Streisand, right? Hot that night. Chills. Through the whole audience. I could hardly play.
Wow. You ever see her again?
Hey, will you look at that?
They must've bought the same map we did.
What do you say we send a bottle over?
Oh yeah?
What's with you two?
Uh, well, I love you, too, Jack. So. Susie. How 'bout it.
Huh?
Got another song for us?
Oh. Yeah. I gotta bunch of them.
What's with you guys?
Forget your tie, handsome ... Frank!
You want to tell me what the hell's going on?
Huh?
I just saw a man walk out of your room.
Uh ...
In case you've forgotten, we're being paid to be here. So it might be nice if you conducted yourself with a certain amount of decency.
Decency? Hey listen, pal ...
Some discussion.
I guess I ... If I jumped to...
How about you? Got a Bar Mitzvah this weekend?
Huh?
I can't sing it anymore.
What?
That song. I can't sing it anymore. I'm gonna get sick.
What're you talking about? They love it.
I'm gonna throw up, Frank. I mean it. Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?
Susie. It's one more show. One more time. That's all.
Good morning, gentlemen. I'm Mr. Daniels, the manager. I believe I've spoken to one of you on the phone.
Tom here tells me there's a problem with the pianos. We were assured they were in tune.
Yes, well, they are.
Then I'm afraid I don't understand.
They are in tune. But not with each other.
Is that important?
Terrific, boys. Really. Terrific.
Thanks, Lloyd.
Yes, sir. You're just what we needed on a night like this.
Uh ... You don't know when you'll be wanting us back, do you, Lloyd?
I'll call you.
Uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I thought maybe...
Yes, sir. That's quite a girl you boys latched onto. She a local?
Born and bred.
Lucky for you. Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?
Whatcha doin' over there?
Gotta go.
How come?
Funny hours.
Funny job.
Brought it.
Shit, thank God. You look like a creep.
Thanks.
No.
Don't worry about it.
Barker. Jock Barker?
Baker. Jack Baker.
Right. Bring him back.
You should've brought a leash, Mr. Barker. The doctor doesn't like to be bitten.
He doesn't bite.
They never do, Mr. Barker.
Baker.
No, I, uh, left a dog here this morning. He needed some work on his mouth.
Regular hours are eight to five.
Yeah, yeah, I know. I was just passing by. Thought I'd check in on him.
You can check in on him tomorrow. Between eight and five.
You want to know if he's okay. Right?
Yeah.
All right. Hold on.
The name's Baker --
Save it. What's he look like?
Black. Labrador.
Well, now, where's everyone run off to? Frank?
No.
It went well tonight.
Frank works hard.
And you don't?
He leads, I follow.
Is that the way it is?
Pretty much.
He mentioned you had a girl for a while. A singer.
For a while. She left.
Yes, well, it's probably best. No sense bringing someone else in.
You miss him, don't you?
It's been a long time, Ma.
Hey, he's not sore, is he?
You never sang before?
Fucking.
The Park? It's only two nights. Why throw away a night?
Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.
Where's egghead?
His kid's sick.
He takes after our mother.
Uh-uh. I never touch American cigarettes. What's tomorrow again?
The Stratford.
Nice place. Fulla velvet. Even the bedspreads. Damn! Two-fifty a pack and I go through 'em like toothpicks. Twelve-and-a-half cents a piece, you believe that?
Huh?
Mmm. Like kissing a rose. Well, au revoir.
Hey. You feel like a cup of coffee?
You kidding? We must've killed three pots in there. Anyway, I gotta get home. Rest the pipes.
No. Thanks. She starts to move away, then stops and looks back.
Hey, listen. You're not going soft on me, are you? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like I'm some kinda princess when I burp.
Forget it.
I mean, that'd be too creepy. With us working together and all.
Forget it.
He do that every year?
Every year.
Aren't the kids asleep?
Every year.
So why's he do it?
Oh, sorry. With the light always on, it's hard to tell.
It's okay. Last one.
Can't sleep?
In and out.
It's the waves. God's music, my mother used to say. She was crazy for the ocean.
Yeah, well, I wish God would go a little easy on the trumpets.
How's egghead?
Like a baby. You?
If you want, I got a pack in the room.
Yeah, well, thanks for sticking your head in.
It wasn't business. It was pleasure.
Relax. We'll drop the song.
Guess I got a little scattered.
How do you do it? Every night?
I can keep the beat.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
What'd I say?
Nothing.
You're upset.
I'm not upset.
All I said was you were good.
Look. You don't know good. All right?
What's that supposed to mean?
It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.
You were good.
Let's make a deal. You shut up.
You were good.
How do you know?
Nina?
Who's Nina?
Friend.
Friend? What's she look like? Maybe I can help you find her.
She's four feet tall. Ed?
I have to make him some chili. Okay?
Like diamonds, huh? I never get over it. When I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into-a necklace for myself. She'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes, I don't know,
You know, I saw you guys once. You and Frank. At the Roosevelt.
Must've been a cheap date.
Soap convention.
Soap?
History.
Huh?
My father proposed to my mother in there.
The both of them? In there?
He called her.
Oh. So what's it doing here?
Long story.
They'd been out dancing all night and he took her to the train station -- she lived over in Brookhaven. Usually held ride with her, but this time he didn't. Anyway, he starts walking home, only as he's walking he starts getting nervous.
Nervous?
By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition.
You're kidding.
He had a mind that escalated things.
So, what happened?
I don't know. Maybe he thought some rich guy was gonna try and call her.
Wow. But I still don't see how ...
Ma didn't want it around. After.
Frank said ---
Oh. Hi. Sorry.
Coffee?
Yeah... No.
Look, if you want to leave...
Shit. I think I started a fire.
You can always get another girl.
Saw the sign outside. Got your own sign, huh?
Yeah. Got my own sign.
So ... ?
We outgrew each other.
Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't figure. You two.
You don't pick your brother.
Yeah.
So how's the cat food business?
What kind?
Huh?
Vegetables.
Listen... you want to get a drink? I got a new place. Or we could go to a bar ... Well, maybe not a bar. But I know a place uptown, if you want --
Tell egghead I said hi. If you see him.
Jack.
Hi.
Let me get the light.
Sneak out in the morning. Before the guy could wake up and ruin it. Never figured I'd be on the other end of it, though.
I didn't want to wake you.
Yeah.
Thanks. For letting me in last night.
Ah, you know. Howsa pooch?
Losing his teeth.
No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox. I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust the taps.
Yeah. The big boys sent it down yesterday.
Another five years, huh?
Like clockwork. You got a good memory, Jackie.
It ain't always a blessing. My brother here?
Did you break a cup, Jack?
Guess they're up.
Sounds big. What's he do?
Process server. Ma said it's like a lawyer only the hours are more regular. All I know's he came to take the TV one afternoon and ended up staying for dinner. And breakfast.
What happened to the donut king?
In the old days, every man had a shaving mug that he kept at the barber shop. Then, whenever he wanted a shave, held go down to the barber shop and there would be his mug, waiting for him.
Is that what you used to do?
My days are not the old days, genius.
What are they?
The recent past.
Oh. Bigfoot gets his out of a can.
How do you know?
I saw his stuff in the bathroom.
Oh?
I guess it's getting serious.
Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.
Ivory.
Looks old.
Older than me.
Hey, what do you want to do? Grow a beard?
Why not?
Well, let's get your first prom under the belt, okay?
What's a prom?
I tried Cheerios this morning. He didn't even get up. Maybe they took out the wrong teeth.
How'd the show go?
Okay. How'd yours go?
From Hurley's?
Jack.
Yeah?
Merry Christmas, Jack.
There were more flowers last year. Mr. Rinaldi down at the drugstore says it's going to snow by New Year's. Says he can feel it in his elbows. I hope it snows. I want to make a snowman. You ever make a snowman, Jack?
Sure.
John. It's good to see you.
So. How are you?
Fine. You?
Big piece or little?
Huh? Oh, no.
None?
How's that dog of yours? What was his name?
Eddie.
Yes. Right. Eddie. How is he?
Waxy Wright. Didn't Jon Archer bust you for poisoning five members of the Canadian parliament?
Do I look wasted -- asshole?
Don't they ever let us take these boots off?
Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
You mean if I get sick?
What did he do?
Fine work, Jon.
Yeah, real fine. Especially all the casualties.
I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say "thanks"?
... Thanks.
Try to kiss my butt just once before I'm transferred.
He's lying.
Jon, he's hooked up to a full-spectrum polygraph. No one has ever beaten --
I don't care -- he's manipulating it. That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere.
Uh-oh, somebody's in trouble.
Jesus Christ, Castor.
Drive.
Where am I?
My place.
You shouldn't have brought me here ... it's dangerous.
I hear you're a manicurist now -- got your own business and everything. I'm glad you've stayed clean.
Like I had a choice with that anal-retentive Jon Archer rising my ass at the probation hearing. At least he took an interest. You took off without leaving so much as a Post-it.
Perfect fit.
Nice-looking kid.
Go on, Adam ... I'm not asking you for anything -- I was never even going to tell you. But hell, I never thought I'd see you again, either.
How old is he?
Yes ... someone might want to tear him apart -- snuff him out -- for revenge.
And this thing can grow it?
Yes. Pollux bought one along with the original batch. Obviously, he found a way to make more.
Why would he need more?
He's your brother, you figure it out. Maybe he made another bomb.
Or reactivated the first one.
Hey, bro ...
You're not my brother. The brother I knew would never have been caught by that dumb fuck Archer. At least tell me the bomb is still going off.
Pollux ...
So?
What do you mean?
I was in a coma, Pollux. I still feel like shit.
Do you know what it is to be in a coma? It fucks up everything -- including your memory! I can't even tell you why Dobbs jumped me yesterday!
You porked his wife the day he was arrested. How could you forget that?
I don't know. Everything's jumbled -- so you're going to have to help me fill in a few blanks.
A few blanks? Like what?
Oh, God -- Mom OD'd at County General.
Uh -- to kill the doctors?
After that. You promised you'd always take care of me.
And I bet I've kept that promise ...
That's not the worst part.
What's worse than losing five million bucks?
Thanks, Pollux.
For what?
For being one helluva guy.
Well, you tried. You failed miserably, but you tried.
Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
She's only 12. Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying "I love you."
Is that what you think?
Jon ... we just remember how it used to be. You staying for a while or is this just a piss-stop?
We need to talk.
I'm late for surgery.
It's important.
... I was dreaming ...
Something good?
We were back in high school. You wanted to join the sky diving team, but I wouldn't let you.
Must've been after we got engaged.
Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother.
So you had a nightmare.
Totally -- you were being very, very bad. You went up in the plane and jumped out. You had a parachute, but it didn't open.
Were you there to catch me?
No.
How come?
Five years ... I still can't get it out of my head -- an inch to the left, Matty would still be alive.
What are you saying? Oh, God -- you're going on assignment again ...
One last time. It's important ...
You said you'd be here! You promised me -- you promised Jamie! What could be more important than that?
I can't tell you ... except only I can do it.
Is someone there?
Who is this?
Never mind that! Just take Jamie and get out of that house. Don't tell anyone where you're going -- especially not him -- just GO.
Okay, you're having an emotional crisis. You need to seek the help of a trained --
Think about it, Eve! Everything he's done recently has been peculiar, right? He's said and done things your husband would never do ...
Whoever you are, don't call again.
I know you -- you're the one who called. You're Castor Troy. You killed my son --
How did he expect to do that?
I took it from my fake husband.
Why point it at me? I'm the real thing.
I don't know that. Maybe Jon's already dead.
What more proof do you need?
Christ, Jon! How could you do this to yourself? How could you do this to us? Do you know -- do you know what he did to me ...?
He freaked out when he thought I had seen this stuff. I think it's a list of cities -- Santiago, Ho Chi Minh City, Nandi ...
Our Pacific Rim stations. These numbers must be bounties. Castor's not wasting any time.
What do you mean?
He's going to kill off our bureau chiefs -- one-by-one.
You can't go. You can't be anywhere near that place.
Jon, what is it?
The bomb. He's reactivated it. And everyone there is going to die.
Can't we call someone? Admiral Lazarro?
I know Lazarro -- the first person she'd call is "me." We can't take the chance of tipping Castor off.
Jon, if I'm not there, he will be tipped off. I'll get rid of Jamie -- but you and I are in this together.
How is he?
No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
I started wondering -- if you couldn't switch back -- would it make a difference?
Would it?
How's Loomis?
Apparently, fine. He's coming into work. That's the good news ...
Go on.
We can send in a plant -- try to get Pollux to spill the location.
Which ear was it?
Jon, this is goddam insane. You can't go through with it. What about Eve?
She doesn't know -- and she never will.
You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24-hour hard-on. He's nothing like you.
Don't worry. I've done my homework. I'll get Pollux to talk.
Now what?
This is it, Jon. For the next 72 hours -- you're on your own.
How is the "date night" idea going over with Eve?
Like gangbusters, doc. Okay, I missed the last one.
You missed the last three, including her birthday. Your wife's gripe sheet.
I've been working night and day. I haven't had time.
One of my informants spotted him -- right here in the city.
I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.
I'm not hiding in my work, if that's what you're saying.
Jon, I'm getting a little annoyed by your obsessive need to spoil my fun.
What's it to you? I declare it. Here I am, back in the States for less than a month --
You're under arrest. Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent --
What're you gonna do with me gone? You'll drive your wife and kid nuts! I bet your daughter is just about ripe by now. What's her name, Janie?
Mention my family once more and you're dead.
You can't kill me, Jon. I've got something going this Saturday night ... it's gonna be worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaohs -- and only I can stop it.
You can tell me all about it -- from your prison cell.
-- Castor?
Not anymore.
It can't be. It's impossible.
You killed them?
Of course I killed them, you DUMB FUCK. And torched every shred of evidence that proves who you really are. Swallow this one, Commander. You are going to be in here for the rest of your life.
What are you going to do, Castor?
What are you going to do!
Stay away from my family!
What -- what are you doing?
I don't know. How long before it kills us?
Give up, Castor. People are going to find out.
Jamie ...
They're too tight.
You'll what?
You better be nice, Castor. You could get mighty lonely now that Pollux is gone.
Pollux is -- what?
Archer cut him a deal for turning state's evidence. He's free.
Walton, you have to let me see the warden --
SFPD? Castor isn't stupid enough to come back to the city.
We've got him sighted. Okay, Pollux, pull out.
What makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother?
Just saving the tax-payers the cost of a trial. So take a hike.
What's the matter with your voice, Commander?
Screw your boundaries, Janie. You have something I want.
Clarissa left those here.
I won't tell mom if you don't.
When did you start smoking?
Get a higher arc on the ball, Jamie. And for Chrissake, square your shoulders to the basket.
What are you -- stupid?
You haven't changed at all! Some guy tries to rape me -- and you side with him!
Did it look like I was siding with him? Did it? You want to play with the bad boys, you better be prepared. Do you have protection?
You mean like ... condoms?
There's my little darling. The night wouldn't be complete without you.
Oh -- Commander. I didn't see you ...
Well, I saw you -- Kim.
Kim?
That's your name, isn't it?
You always call me Miss Brewster.
You've got someone in your office.
Get rid of them.
You picked a helluva day to leave your beeper off!
What happened?
Castor's escaped!
What happened?
Commander, what are you doing here?
Where should I be? Where's everyone else?
Backing you up! Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?
What?
It was confirmed by your personal security code. Nobody knows that code but you!
You're both in custody until there's a DNA fingerprinting and we can prove who's who. Now put the gun down.
You merciless bastard!
I can't even look at you without wanting to vomit.
-- I'll be one of the most powerful men in the country. Didn't matter how much cash I made pulling wet jobs -- I was still too low on the food chain -- always with somebody like Jon Archer after me. The best part is -- I'm the GOOD guy.
No -- the best part is, since it's a government job -- they can't fire you! But how can you be sure you'll get the appointment?
Don't get mad, but I just went for a little stroll through the company switches.
You're supposed to be snitching, making me look legit.
Don't worry, nobody knows I'm inside. Check it out. Remember that fat fuck agent who roughed us up in Thailand? He's being treated for bone cancer at the V.A. Thanks to the miracle of NSA grid-technology ... -- Ooops! His radiation does just quadrupled.
Are you TRYING to give us away? For somebody with such a big brain, you think awfully small.
I'm just having some fun.
Eight pocket stingers ... seven piper uzis ... six cobra carbines ... five - net - launch-ers ...
We gut the organization -- and rebuild it with more reliable friends.
Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
All of them do. We'll kill twelve birds with one bomb. And we'll be rich.
You'll need to recultivate that virus.
What about me?
A lot of people think you're a snitch. It's dangerous ...
Look at you, Jon -- at your age -- an American hero! I'd buy you a drink but I know you'd just turn me down.
You're the only person in this place who can see right through me.
You've made us look pretty good in the past week. And the way you handled the press --
Just following your example.
D.C.'s very high on giving you the promotion. There's just one problem.
What's that?
Me. I have doubts about your ability to stick with what is essentially a desk job.
You'd have to start immediately.
Done. In fact, I was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs.
I just heard about Castor's fratricide -- rather poetic, don't you think?
What is it, Admiral? I'm under the gun here.
I just thought that -- under the circumstances -- you might want to postpone the meeting with the station chiefs.
No. Most of them are in transit by now. I'm heading over to the hotel to personally oversee security.
What happened to your big "assignment"?
What do you know about it?
As much as ever. Nothing.
It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?
The hospital.
The hospital? Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor. Ha-ha.
Jon -- I don't have time to play games. There're leftovers in the fridge.
What is with you tonight?
Don't I usually kiss my wife?
Hurry up -- the salad's getting warm and the pasta's getting cold.
Why do I feel like I'm on a blind date?
I think -- you're trying to get me drunk.
Wouldn't be the first time -- or would it?
So -- how long will you be gone this time?
Gone?
Isn't that what all this is about? Letting Jamie go out, cooking me dinner, -- your next assignment?
I'm not going anywhere.
You always say that -- then you leave.
-- what?
I'm replacing Lazarro. Nice, safe desk job -- just like you wanted.
... That's great.
You're wearing your suit --
What's on your mind?
Jon, it's the tenth. I know how difficult it is for you, but we still have to go.
I'm late. Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.
The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.
Great.
Great? He's 17 -- you told her to stay away from him.
Oh, that Karl.
Yes, Jon. That Karl.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
I disagree. You think I've been acting strange. Like a completely different person.
-- Yes.
Where's Jamie?
I'll deal with her later.
I'm going to the powder room.
Remember this from our junior prom? Boy, were you ever mad for Madonna.
Back then -- who wasn't?
You too? This holiday's about giving, Adelle. And I'm giving everything I've got to this deal, so in a way, I'm more Christmassy than anyone... Lifesaver?
Oh, and Oxxford called...
Kate Reynolds...
Her assistant?
Yeah Jack, her assistant...
Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college. I almost married her...
You? Married?
Almost married. And almost a junior broker at E.F. Hutton...
Excuse me?
She didn't want me to go to London. We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
So you left her? Just like that?
God, no. I thought about it for practically the entire flight...
Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
I took the road less traveled, Adelle.
No...
No?! You almost married this woman. Aren't you even curious what she wants?
I'll leave from the office tomorrow afternoon. Call the group. Schedule an emergency strategy session for noon.
Hello?
Hey Santa, where are you? Everybodys here.
Adelle?
Sorry, Jack. I told Dee and the kids I'd be home by dinner. You know, it being Christmas Eve and all.
You think I like being here on Christmas Eve, Alan?
You're right, Jack. Sorry... Jack approaches Alan.
I don't want you to be sorry, Alan, I want you to be excited. I want my gift to be the first one you open this year. You know why?
Why Jack?
Mr. Mintz.
Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here...
You have kids, Jack?
I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton.
A broker? Really. And now youre in the tire business?
Thats right. And auto supply...
Uh...we actually get about sixty percent of our business from automotive service.
Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark...
We did one point seven million in total revenue...
Well, Alan, I think were gonna have a banner year. Sales are up almost twenty percent in the first quarter and we just landed a major trucking company account.
Look, I know our paltry little two million in sales is about what you spend on office supplies in a year. And I know some regional trucking company account is nothing compared to a sixty billion dollar merger...
Im not trying to knock the tire business, Jack.
And I know people.
Take you, for instance...
What about me?
...thats our war room. We did seven major deals last year, three of them hostile.
Good for you. Why shouldnt you protect whats yours.
I dont think youre hearing me.
Jack, are you okay?
Whats going on here?
Excuse me?
But I think I like you better this way...
No.
Rise...and...shine...!
Mom, dont you think we need to open the presents?
Were almost done here...
Mary Janes, Mom. You promised.
Fightings a part of it, Annie. You know that, right?
This isnt my real life. Its just a glimpse...
Wheres my real dad?
They did a pretty good job.
Who did?
The aliens...In the mother ship. You look just like him.
Do you like kids?
On a case by case basis...
You know how to make chocolate milk?
I think I could figure it out.
You promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains?
This is day care. Its where babies go when their parents are at work.
I have winter camp until four, then ballet until five thirty.
Five thirty. Okay.
Try not to be late because kids dont like to be the last one picked up.
Got it. Good tip.
Where do I go now?
Big Eds.
Big Eds? Big Eds Tires? Why...?
Not bad...I shoulda warned you. Dad always does something really special for their anniversary.
Like what?
One year he had a solar system named after her...
Dont you think thats a little gimmicky?
Maybe theres a jewelry store back at the mall. I could get her a pair of earrings or something.
Thats good but...you did forget the anniversary.
Very nice. What is it?
Mary Had A Little Lamb.
What are you doing?
Is it morning yet?
I know, I moved the Barca-lounger into the corner. Its throwin everybody off. What do you think?
Were friends, arent we?
Im having kind of a bad day.
What am I saying? You dont need to hear that... All I meant was a lot of people have a hard time dealing with all the forced reverie, thats all. Is that you?
Is it...?
Trouble at work?
I dont think so.
You see, its like were in each others heads...
Look, you fit the profile exactly. Thirties, house, kids, financial responsibilities. You start thinking...this isnt the life I dreamt about. Wheres the romance, wheres the joie de vivre? Suddenly, every lingerie ad in the Newark Star Ledger represents a life you cant have...
Damn...
Wheres your follow through? Wheres your stance?
Hey, Im doing the best I can... Id like to see you hit a squash ball after seventeen beers...
Hey Jack, youre all flush. I guess that seventy-one took a lot outta you.
I just saw Evelyn Thompson.
She is relentless.
She wants to have an affair with me.
She said that?
Pretty much.
Oh yeah... What is it about you?
So could you write down her exact address?
Whoa...whoa...wait a second, Jack. Youre not actually gonna cheat on Kate?
It wouldnt really be cheating... Its complicated.
Look, maybe Im not as good a consigliere as you are but you have to trust me on this one. A little flirtations harmless but youre playing with fire here. The Fidelity Bank and Trust is a tough creditor. You make a deposit somewhere else, they close your account forever.
Im telling you, those rules dont apply to me, Arn.
Cmon, Evelyn Thompsons got no class. She doesnt marry Dr. Steve, the womans living in a trailer.
Hey, is that really necessary?
So Jack, its your wifes birthday, got anything to say to her?
Hey, you cant park that thing here.
Its me, Jack...
I dont care if youre Tim Allen with your fancy car and all your tools, you still cant park here.
Tell me you recognize me, Arnie. Please...
Howd you know my name?
We bowl together. Were bowlers ...we won a championship...were winners.
Wait a second... Jack...Jack...
Yes...Jack Campbell...
Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right? Youre doing well...
Yes, thats it...yes, we went to high school together.
You never really talked to me. I wanted to talk to you, man...
Wheres my car?! Wheres my Ferrari!?
What the hell are you talking about? Whats he talking about?
Look, can I just borrow your car?! I promise itll be returned!
Got a minute, Jack?
Cmon Jack...
DO YOU WANNA DIE?!
No.
Yes you do...
Like I said, it's a business deal...
How'd you know my name was Jack?
You know you seem pretty relaxed for a guy who just had a gun pulled on him.
There's no way I was gonna die in that deli... Let's just say I've been on a lucky streak lately.
So you're telling me, you've got a gun to your head and you don't think for one second, what if this, what if that, maybe I shouldn't do this, I shoulda done that.
Okay, Jack. Nice doing business with you... Cash is about to take off...
What do you want to carry that gun around for, anyway? You're just gonna do something you'll regret...
I'm just saying that you seem like a smart guy. At a certain point you're gonna do something, and then there's no turning back...
I mean there must be programs out there, opportunities...
Oh man, you're serious... This man thinks I need to be saved!
Yeah? What do you need?
Me?
You just said everyone needs something.
I've got everything I need.
Look, I'm not saying you'd be able to do it without some hard work...
You still think this is about me, don't you?
Sure it's about you. But it's about society, too.
Miss me, Jack?
Thats my car! You stole my car!
Its a callable asset seized in accordance with the acquisition by-laws of your alt-fate contract...
What?!
Might wanna fasten your seat belt, Jack...
Look, I dont know what youre getting so worked up about, you did this...you brought this on yourself.
Brought what on myself?! I didnt do anything!
No? Cmon, Jack...Ive got everything I need, I dont have regrets, thats just not for me... sound familiar?
Everyone else in that store is a statue, they see their lives passing in front of their eyes, but not you. Youre making a business deal...
Give me my goddamn life back!
You? What about me? Im working hard for you here, Jack. On Christmas too! Now you did a good thing last night, intervening that way. I was moved...
Its a glimpse, Jacko.
I glimpse? A glimpse of what!? What glimpse?! Glimpse!
Look, eventually, everybody gets one...some of em take a couple seconds... ...some of em take a lot longer...
Figure it out. You got plenty of time.
How much time?!
As long as it takes to figure it out. Which, in your case, could be considerable.
Do I look like I need your money. It doesnt work like that and I cant tell you why.
Why not?
Because you got to figure it out for yourself. Are you listening to me?
Thats it? Thats all I get?! A glare?!
Whats this, a signal? Will you come whenever I ring it?
But what do I do?
You cant do this. You cant keep coming in and out of peoples lives, messing things up...
Ive got kids, Im going home...
...06...14...18...48...right there. Four numbers...that's two hundred and thirty eight dollar... Merry Christmas and shit...
Ticket bad. You draw in lines with pencil.
What're you talkin' about?
What!? Look at the ticket...!
You leave now. Take ticket somewhere else. Next customer in line...!
You first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making...
Like the dress...?
Its lovely...
Finger food...?
I dont think so, thank you...
Mushroom puffs arent the only thing I do well...
Evelyn, right?
Very funny. I saw you out there on lane five. What do you have the flu or something?
Something like that.
Need a nurse?
Are we...?
Are we what, Jack?
Are we finally being honest?
It would help me if we were.
I'm thinking I might walk tonight, Frank.
Merry Christmas to you, sir...
Whoa, whoa, whoa...hold it right there...
Frank. Wheres Alan Mintz? Is he here yet?
Mr. Mintz? I dont think so...buildings closed pal. Youll have to come back tomorrow.
Look, I dont know whats going on here but I am Senior Vice President of this company.
I dont care who you are. Its Christmas and like I told you the building is closed.
Do I have a private office somewhere in the building?
Uh...sure Jack... Right back there...
...I was the number one junior sales associate at E.F. Hutton in 1988. Did you know that?
No, I didnt...thats great.
Thats the kind of thing you can really build on...
Uh huh...
Here we are, mag wheels... Hey Jack, are you sure youre okay?
Kates on two, Jack. Nice ride...
If youre into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
Why dont you let me take this one, Kenny?
Merry Christmas, Mr. Campbell.
Howd you do this year, Tony?
About four grand. And a bottle of twenty five year old scotch from Mrs. Johnson in 9D. Im putting it all in commercial paper like you said.
Sorry, pal. Entrance is for residents and guests only...
What are you talking about? Its me, Jack Campbell. Penthouse C. I put you into commercial paper!
Every one of these songs will remind you of me in a slightly different way...
All in one tape?
I have a bad feeling about this.
About the plane? What do you think its gonna crash? Dont say that...
Dont go, Jack...
You mean dont go at all? What about my internship?
Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
For us, Kate.
Right, for us. But...Im afraid that if you get on that plane...
Go. Im sorry, you should just go...
No, youre right. What are we doing?
I can't seem to let go of you...
Are you okay?
What kind of man does that!?
Where were you?
I was in the city.
The city? New York City? Why?
Because thats where I live.
Jack...dont even start...
Look, we dont have time for this right now, well talk about it later. Now get dressed... Youre not wearing that to the Thompsons party. I dont care how hilarious you think it is...
Party? Oh no, I cant go to a party...
You look forward to this party all year. Whats with you today?
What are you doing?
Telling my mother she doesnt have to stay with the kids.
Why not?
Christ... Where the hell is the bathroom?
Yes, Im fine. Its just this god awful football phone! Who has a phone like this anyway?!
Jack...
Here you go...
Youre kidding me...
Shes your dog, Jack.
No, shes not.
Fine, shes the kids dog. Lets go wake Josh, see if he wants to walk her.
But its twenty degrees outside...
Hello!
...my feet are hurtin...
Uh...that babys crying...
Jack. I said the kids are asleep...
Hey! I was watching that!
I thought we had a deal about you watching CNBC in bed.
Wait a second. You want me, dont you?
Shouldnt we grab some dinner first? Maybe a bottle of wine...?
Its ten thirty, Jack. By eleven youre gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. We dont have time for wining and dining.
Thanks, Jack...
No, Im serious...youre really stunning...
This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...
How can you do that?
Do what?
I mean...wow...off the charts great.
$2,400?! Are you out of your mind?
She got those shoes...
No?
Do you have any idea what my life is like?
Excuse me?
I pick up the kids, walk the dog, which by the way, carries the added bonus of carting away her monstrous crap...I play with the kids, take out the garbage, get six hours of sleep if Im lucky, and then it starts all over again...and why is it that I always have to drive everyone everywhere? I spend practically my entire day in that
Really.
Its sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, Jack.
Look, Im sorry. Im sorry I was such a saint before and Im such a prick now. Maybe Im just not the same guy I was when we got married...
Well...Annie for one.
Surprise. Were pregnant... Yeah...that mustve been...I mean that was very unexpected. But what are you gonna do, right?
I think it worked out okay, dont you?
Sure. I really like Annie.
Good, Jack. Maybe well keep her.
No, I love Annie. We had a lot of good times, didnt we?
We were young... Remember that little place on Charles Street we used to go to?
Charles Street? In the Village? When we were living in Greenwich Village...? Great times. Whyd we ever leave?
The trek out to the hospital every day didnt help either... You were great. Surviving the heart attack was one thing...
You had a heart attack?
Jack, stop that. I'm still mad at you... ...who knows what wouldve happened if you hadnt stepped in at the store.
Our life in a nutshell...
If you want to look at it that way...
How was the game, honey?
You mean this chocolate cake?
Cmon.
You want the cake!?
Thank you...
Say it, Jack...
What...?
Cmon, you know what I like to hear...
Yeah, baby, I know what you like to hear...
Then say it...just say it to me...!
Not it...?
Nice, Jack. Youre sweeping me off my feet.
Jack.
Maybe I should wait...
I found it at an outlet store. I know its a knock-off, but I think itll look great on you...
You really are incredible...
Heres the thing. I really hadnt planned on giving you your...uh... anniversary gift until tonight. You know, anniversarys good all day...
What are you talking about? You never wait all day. You can barely wait until its light out.
You actually forgot our anniversary.
Jack...can we afford all this?
Whats the difference? Im taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...
You are so not off the hook yet, slick.
I need to tell you something.
Okay...
Now Im worried...just say it. Whatever it is well deal with it.
I used to be so sure about everything, you know? I knew exactly who I was and what I wanted. Then one morning I woke up and suddenly it was all different...
Worse, you mean...
I never used to be like this, Kate. I had it all figured out. No doubts, no regrets.
And now...?
I think its good to be a little unsure about who you are. Its very human.
But you always seem so certain.
Cmon, Jack, you think there arent mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell Im doing in New Jersey...
Thats a big one for me, too.
My office is a dump, I answer my own phone...and youve seen my pay check.
Your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks.
I mean yes, I help people that need it...
I guess...some of them are probably faking.
Imagine having a life where everything was easy...where you asked for things and people just brought them to you...
Good things...
You know champagne makes me do crazy things.
I dont know how you did it, hoss, but you pulled it off.
Im out of the doghouse?
Youre so...beautiful...
My god, all this time...I never stopped loving you...
I could stay here forever...
Pretty incredible, isnt it?
So whats the big surprise? You didnt rent this place for the weekend, did you?
Think bigger.
This place is a perk, Kate.
A perk for what?
Youre talking to their new Vice President of Mergers and Acquisitions.
Are you out of your mind?
I dont think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey. Well put Annie and Josh in private schools...
Annie goes to a great school.
Im talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate...
Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job?
This is New York City, its like the needy people capital of the world. Those Jersey clients of yours arent a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here...
I cant believe you want to move back into the city. I thought the reason we left was because we didnt want to raise the kids here?
No, this is the center of the universe. If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else? Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon.
I can do that. I want to do that. For all of us. I need to do that as a man... Think about it. No more lousy restaurants, no more clipping coupons, no more shoveling snow...
Dont do that...
Its been interesting, thats for sure.
But Ive done some good things too, havent I?
I need you to remember me, Kate. How I am right now, right this very moment. I need you to put that image in your heart and keep it with you, no matter what happens.
Are you okay, Jack?
I promise, Jack...
Promise me again...
Kate...
You look great.
I'm sorry...
Whats going on?
Im moving to Paris...it was right here... Its a box marked Jack. I put it in the stack for the Salvation Army...
Youre moving...
Uh huh. To Paris. My firm has an office there and Im going to be heading it up.
To Paris. Paris, France.
Thats the one...
So youre not at a non- profit firm?
Not with what they pay me...
Youre not married, are you?
No, Jack, I never got married. You?
You cant go!
Jesus, Jack...
Dont get on that plane!
Jack.
Please. Lets just go have a cup of coffee. Thats all Im asking for. Im sure theres another flight to Paris tonight.
Dont do this, Jack... But he continues...
Mrs. Peterson.
Hello Jack. You dont have to stop singing on my account...
Its because Im shy, Betty. So, when are you going to leave that old corpse Mr. Peterson and run away with me?
No...
Thank you, Betty. I know if I can just sleep this off, Ill be fine...
And sleep you shall. Noblesse oblige is not dead. Not yet anyway...Come, lets get you some help. Surely there must be a shelter somewhere in this city.
Peter. I don't see you rushing home to trim the tree.
That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
I just got a call from Terry Haight. Bob Thomas is nervous...
That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
Someone's gonna have to nurse him through this.
Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?
I need you, tiger..
Where is he?
Hey Peter, lemme ask you a question. An old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on Christmas Eve...
You suddenly having trouble getting dates?
Not by a long shot.
Peter Lassiter...
Do I know you?
...were really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...
He certainly has your number, Alan.
For one thing, you like expensive things.
Thats easy. Youve seen my car.
For the money, theyre hands down the best radial we carry...
Okay, Ill take them...
Can I help you?
Is Kate here? Does Kate live here?!
Damn...damn...damn...
Hey, are you okay?
No...Im not...
Hey, my wifes in the kitchen. You got a cigarette?
Did you really mean what you said about Tuscany?
Of course I did.
Last night was great...
You are an amazing lover. You should be giving motivational seminars.
I want to see you again.
I'd like that, too.
It's Christmas Eve, Jack.
I have to go to my parents' house out in Jersey. Would you like to come?
Jersey? You know what the traffic's gonna be like?
Don't you have anywhere to go?
Maybe I can try and sneak away some time tomorrow morning... Okay?
Thats totally see through...
Merry Christmas...
Do you want me to look for the box or call the airline?
Hey, kind of under a little pressure here.
You didnt seem to mind offering to help me on Christmas day when you were unwrapping that Prada bag I gave you.
Ill go for a cup of coffee!
I found it!
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
You don't know what it's like out there. Walking around like some kind of circus freak. People staring, whispering --
I wouldn't know anything about that.
I mean...
I don't think She's real big on hate.
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
How'd you know it was me?
I'm not really dressed for a party.
Relax, it's casual.
Those yours too?
We're going to have to work on your touch.
Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here? This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --
He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
I can't take this.
What about his first born?
He <u>knew</u> about NASA. What if he made the call to shut us down --
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
Maybe you should think about <u>yourself</u> for once. You always let this guy push you round --
We got what we wanted. That's <u>enough</u>.
Can't do it. I cannot do it.
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
They crashed it into a wall. A flight <i>simulator</i>.
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
Five times.
I had it at four.
Isn't that <u>your</u> speech?
He's made a few changes.
This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.
The shields on the station should protect us.
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
How long was I out?
Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
I don't know. I just keep going over and over the numbers.
Reed. Even <u>you</u> can't compute every little thing.
You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
What? Come on. She's got a good thing with Victor --
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
He's smart, powerful, successful --
Are you alright?
What the --!
Ben. Are you okay?
We had a tough year.
You got a chisel round here?
Okay. I've uh, got some questions, from Sue. That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom...like normal...
Yeah. You don't wanna know the details.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
It's about to be a broken face.
Ben --
Oh, you remember my name do you? You happen to remember what you <u>swore</u> to do with every breath in your body?
We're working as hard as we can --
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
Time for <u>your</u> lesson, Vic. Chem 101: what happens when you <u>supercool</u> hot metal...? Ben...
Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine. I think if we can rework the power settings...
What the hell you smiling at? Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
'Course not. Strictly business.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
Where...where am I?
Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
Reed? ... Sue?
What's wrong with me?
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben. You had the best --
They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
Hey! That's a <u>prototype</u>!
The machine works. And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
No more cracks about how I look.
I'll be watching over you.
Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
Deb... It's me. I need you to step out front.
Ben?
Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
Oh my G-g-g. What did you...do to Ben?
What did you wish for, honey?
What are <u>you</u> doing here?
I'm worried about you.
About me? How sweet.
Ben, come in.
What is this? Where's Reed?
What do you want, Vic?
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."
Way to not overthink it. So when do we leave?
I can handle the ship. I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition. But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits. Who the hell came up with them?
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
You look like an eighties rock band.
The suit will stretch. You should try it --
He didn't.
Oh, he did.
He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
It's not him. It's <u>them</u>. I can't live like this.
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
It's easy for you to be patient.
<u>Where is Reed</u>?
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
And they're changing into...
I don't really know. A compound organic-metallic alloy. Stronger than titanium or carbon steel. Harder than diamonds --
Like the shields Reed said would protect us. How long?
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
What do you mean "complete"?
What?
But...this disease...is progressive... degenerative...
Victor's right. Johnny, get to the command center. Close the shields.
He's not responsive --
Now what is up with <i>that</i>?
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
Oh, you dawg you. Better not be my nurse!
This is wrong in so many ways.
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
Twenty? From outside the place looks a lot taller.
We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
This place is deluxe. You got cable?
Back it down, Johnny!
Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
He's right. These costumes are... missing something. I can't put my finger on it --
That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber. It's muscle, tendon. I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --
You need to control yourself and <u>think</u> before you --
Act. Here we go again. Reed, what if we got these gifts for a <u>reason</u>? What if we have some, you know...like, calling?
Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
But all these people...
And where do we think we're going?
You're hot!
So are you!
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
Me like-y.
Stay right. Left is trouble.
I though we went over this.
You're on fire!
Not this again --
The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
Apparently I can disappear.
Flame on, flame off. Flame on, flame off --
Stop it.
What is that <i>thing</i>?
Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around <u>on fire</u> for the rest of your life?
You're really cramping my style here.
You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
Sweet.
Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl...the Invisible Girl.
I'm driving.
You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles. What?!
You two need a time-out.
Johnny? Did you see Ben?
Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back to the real world.
Is that what you call it? "<i>Real</i>"?
Johnny, slow down. <u>Think</u>. You know mom didn't raise us to --
Look around, sis! <u>She's not here</u>. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
What are you doing --
Sis. Let <u>me</u> take care of <u>you</u> for once.
If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.
And if he's not...?
They're ready for you, sir.
Our numbers are through the roof. The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share. The bank's five times oversubscribed --
It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
Then what is it?
Leonard, how's the feed?
How's the IPO?
Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
Reed's disaster. You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal... I've <u>got to</u> do something about this scar. Make sure they only shoot my right side.
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
You know, maybe you should get some rest --
Sir, I've always wondered... Why <u>Sue</u>? You could have any woman in the world but --
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here. And keep it quiet. I don't need this to hit the press.
Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
Front page?
But dreams don't pay the bills, do they? Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
Got it. So take a walk, Ben...I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
We've got <u>minutes</u> until it hits, not hours...Victor, that storm's <u>deadly</u> -- the radiation's lethal. We need to abort.
Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the shields...
Ben's still out there --
Come on, Ben, come on...
Not until Ben is back inside!
Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
Ben did this.
<u>Ben</u> did this?
I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
Didn't go as <u>planned</u>? It was a <u>catastrophe</u>. You ruined the lives of four people --
<u>I</u> ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --
<u>Abort</u>? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will <u>not</u> let you make me look like a fool --
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
What are you doing here?
But I'm not done with the machine --
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
Well, uh, based on our history...you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics. Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
I, uh, think I remember the number.
As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules. I've been working on a formula for this.
Feeling better?
Yes, thanks.
That's good. That's uh...good.
You're <u>happy</u> for me and Victor.
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
Which was?
For science.
Uh, Sue...? I <u>can't</u>.
What? What do you mean you --
It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
What?
Sue. Your clothes. Lose them.
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
That's what we're here to find out.
It's not "invisibility" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field. That's what you projected on the Bridge.
You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger. Can you remember the exact emotions when --
Anger. Rage. Frustration.
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
I mean, <u>you</u> broke up with <u>me</u>, right?
Are you kidding?
Reed. I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
I think it was a little more complicated than --
There were a lot of variables to consider --
What are you doing?
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
And reverse the mutations --
But <u>we're</u> the focus, right Reed? <u>Reed</u>...?
Of course. Of course.
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
Reed. How close are we to a cure?
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
Which is why I'm working <u>twenty</u> hours a day, checking every variable --
Every variable but <u>yourself</u>. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous.
You <u>were</u>?
You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you...speak his mind. One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
When I walked out, I waited <u>ten</u> <u>minutes</u> outside your door. Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
Why didn't you say something?
I can...make it work.
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
I found a broken gasket, from space --
It's just business.
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
I understand the <i>business</i> reasons.
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
What are you doing?
Raising the shields.
What's going on?
Victor, I'm sorry I --
Victor, your scar --
I told you, I'm fine. It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
You said it was urgent.
Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
He's working round the clock. But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us <u>worse</u>, maybe even kill us.
Please don't make this personal --
Oh, I think you already have.
'Scuse me.
I know it can't be easy. Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny. At least they can go out in public. But for you? People staring. Whispering behind your back...
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
Reed's gonna fix me up --
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
Grant's uniquely qualified for this mission. He's a Communications Expert and was a Frogman during the War. Besides, he brought Benes into this country, and the fewer people who know about him, the better. At any rate, you'll find Grant invaluable, should anything go wrong once you're under way. Okay, Don.
Benes' natural defenses. White Corpuscles -- Antibodies. Once you begin to grow -- and become a menace to the body -- you'll trigger them off... MICHAELS With all the unknown factors in the body, I still say risking five lives for one is something we should reconsider --
Where do we stand?
Okay to proceed.
They've crossed over into the Jugular Vein!
That can't be -- there's no direct connection between the two --
But we have no choice! We've got, to take them out!
We still have fifty-one minutes. Leave them in.
But it's hopeless! They can't go back and they can't go on. I tell you there's nothing else we can do but remove them!
Doctor...without killing him -- how long could we stop his heart?
The less time, the better.
I know that. But what's the maximum?
At topspeed...and adjusting distance for Degree of Miniaturization -- The sub should get through the Heart in fifty-seven seconds.
That would give us only three seconds to revive him...
What are the problems in stopping the Heart?
<Cardiac Red Alert> we're stopping the Heart.
They're in the Pulmonary Artery.
Another delay... With only forty-two minutes left.
It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
I told you to cut down on the sugar.
Time's up... We'll have to take them out immediately.
What is it?
That blip we're picking up might only be the radio-active particle. The Proteus may already be destroyed...
What're you getting at?
If I were in their place and I'd run out of time, I'd abandon the ship before I grew to dangerous size... and use the few extra minutes to get out the quickest way possible, on my own...
Now how soon can we try Sodium Pentathol?
I'd hold that off awhile.
Hello, Grant. Good to see you again.
Benes... What the devil happened?
The Other Side got to him.
How bad off is he?
Brain injury.
Before or after what he wanted to tell you?
-- and why we need you.
I can't even put a Band-Aid on my finger.
Duval. Dr. Peter Duval. Top brain man in the country. Ever hear of him?
Sorry, but I'm rusty on surgeons. Who's the girl?
Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
Wish I knew why.
But why take the chance, when there must be other doctors?
We have no choice. Duval's the most skillful brain surgeon in the country, and he's right here, at hand.
Right, sir.
His technician okay? In addition to the Looks Department?
I don't mean to be inquisitive. But this <CMDF> -- for all I know it could stand for <Consolidated Mobilization of Female Delinquents>?
<Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
General, I've heard some wild ones. But this takes it.
We can shrink an Army -- with all its equipment -- and put it in a bottle cap. That's why we call it <Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
If the Other Side ever gets hold of a thing like that...
I assume Benes knows how to control it.
That's right. He wanted us to have the secret, and not them. Which is why they tried to kill him.
They're bound to try again. No wonder they want me to stand by during the operation.
And take a little trip with them...
Trip? Where to?
Well, the only way to reach that clot is from inside the Brain. So we've decided to put a Surgical Team and a Crew into a submarine -- reduce it way down in size, and inject it into an Artery --
You mean <I'm> going along?
As part of the Crew.
Wait a minute! They can't shrink <me>!
Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.
But I don't want to be Miniaturized -- !
It's only for an hour --
This is Dr. Duval, our Head Surgeon.
There'll be a team of Surgeons standing by. We're prepared to remove you immediately, should anything go wrong. In any event, you must be out within sixty minutes. After that, you'll be in danger of attack.
Just one, General...
Yes?
Oh yes, great. The only problem is, he can't remember what he came to tell us.
Can't remember?... What do you mean?
Yes, we'd like to get moving.
Yes, Alan.
Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, Chief of the Medical Section.
[LINE OF DIALOGUE CUT OFF]
I don't agree. Just because he's often difficult --
Difficult? He's impossible!
I'll be standing by. <I'll> know.
Listen...the Heart.
I can't imagine how it possibly could have come loose. I distinctly recall fastening it with all four bolts --
But we just can't leave him in there! What'll happen to him?
That's beside the point now. I don't see the sense of going on.
We must!
You're going out there? With those Antibodies --
Wouldn't it be quicker if we all helped?
Doctor...
Yes, Cora.
What is it? Anything wrong?
I just wanted to thank you for taking me along.
Never saw <that>. Not even under an electron-mrcroscope.
Yes, a fistula too small to show up on the X-rays.
Doctor...you can't mean that! Not when we've come this far. And if we give up, there'll be no way of saving Mr. Benes --
Air bubbles!... Doctor --
Cora, is something wrong with the laser?
He's making a fine recovery.
Bet you're pretty handy around the house... Can you cook?
We're pushing oxygen today.
I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am.
You sound as if you're not looking forward to it.
Well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise.
I think it's the most exciting -- We're going to see things no one ever saw before. The actual physical process of Life itself -- not something under a microscope... Just think of it --
That's the trouble. I am. Being shrunk...
That'll teach you where to keep your hand.
That could be quite a lethal weapon... It could kill, not cure.
Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval. The beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter.
I understand you've been Dr. Duval's Assistant for quite some time... He must've snatched you out of the cradle.
I've been with him since I got out of school. He brought me into the CMDF, over five years ago.
A long time, with one man.
I never...never imagined it could be anything...like this.
-- at which point the Heart will be stopped by electric shock.
Look at that...they're changing color...
Looks like you didn't batten it down too well.
Then how come it worked loose?
Shouldn't you answer that?
I'll try to hold it from the other side of the wall, while you push from out here. Maybe that'll do it.
You must carry spare parts --
If you had a transistor about this size and power output, and a thin enough wire -- -- could you piece it together?
No, it requires such absolute precision --
A surgeon might...
Oh yes, I'm sure Dr. Duval could. If we had the parts.
Open it! Open it before they get here!
No need to get up --
Thank you for saving my life.
That's what they pay me for.
Such as?
Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...
That's why you're really here. I knew it from the start.
As obvious as that? Our Security people will jump for joy. I suppose Duval's onto me, too?
You're not the first, but he's much too innocent, much too involved with his work, to realize what's going on around him.
Under a cloud without cause, I take it.
Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.
Depends on which end of the telescope you look through.
What do you mean?
We better get back to the sub. Every second counts now.
Doctor, what's wrong?
I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!
Looks like the molecular structure of proteins.
I don't agree. I think we ought to stop and take a sample.
But that isn't possible.
We can't take a second more.
Nothing miraculous about it. Just an interchange of gases. The end product of five hundred million years of Evolution.
What can we do?
That puts us right here... Which means we can head straight for the Sub Arachnoid Cavity.
Yes...
It's against my better Judgment...
Better Judgment?! To wait until the actual operation -- when it may be too late?
I've done all I could with the laser.
All I'm asking is you test it beforehand!
If it won't work, it's beyond my power to fix it. But if it does, there's no telling how long it will hold up. It's a jury rig, at best, and we'll need every second of use we can get out of it. That's why I don't want to put any extra strain on the connections by running unnecessary tests.
Dr. Duvall I insist you test the laser.
I'll do nothing of the sort! The operation is <my> responsibility! I won't do it, and that's final!
As usual, you want everything your way. Except this time there's more than your damned ego at stake.
The Soul? The finite mind cannot comprehend Infinity. And the Soul which comes from God is Infinite.
--and certain chemicals involving proteins --
You left something out.
What's that?
Removal Point? What're you talking about!
Dr. Duval, you are not going through with this! I absolutely forbid it! I'm responsible for the lives of everyone here! I will not allow you or anyone else to leave this ship!
The Medieval Philosophers were right... <Man> is the center of the Universe... We stand in the middle of Infinity, between Outer and Inner Space. And there's no limit to either.
You mean Inner Space is endless?
Only to the naked eye. Those corpuscles -- carrying oxygen -- give the stream its color. But the rest of the plasma's very much like sea water. An ocean of life...
I'd hate to get lost on that Freeway...
Mind letting me in on what's going on out there?
A simple exchange, Mr. Grant. Corpuscles releasing carbon dioxide -- the moment they touch the Wall of the Lung -- in return for oxygen coming through from the other side.
Don't tell me they're refueling...
Just a few cells away from a vast air chamber -- one of the countless Alvioli of the Lung -- and we can't get enough to fill a microscopic tank.
Isn't there another surgical procedure you can try?
We'll never get there in time, at this rate.
Isn't there another route? So we can by-pass all this?
Yes... We can transfer over to the Inner Ear, and go by way of the Endolymphatic Duct.
"Yet all the suns that light the Corridors of the Universe shine dim, Before the blazing of a Single Thought -- "
How does it look, Doctor?
Doctor, we've just about had it.
The ship's good as finished. We'll have to get out on our own! Is there a quick way out?
You said there was a quick way out!
What about Dr. Michaels?
We need you for Security purposes, Mr. Grant.
At an operation?
They know they failed to kill Benes. Security thinks they'll try again, first chance they get. We're afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination.
Miss Peterson, his Technical Assistant.
About forty miles an hour.
A what?
If we can't go back, is there an alternate route?
That's just dandy. We can't go forward -- and we can't go back.
Tell them to take us out.
If there's any chance --
Sounds like heavy artillery...
There it is!
At this size, I would certainly think so.
In a way -- yes. Those are impurities imbedded in the Lung after a lifetime of 'Civilization.' Carbon from smoke and smog -- specks of dust --
Yes -- with all that pressure, and suction within --
All right now -- push the snorkel through as soon as I get inside.
Grant -- wait a minute -- you're not going to dismantle the wireless?
Just one little transistor and a circuit wire is all it takes.
But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.
Well, sir? Which is it? The wireless, or Benes' life?
Looks like the sea, at dawn.
We're safe -- long as it remains that color... We're in the Pleural Sac. It keeps the Lungs from rubbing against the Wall of the Chest up there. When those membranes become inflamed, we wind up with Pleurisy -- and a wracking cough.
Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --
His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
Sabotage? I don't understand...
I saw the laser just before we started. It was fastened down securely. You don't suppose what happened was an 'accident?' Any more than my safety line snapping after it was tied off to the sub?
You have no right to blame Duval --
That line was tampered with...
I -- I don't know what to say. I know he's under a cloud, but there's not a more dedicated man in the entire medical profession.
You still never know what's going on in anyone's mind...
I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident.
Two in a row?
We're entering the Lymphatic System. Those are nuclei of cells, lining a Duct.
I always had an idea there was only one System. The Circulatory.
Skipper, you're picking up seaweed -- or whatever it is.
Looks like somebody declared war.
They're tracking us Topside. Once they see where we're going, I'm sure they'll take every precaution.
Looks like quite a way to go...
Hold it, Skipper. What happens if we overstay?
Once time's up, De-Miniaturization begins. In a matter of seconds the ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the System. Then White Corpuscles will swarm to destroy it, as they would any invader.
I'm in charge of this mission! You were instructed to take orders from me, not give them!
Sorry, but the situation has changed.
I don't believe that.
Sorry we had to get you up at this hour, Mr. Grant.
I thought I was on my vacation... What's it all about?
I can't tell you.
Where we going?
May I?
What'd you do that for?
I'm married.
Out of your element, aren't you, Captain?
Sort of.
Atomic fuel?
If it's no military secret, how can a sub run on a microscopic particle?
They can't reduce nuclear fuel. But once the Reactor's Miniaturized -- along with the submarine -- a microscopic particle should emit enough energy to activate it.
That's cutting it mighty close -- for a perfect fit.
All in all, quite a canoe...
Designed for Piscatorial Research -- the Spawning Habits of Deep Sea Fish.
'Prepare for Miniaturization'...
Any reserve air?
I've come up against fanatics before, and Duval just doesn't fit the pattern. I'm going out there, Skipper. Maybe I can be of some help...
What happened?
Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...
Come on -- it's no use!
Who, me? Oh, no! Don't bother about me! We're not hurt! Isn't that right, Skipper?
Uh -- what?
We feel great, don't we? Just <great>?!
Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!
What is it, Skipper?
Yes, there is.
Thirty-two minutes left... But chances are we won't have to wait that long for try-number three.
What's wrong, Skipper?
How's it look?
Even so, because of our size -- I mean lack of it -- we'll still be cruising mighty fast. We'll be smashed to bits if there's any turbulence --
Captain, how will you be able to follow my charts -- --from up there?
That's it...
I'll never find my way through that.
Well, that takes care of the valve. It was probably caused by that electric shock.
Was there any damage?
It's a dangerous procedure. If I miss the timing, we could explode the tanks... But I'm willing to try it.
We could never fight that current it's physically impossible.
Then don't drift down further.
Doctor -- the channel's getting awful narrow.
We're entering a Capillary. Remain in the middle.
The Wall's transparent...
There seems to be something wrong with the Escape Hatch...
What do you mean?
...What do you mean, you decided not to park here?
You, uh... I'm sorry, sir, but -
I decided not to - I'm, uh, not taking the trip as it turns out.
I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.
I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here!
Ophhem ma fuchem gaphe!
Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you?
I got your goddamn money, you little punk. Now where's my daughter?
I am through fucking around! Drop that fucking briefcase!
Where's my daughter?
Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -
Where's my damn daughter? No Jean, no money!
Drop that fucking money!
No Jean, no money!
...Is this a fucking joke?
This is a new car, then, sir?
It certainly is, officer. Still got that smell!
You're required to display temporary tags, either in the plate area or taped inside the back window.
Certainly -
Can I see your license and registration please?
...So maybe the best thing would be to take care of that, right here in Brainerd.
What's this, sir?
Just in town on business. Just in and out. Ha ha! A little of the old in-and-out!
Wuddya do? Carl looks around.
Have ya been to the Celebrity Room before? With other, uh, clients?
I don't think so. It's nice.
... What is he, deaf?... So, uh, how long have you been with the escort service?
I don't know. Few munce.
Ya find the work interesting, do ya?
Or your fucking wife, you know.
Where is Pancakes Hause?
What?
We stop at Pancakes Hause.
...Come on, man. Okay, here's an idea. We'll stop outside of Brainerd. I know a place there we can get laid. Wuddya think?
I'm fuckin' hungry now, you know.
...Look at that. Twin Cities. IDS Building, the big glass one. Tallest skyscraper in the Midwest. After the Sears, uh, Chicago... You never been to Minneapolis?
No.
...Would it kill you to say something?
I did.
Unguent.
Huh? Grimsurd looks at his thumb.
Shut the fuck up or I'll throw you back in the trunk, you know.
You'll take care of it. Boy, you are smooth smooth, you know.
Clear him off the road.
She started shrieking, you know.
...You c'n'ave my truck. I'm takin' a Shiera.
One of us pays the other for half.
...So I guess that's it, then. Here's the keys -
No, that's not it, Jerry.
Huh?
The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.
Yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom. I thought Shep told you -
Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.
Well, okay, it's -
Except that you were gonna be here at 7:30.
Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.
Yeah, you already said that.
Yah. But it's not a whole pay-in- advance deal. I give you a brand-new vehicle in advance and -
I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.
Okay.
I'm not gonna sit here and debate. I will say this though: what Shep told us didn't make a whole lot of sense.
Oh, no, it's real sound. It's all worked out.
You want your own wife kidnapped?
...You-my point is, you pay the ransom- what eighty thousand bucks? - I mean, you give us half the ransom, forty thousand, you keep half. It's like robbing Peter to play Paul, it doesn't make any -
Okay, it's - see, it's not me payin' the ransom. The thing is, my wife, she's wealthy - her dad, he's real well off. Now, I'm in a bit of trouble -
What kind of trouble are you in, Jerry?
Well, that's, that's, I'm not go inta, inta - see, I just need money. Now, her dad's real wealthy -
Well, it's all just part of this - they don't know I need it, see. Okay, so there's that. And even if they did, I wouldn't get it. So there's that on top, then. See, these're personal matters.
Personal matters.
Yah. Personal matters that needn't, uh -
...Who's Jean?
My wife! What the - how's -
Oh, Jean's okay. But there's three people up in Brainerd who aren't so okay, I'll tell ya that.
What the heck're you talkin' about? Let's just finish up this deal here -
...Blood has been shed.
What the heck d'ya mean?
Three people. In Brainerd.
Oh, geez.
That's right. And we need more money.
The heck d'ya mean? What a you guys got yourself mixed up in?
We need more -
This was s'posed to be a no-rough stuff-type deal -
DON'T EVER INTERRUPT ME, JERRY! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!
Well, I'm sorry, but I just - I -
Look. I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry. The price is now the whole amount. We want the entire eighty thousand.
Oh, for Chrissakes here -
Blood has been shed. We've incurred risks, Jerry. I'm coming into town tomorrow. Have the money ready.
Now we had a deal here! A deal's a deal!
IS IT, JERRY? You ask those three pour souls up in Brainerd if a deal's a deal! Go ahead, ask 'em!
...The heck d'ya mean?
Yah, I got the money, but, uh -
Don't you fucking but me, Jerry. I want you with this money on the Dayton- Radisson parking ramp, top level, thirty minutes, and we'll wrap this up.
Yah, okay, but, uh -
You're there in thirty minutes or I find you, Jerry, and I shoot you, and I shoot your fucking wife, and I shoot all your little fucking children, and I shoot 'em all in the back of their little fucking heads. Got it?
...Yah, well, you stay away from Scotty now -
GOT IT?
We sat here right in this room and went over this and over this!
Yah, but that TruCoat -
I sat right here and said I didn't want no TruCoat!
Yah, but I'm sayin', that TruCoat, you don't get it and you get oxidization problems. It'll cost you a heck of lot more'n five hunnert -
You're sittin' here, you're talkin' in circles! You're talkin' like we didn't go over this already!
Yah, but this TruCoat -
We had us a deal here for nineteen- five. You sat there and darned if you didn't tell me you'd get this car, these options, WITHOUT THE SEALANT, for nineteen-five!
Okay, I'm not sayin' I didn't -
You called me twenty minutes ago and said you had it! Ready to make delivery, ya says! Come on down and get it! And here ya are and you're wastin' my time and you're wastin' my wife's time and I'm payin' nineteen- five for this vehicle here!
Well, he never done this before, but seein' as it's special circumstances and all, he says I can knock one hunnert off that TruCoat.
One hunnert's the best we can do here.
Yah, ya got yer, this loaded here, this has yer independent, uh, yer slipped differential, uh, yer rack- and-pinion steering, yer alarm and radar, and I can give it to ya with a heck of a sealant, this TruCoat stuff, it'll keep the salt off -
Yah, I don't need no sealant though.
Ah, well, we haven't had to run around like you. When're you due?
End a April.
Any others?
This'll be our first. We've been waiting a long time.
That's wonderful. Mm-mm. It'll change your life, a course.
Oh, yah, I know that!
They can really take over, that's for sure.
I thought you'd never ask. The older one is Janet, she's nine, and the younger one is Morgan.
Oh, now he's adorable.
He's three now. Course, not in that picture.
Oh, he's adorable.
Yah, he -
Both of these.
Oh, no, I can't let you do that.
Oh, don't be silly.
Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
How ya doin'?
Mr. Mohra?
Yah.
Officer Olson.
...So, I'm tendin' bar there at Ecklund & Swedlin's last Tuesday and this little guy's drinkin' and he says, 'So where can a guy find some action - I'm goin' crazy down there at the lake.' And I says, 'What kinda action?' and he says, 'Woman action, what do I look like,' And I says 'Well, what do I look like, I don't arrange
Uh-huh.
So he says, 'So I get it, so you think I'm some kinda jerk for askin',' only he doesn't use the word jerk.
I unnerstand.
And then he calls me a jerk and says the last guy who thought he was a jerk was dead now. So I don't say nothin' and he says, 'What do ya think about that?' So I says, 'Well, that don't sound like too good a deal for him then.'
Ya got that right.
And he says, 'Yah, that guy's dead and I don't mean a old age.' And then he says, 'Geez, I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake.'
White Bear Lake?
Well, Ecklund & Swedlin's, that's closer ta Moose Lake, so I made that assumption.
Oh sure.
So, ya know, he's drinkin', so I don't think a whole great deal of it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the homicides out here and she thought I should call it in, so I called it in. End a story.
What'd this guy look like anyways?
Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny- lookin'.
Uh-huh - in what way?
Just a general way.
Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr. Mohra. You're right, it's probably nothin', but thanks for callin' her in.
Oh sure. They say she's gonna turn cold tomorrow.
Yah, got a front movin' in.
Hiya, Norm. How ya doin', Margie? How's the fricassee?
Pretty darn good, ya want some?
The numbers y'asked for, calls made from the lobby pay phone at the Blue Ox. Two to Minneapolis that night.
Mm.
First one's a trucking company, second one's a private residence. A Shep Proudfoot.
Uh-huh... A what?
Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.
Uh-huh.
Yah.
...Yah, okay, I think I'll drive down there, then.
Where you girls from?
Well, the little guy, he was kinda funny-looking.
In what way?
I dunno. Just funny-looking.
Can you be any more specific?
I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.
Was he funny-looking apart from that?
Yah.
So you were having sex with the little fella, then?
Uh-huh.
Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
No. Like I say, he was funny-looking. More'n most people even.
They said they were goin' to the Twin Cities?
LeSeure. But I went to high school in White Bear Lake.
He was a little older. Looked like the Marlboro man.
Yah?
Yah. Maybe I'm sayin' that cause he smoked Marlboros.
Uh-huh.
A subconscious-type thing.
Yah, that can happen.
I'm talkin' about your potential.
Uh-huh.
You're not a C student.
Uhn.
And yet you're gettin' C grades. It's this disparity there that concerns your dad and me.
Uh-huh.
You know what a disparity is?
Yeah!
Okay. Well, that's why we don't want ya goin' out fer hockey.
...What's the big deal? It's an hour -
Good to see ya again, Jerry. If these numbers are right, this looks pretty sweet.
The financials are pretty thorough, so the only thing we don't know is your fee.
Jerry - we thought you were bringin' us an investment.
Yah, right -
No, see, I don't need a finder's fee, I need - finder's fee's, what, ten percent, heck that's not gonna do it for me. I need the principal.
We're not horse-trading here, Wade, we just gotta bite the bullet on this thing.
Yah!
What's the next step here, Jerry?
Okay. We'll get the money together. Don't worry about it, Jerry. Now, d'you want anyone at home, with you, until they call?
No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear.
Ya know, they said no one listenin' in, they'll be watchin', ya know. Maybe it's all bull, but like you said, Stan, they're callin' the shots.
Okay. And Scotty, is he gonna be all right?
Wade's got a point there. I'll handle the call if you want, Jerry.
So you're goin' to the Gophers on Sunday?
You bet.
You wouldn't have an extra ticket there?
They're playin' the Buckeyes!
Yah.
...Yah, okay...
...How ya doin' there, Scotty?
Dad! What're they doing? Wuddya think they're doin' with Mom?
It's okay, Scotty. They're not gonna want to hurt her any. These men, they just want money, see.
What if - what if sumpn goes wrong?
Dad, I really think we should call the cops.
No! We can't let anyone know about this thing! We gotta play ball with these guys - you ask Stan Grossman, he'll tell ya the same thing!
Yeah, but -
Mr. Lundegaard?
Huh? Yah?
I wonder if I could take just a minute of your time here -
What... What is it all about?
...You're the owner here, Mr. Lundegaard?
Naw, I... Executive Sales Manager.
Well, you can help me. My name's Marge Gunderson -
My father-in-law, he's the owner.
...Mr. Lundegaard?
...Brainerd?
Yah. Yah. Home a Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox.
...Babe the Blue Ox?
Yah, ya know we've got the big statue there. So you haven't had any vehicles go missing, then?
No. No, ma'am.
Yah, no, I'm kinda - I'm kinda busy -
I unnerstand. I'll keep it real short, then. I'm on my way out of town, but I was just - Do you mind if I sit down? I'm carrying a bit of a load here.
Yah, it's this vehicle I asked you about yesterday. I was just wondering -
Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had any vehicles go missing.
Okay, are you sure, cause, I mean, how do you know? Because, see, the crime I'm investigating, the perpetrators were driving a car with dealer plates. And they called someone who works here, so it'd be quite a coincidence if they weren't, ya know, connected.
Yah, I see.
So how do you - have you done any kind of inventory recently?
The car's not from our lot, ma'am.
but do you know that for sure without -
Well, I would know. I'm the Executive Sales Manager.
Yah, but -
We run a pretty tight ship here.
I know, but - well, how do you establish that, sir? Are the cars, uh, counted daily or what kind of -
... I'm sorry, sir?
Ma'am, I answered your question. I answered the darn - I'm cooperating here, and I...
Sir, you have no call to get snippy with me. I'm just doin' my job here.
Okay, I'll do a damned lot count!
Sir? Right now?
...If it's so damned important to ya!
Hon? Got the growshries.
Thank you, hon. How's Fargo?
Yah, real good.
Yah, real good. How you doin'?
Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard. You're damned hard to get on the phone.
Yah, it's pretty darned busy here, but that's the way we like it.
That's for sure. Now, I just need, on these last, these financing documents you sent us, I can't read the serial numbers of the vehicles on here, so I -
But I already got the, it's okay, the loans are in place, I already got the, the what, the -
Yeah, the three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, you got the money last month.
Yah, so we're all set.
Yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on, I just can't read the serial numbers on your application. Maybe if you could just read them to me -
But the deal's already done, I already got the money -
Yeah, but we have an audit here, I just have to know that these vehicles you're financing with this money, that they really exist.
Yah, well, they exist all right.
I'm sure they do - ha ha! But I can't read their serial numbers here. So if you could read me -
Well, but see, I don't have 'em in front a me - why don't I just fax you over a copy -
No, fax is no good, that's what I have and I can't read the darn thing -
Yah, okay, I'll have my girl send you over a copy, then.
Okay, because if I can't correlate this note with the specific vehicles, then I gotta call back that money -
Yah, how much money was that?
Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. See, I gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on.
Yah, no problem, I'll just fax that over to ya, then.
No, no, fax is -
I mean send it over. I'll shoot it right over to ya.
Okay.
Jerry Lundegaard.
All right, Jerry, you got this phone to yourself?
Well... yah.
Know who this is?
Well, yah, I got an idea. How's that Ciera workin' out for ya?
Circumstances have changed, Jerry.
Well, what do ya mean?
Things have changed. Circumstances, Jerry. Beyond the, uh... acts of God, force majeure..
Yah!
Jerome Lundegaard?
Yah!
This is Reilly Deifenbach at GMAC. Sir, I have not yet received those vehicle IDs you promised me.
Yah! I... those are in the mail.
Mr. Lundegaard, that very well may be. I must inform you, however, that absent the receipt of those numbers by tomorrow afternoon, I will have to refer this matter to our legal department.
Yah.
My patience is at an end.
Yah.
Good day, sir.
...Dad?
It's okay, Scotty.
Where're you going?
Yah, Shep Proudfoot said -
Shep said you'd be here at 7:30. What gives, man?
Shep said 8:30.
We been sitting here an hour. I've peed three times already.
I'm sure sorry. I - Shep told me 8:30. It was a mix-up, I guess.
Ya got the car?
Yah, you bet. It's in the lot there. Brand-new burnt umber Ciera.
Yeah, okay. Well, siddown then. I'm Carl Showalter and this is my associate Gaear Grimsrud.
Yah, how ya doin'. So, uh, we all set on this thing, then?
Sure, Jerry, we're all set. Why wouldn't we be?
...Dad?
Yah.
Stan Grossman called.
Yah, okay.
Twice.
Okay.
...Is everything okay?
Are you calling Stan?
Yah, pretty good.
Whatcha watchin' there?
Norstars.
...Who they playin'?
Wade, have ya had a chance to think about, uh, that deal I was talkin' about, those forty acres there on Wayzata?
You told me about it.
Yah, you said you'd have a think about it. I understand it's a lot of money -
A heck of a lot. What'd you say you were gonna put there?
lot. It's a limited -
I know it's a lot.
I mean a parking lot.
Yah, well, seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot - ha ha ha!
Yah, well, it's a chunk, but -
I thought you were gonna show it to Stan Grossman. He passes on this stuff before it gets kicked up to me.
Well, you know Stan'll say no dice. That's why you pay him. I'm asking you here, Wade. This could work out real good for me and Jean and Scotty -
How ya doin', Wade?
What's goin' on there?
Oh, nothing, Wade. How ya doin' there?
Stan Grossman looked at your proposal. Says it's pretty sweet.
No kiddin'?
We might be innarested.
No kiddin'! I'd need the cash pretty quick there. In order to close the deal.
Come by at 2:30 and we'll talk about it. If your numbers are right, Stan says its pretty sweet. Stan Grossman.
Yah.
Yah, thanks, Stan, it's a pretty -
What kind of finder's fee were you looking for?
Stan and I're okay.
Yah.
We're good to loan in.
Yah.
But we never talked about your fee for bringin' it to us.
You're sayin' that we put in all the money and you collect when it pays off?
What the heck were you thinkin'? Heck, if I'm only gettin' bank interest, I'd look for complete security. Heck, FDIC. I don't see nothin' like that here.
Yah, but I - okay, I would, I'd guarantee ya your money back.
- All's I know is, ya got a problem, ya call a professional!
No! They said no cops! They were darned clear on that, Wade! They said you call the cops and we -
Well, a course they're gonna say that! But where's my protection? They got Jean here! I give these sons a bitches a million dollars, where's my guarantee they're gonna let her go.
Well, they -
A million dollars is a lot a damn money! And there they are, they got my daughter!
Yah, but think this thing through here, Wade. Ya give 'em what they want, why wont' they let her go? You gotta listen to me on this one, Wade.
Heck, you don't know! You're just whistlin' Dixie here! I'm sayin', the cops, they can advise us on this! I'm sayin' call a professional!
You're darned tootin'!
... Stan, I'm thinkin' we should offer 'em half a million.
Dammit! I wanna be a part a this thing!
No, Wade! They were real clear! They said they'd call tomorrow, with instructions, and it's gonna be delivered by me alone!
All the more reason! I don't want you - with all due respect, Jerry - I don't want you mucking this up.
The heck d'ya mean?
They want my money, they can deal with me. Otherwise I'm goin' to a professional. He points at a briefcase.
...There's a million dollars here!
No, see -
Say, Shep, how ya doin' there?
Mm.
Say, ya know those two fellas ya put me in touch with, up there in Fargo?
Put you in touch with Grimsrud.
Well, yah, but he had a buddy there. He, uh -
Well, I don't vouch for him.
Well, that's okay, I just -
I vouch for Grimsrud. Who's his buddy?
Carl somethin'?
Never heard of him. Don't vouch for him.
Well, that's okay, he's a buddy of the guy ya vouched for, so I'm not worryin'. I just, I was wonderin', see, I gotta get in touch with 'em for, I might not need it anymore, sumpn's happenin', see -
Call 'em up.
Yah, well, see, I did that, and I haven't been able to get 'em, so I thought you maybe'd know an alternate number or what have ya.
Hiya, Lou.
Yah, thanks a bunch. So what's the deal, now? Gary says triple homicide?
Where is everybody?
Okay, so we got a state trooper pulls someone over, we got a shooting, and these folks drive by, and we got a high-speed pursuit, ends here, and this execution-type deal.
Yah.
I'd be very surprised if our suspect was from Brainerd.
Ya see something down there, Chief?
Uh - I just, I think I'm gonna barf.
Geez, you okay, Margie?
...Well, that passed.
Yah?
Yah. Now I'm hungry again.
You had breakfast yet, Margie?
Oh, yah. Norm made some eggs.
Yah? Well, what now, d'ya think?
There's two of 'em, Lou!
Yah?
Yah, this guy's smaller than his buddy.
How's it look, Marge?
Well, he's got his gun on his hip there, and he looks like a nice enough guy. It's a real shame.
Yah.
You haven't monkeyed with his car there, have ya?
Somebody shut his lights. I guess the little guy sat in there, waitin' for his buddy t'come back.
Yah, woulda been cold out here.
Heck, yah. Ya think, is Dave open yet?
You don't think he's mixed up in -
You look in his citation book?
...Last vehicle he wrote in was a tan Ciera at 2:18 a.m. Under the plate number he put DLR - I figure they stopped him or shot him before he could finish fillin' out the tag number.
Uh-huh.
So I got the state lookin' for a Ciera with a tag startin' DLR. They don't got no match yet.
I'm not sure I agree with you a hunnert percent on your policework, there, Lou.
Yah?
Yah, I think that vehicle there probly had dealer plates. DLR?
...Geez.
Yah. Say, Lou, ya hear the one about the guy who couldn't afford personalized plates, so he went and changed his name to J2L 4685?
Yah, that's a good one.
How we doin' on that vehicle?
No motels registered any tan Ciera last night. But the night before, two men checked into the Blue Ox registering a Ciera and leavin' the tag space blank.
Geez, that's a good lead. The Blue Ox, that's that trucker's joint out there on I-35?
Yah. Owner was on the desk then, said these two guys had company.
...You can sleep, hon. It's early yet.
Gotta go?
I'll fix ya some eggs.
That's okay, hon. I gotta run.
Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge. I'll fix ya some eggs.
Aw, you can sleep, hon.
...I'll fix ya some eggs.
Yah, yah, course I remember. How are ya? What time is it?
Oh, geez. It's quarter to eleven. I hope I dint wake you.
No, that's okay.
Yah, I'm down in the Twin Cities and I was just watching on TV about these shootings up in Brainerd, and I saw you on the news there.
Yah.
I thought, geez, is that Margie Olmstead? I can't believe it!
Yah, that's me.
Well, how the heck are ya?
Okay, ya know. Okay.
Yah?
Yah - how are you doon?
Oh, pretty good.
Heck, it's been such a long time, Mike. It's great to hear from ya.
Geez! You look great!
Yah - easy there - you do too! I'm expecting, ya know.
...What can I get ya?
...This is a nice place.
Yah, ya know it's the Radisson, so it's pretty good.
You're livin' in Edina, then?
Oh, yah, couple years now. It's actually Eden Prarie - that school district. So Chief Gunderson, then! So ya went and married Norm Son-of- a-Gunderson!
Oh, yah, a long time ago.
Great. What brings ya down - are ya down here on that homicide - if you're allowed, ya know, to discuss that?
Oh, yah, but there's not a heckuva lot to discuss. What about you, Mike? Are you married - you have kids?
...I was married to Linda Cooksey -
No, I - Mike - wyncha sit over there, I'd prefer that.
Huh? Oh, okay, I'm sorry.
No, just so I can see ya, ya know. Don't have to turn my neck.
Oh, sure, I unnerstand, I didn't mean to -
No, no, that's fine.
Yah, sorry, so I was married to Linda Cooksey - ya remember Linda? She was a year behind us.
I think I remember Linda, yah. She was - yah. So things didn't work out, huh?
And then I, and then I been workin' for Honeywell for a few years now.
Well, they're a good outfit.
Yah, if you're an engineer, yah, you could do a lot worse. Of course, it's not, uh, it's nothin' like your achievement.
It sounds like you're doin' really super.
Yah, well, I, uh... it's not that it didn't work out - Linda passed away. She, uh...
I'm sorry.
Yah, I, uh... She had leukemia, you know...
No, I didn't...
It was a tough, uh... it was a long - She fought real hard, Marge...
I'm sorry, Mike.
Better times.
I was so... I been so... and then I saw you on TV, and I remembered, ya know... I always liked you...
Well, I always liked you, Mike.
I always liked ya so much...
It's okay, Mike - Should we get together another time, ya think?
...I'm sorry... I shouldn't a done this... I thought we'd have a really terrific time, and now I've...
It's okay...
You were such a super lady... and then I... I been so lonely...
Nope.
Well, you do reside their at 1425 Fremont Terrace?
Yep.
Anyone else residing there?
Nope.
...Now, I know you've had some problems, struggling with the narcotics, some other entanglements, currently on parole -
So?
Well, associating with criminals, if you're the one they talked to, that right there would be a violation of your parole and would end with you back in Stillwater.
Uh-huh.
...I know you don't want to be an accessory to something like that.
Nope.
Hello?
Yah, is this Marge?
Yah?
Margie Olmstead?
...Well, yah. Who's this?
This is Mike Yanagita. Ya know - Mike Yanagita. Remember me?
...Hello?
No, I'm leavin' this mornin', back up to Brainerd.
Well, I'm sorry I won't see ya.
Mm. But ya think he's all right? saw him last night and he's -
What'd he say?
Well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' -
His wife?
Linda.
No.
Linda Cooksey?
No. No. No. They weren't - he, uh, he was bothering Linda for about, oh, for a good year. Really pestering her, wouldn't leave her alone.
So... they didn't...
No. No. They never married. Mike's had psychiatric problems.
Oh. Oh, my.
Yah, he - he's been struggling. He's living with his parents now.
Oh. Geez.
Yah, Linda's fine. You should call her.
His wife. This guy says she was kidnapped last Wednesday.
The day of our homicides.
And this guy is...
Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant.
Gustafson's accountant.
Yah.
But we still haven't found Gustafson.
- looking.
Sorry - didn't copy.
Still missing. We're looking.
Copy. And Lundegaard too.
Oh, I'm almost back - I'm driving around Moose Lake.
Oh. Gary's loudmouth.
Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?
Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.
Copy.
We've got a -
Whose car?
My car! My car! Tan Ciera!
...Chief Gunderson?
Copy. Yah, send me back-up!
Yes, ma'am. Are we the closest PD?
Thanks, hon. Time to shove off.
Hon?
Yah?
Yah.
Thanks, hon.
You bet. Thanks for lunch. What do we got here, Arbie's?
...How's the paintin' goin'?
Pretty good. Found out the Hautmans are entering a painting this year.
Aw, hon, you're better'n them.
They're real good.
They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.
Yah, okay. How's the hotel?
Oh, pretty good. They bitin'?
Yeah, couple a muskies. No pike yet. How d'you feel?
Oh, fine.
Not on your feet too much?
No, no.
You shouldn't be on your feet too much, you got weight you're not used too. How's the food down there?
Had dinner at a place called the King's Table. Buffet style. It was pretty darn good.
Was it reasonable?
Yah, not too bad. So it's nice up there?
They announced it?
...So?
Three-cent stamp.
Your mallard?
Yah.
It's just the three cent.
It's terrific!
Hautman's blue-winged teal got the twenty-nine cent. People don't much use the three-cent.
Oh, for Pete's - a course they do! Every time they raise the darned postage, people need the little stamps!
Yah.
When they're stuck with a bunch a the old ones!
Yah, I guess.
I love you, Margie.
Uh-huh.
We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.
And his wife?
She's visiting relatives in Florida. Now his boss, this guy Gustafson, he's also disappeared. Nobody at his office knows where he is.
Geez. Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. You call his home?
His wife's in the hospital, has been for a couple months. The big C.
Oh, my.
And this Shep Proudfoot character, he's a little darling. He's now wanted for assault and parole violation. He clobbered a neighbor of his last night and another person who could be one of your perps, and he's at large.
Boy, this thing is really... geez.
Well, they're all out on the wire. Well, you know...
This is do-able.
What the heck, Jerry, if I wanted bank interest on seven hunnert'n fifty thousand I'd go to Midwest Federal. Talk to Bill Diehl.
He's at Norstar.
I gotta tell ya, Wade, I'm leanin' to Jerry's viewpoint here.
Well -
I'm tellin' ya.
That wouldn't interest you.
Where's Tyler?
The first rule of Project --
What... ?
Get your hands off him! Get off...! What the hell do you think you're doing... ? Evidence?! This is a man... ! You killed him!
He was killed in action.
No! Look at you! You're... you're running around in ski masks, exploding things...
I need to know where Tyler is. Can't you help me?
Sir, you're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior.
There's no one else here.
I'm sorry, I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.
Look at my face. I'm a member. I just need to know if you've seen Tyler Durden.
You are a moron.
This was a support group for men with testicular cancer. The big moosie slobbering all over me was Bob.
We're still men.
Yes. We're men. Men is what we are.
Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed. Then hormone therapy. He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen. That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big.
Bob was a champion bodybuilder. You know that chest expansion program you see on TV? That was his idea.
...using steroids. I was a juicer. Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for racehorses, for Christsake. Now I'm bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids won't return my calls...
Cornelius! How are you?
Bob. I'm okay. How are you?
Better than I've ever been in my life.
No. I found something new.
Really, what's that?
The first rule is... you aren't supposed to talk about it...
Oh.
And the second rule about it is... you're not supposed to talk about it. And the third rule...
Bob, Bob... I'm a member.
You are?!
That's a fucking great, man! Fucking great! Congratulations.
Yeah, both of us.
I'm going to need you out-of-town a little more this week. We've got some "red-flags" to cover.
It must've been Tuesday. he was wearing his "cornflower-blue" tie.
You want me to de-prioritize my current reports until you advise of a status upgrade?
You need to make these your primary "action items."
He was full of pep. Must've had his grande latte enema.
After fight club, everything else in your life gets the volume turned down. You can deal with anything.
Have you finished those reports?
Is that your blood?
I must've left the original in the copy machine.
"The second rule of fight club... Is this yours?
Hmm?
You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.
"Abuse" the copy machine. There's an image.
We need to talk.
Okay. Where to begin? With your constant absenteeism? With your unpresentable appearance? You're up for review...
Let's pretend. You're the Department of Transportation, and you discover that our company intentionally did nothing about leather seats cured in third world countries with chemicals we know cause birth defects? Brake linings that fail after a thousand miles. Fuel injectors that burn people alive.
Just who the fuck do you think you are?! Get out! You're fired!
This is Detective Stern with the arson unit. We have some new information about the "incident" at your condo.
Yes?
I don't know if you're aware... your front door -- it seems someone sprayed freon into the lock, then tapped it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder.
No, I wasn't aware...
I am Jack's Cold Sweat.
Does this sound strange to you?
The dynamite...
Dynamite?
Yes. It left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride. Do you know what that means?
What does that mean?
It means it was homemade.
This is... really a shock...
Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion. The gas, it seems, was just a detonator.
Who do you think could've done this?
No. No, sir. I loved that condo. I loved every stick of furniture. The lamps, the chairs, the rugs, were me. The dishes were me. The plants were...
I'd like to thank the academy...
No, you can't die of insomnia.
Maybe I died already. Look at my face.
You need to lighten up.
Can't you give me something?
Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red Seconals.
I'm in pain.
We need to talk.
Sure.
I'm on to you. You're a faker. You aren't dying.
What?
And I saw you practicing this...
Practicing what?
Telling me off. Is it going as well as you hoped... ? "... Mr. Taylor."
I'll expose you.
Why are you doing this?
It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.
These are my groups. I was here first. I've been coming for a year.
A year? How'd you manage that?
I... I don't know. I guess... when people think you're dying, they really listen, instead...
-- Instead of just waiting for their turn to speak.
It becomes an addiction.
Look, I can't cry with a faker present.
Candy-stripe a cancer ward. It's not my problem.
We'll split up the week. You can have lymphoma, tuberculosis and --
You take tuberculosis. My smoking doesn't go over at all.
I think testicular cancer should be no contest.
Well, technically, I have more of a right to be there than you. You still have your balls.
You're kidding.
I'll take the parasites.
You can't have both parasites. You can take blood parasites --
I want brain parasites.
Okay. I'll take blood parasites and organic brain dementia --
I want that.
You can't have the whole brain!
So far, you have four and I only have two!
So, we each have three -- that's six. What about the seventh day? I want ascending bowel cancer.
That's your favorite, too? Tried to slip it by me, eh?
We'll split it. You get it the first and third Sunday of the month.
Looks like this is goodbye.
Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange numbers?
Should we?
In case we want to switch nights.
Where have you been the last few weeks?
How did you find me?
The forwarding number. I haven't seen you at any support groups.
That's the idea -- we split them.
You haven't been going to yours.
I found a new one.
Really?
It's for men.
Like testicular cancer?
Look, this is a bad time...
I've been going to debtor's anonymous. You want to see some truly fucked up people?
I'm just on my way out...
Picture yourself watching Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.
This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
This could go on for hours.
So you're staying in tonight?
What are you doing here?
What... ?
Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.
I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
Like sex crime victims, underwear inside-out, bound with electrical tape.
It's time for you to leave.
You're such a nutcase, I can't even begin to keep up.
What are you talking about?
Would you do something for me? I need you to check and see if there's a lump in my breast. I can't afford to throw money away on a doctor.
I don't know ...
Please.
This is a sweet side of you. Picking these up for ... "Mrs. Haniver" and... "Mrs. Raines." Where are they?
Tragically, they're dead. I'm alive and I'm in poverty. You want any?
No, thanks.
Where? Here?
Here.
There?
Here.
Here.
Feel anything?
Make sure.
Okay. Okay, I'm sure.
You feel nothing?
Well, that's a relief. Thank you.
No... no problem.
I think everything's okay here.
I could check your prostate.
Uh ... nah.
You... don't have to... leave.
Whatever.
Really... I mean it. Have you been going to your groups?
Chloe's dead.
When?
Do you care?
I don't know.
I don't understand. Why does a weak person have to go out and find a strong person... to hang onto?
You hear that?
Hear what?
That... sawing and hammering.
No.
What is this? Who did this?
... A person.
Guy or girl?
Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!
Why would you get bent if I asked?
Let go of me... Leave me alone.
The Paper Street Soap Company.
Can I come in?
He's not here.
What?
Yeah?
Marla, it's me. Have we... have we ever had sex?
What kind of stupid question is that?!
Because the answer's "yes" or because the answer's "no?"
Is this a trick?
Will you just answer me, for Christsake?!
You mean, you want to know if I think we were just having sex or making love?
We did make love?
Is that what you're calling it?
Answer the question!
You fuck me, then snub me. You love me, you hate me. You show me your sensitive side, then you turn into a total asshole! Is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship, Tyler?
We've just lost cabin pressure.
What did you say... ?
What is wrong with you?
Say my name.
What... ?
Say my name! What's my name!?
Tyler Durden! Tyler Durden, you fucking freak. What's going on? I'm coming over there...
Marla...
Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom. I thought they were going to break my arm.
I'm sorry, I...
The were burning their fingertips with lye. The stink was unbelievable.
Marla... I need to talk to you. It's going to take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out.
I don't want to hear anything you've got to say.
Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.
Absolutely, you have every right. I need you to do me a favor.
Because... I'm Tyler Durden.
You got about thirty seconds.
I know that I've been... unwell. I know it's been like there's two sides to me.
Two sides? You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass.
I deserve that. Anyway, I've... I've only just realized
What?
I mean, the depth and breadth of our relationship has only recently been illuminated for me. I know this... I know us hasn't been such a great thing for you...
I'm trying to tell you -- and this is where you have to trust me -- but, I think your life might be in real danger.
What?
You have to get out of here. Leave as soon as possible. Go to any rural town, away from any major city...
You are an insane person.
Marla...
There's a part of you I really like, but I can't do this anymore. I just can't. This is killing me...
I'm sorry, but I...
Let go of me!
Leave me alone! I don't ever want to see you again!
Tyler...
Why are you doing this?
I'm not paying this back. I consider it "asshole tax."
What happened... ?
My God, you're shot...
Who did this to you?
Hello?
Who's this?
Tyler?
Who's this?
Uh... I'm sorry. We met on the plane. We had the same briefcase. I'm... you know, the clever guy.
Oh, yeah.
I just called a second ago. There was no answer. I'm at a payphone.
I star-sixty-nined you. I never pick up my phone. What's up?
... and you come home to this.
How have you been?
... You know me?
Is this a test, sir?
Yes... it's a test.
You were in here last Thursday night.
What?
You were standing right where you are now, asking how good our security is. It's tight as a drum.
Who do you think I am?
You're the one who did this to me. You're Mr. Durden, sir. Tyler Durden.
Throwers don't worry about ticking. Modern bombs don't tick.
Excuse me? "Throwers?"
Baggage handlers. But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
My suitcase was vibrating?
I had everything in that bag. My C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes...
Tonight, we're going to open the green door -- the heart chakra...
I wasn't really dying, I wasn't host to cancer or parasites; I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around.
-- But, in here, in everyone, there's the squint of a five-day headache. Yet they forced themselves to be positive. They never said "parasite;" they said "agent." They always talked about getting better.
If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla. Marla...the little scratch on the roof of your mouth that would heal if only you could stop tonguing it, but you can't.
Tell the other person how you feel.
One minute. This is the beginning. We're at ground zero. Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
It's getting exciting now.
We have front row seats for this Theater of Mass Destruction. The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of ten buildings with blasting gelatin. In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges, and those buildings will be reduced to smoldering rubble. I know this because Tyler knows this.
Look what we've accomplised. Thirty seconds.
Two, equal parts gasoline and diet cola. Three, dissolve kitty-litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick.
This is how I met --
You know why they have oxygen masks on planes?
No, supply oxygen?
What do you do, Tyler?
What do you want me to do?
I mean -- for a living.
You see, when you travel, everything is small, self-contained--
The spork. I get it. You're very clever.
Thank you.
How's that working out for you?
What?
Being clever.
Well, uh... great.
You buy furniture. You tell yourself: this is the last sofa I'll ever need. No matter what else happens, I've got the sofa issue handled. Then, the right set of dishes. The right dinette.
I guess so.
And, now it's gone.
Could be worse. A woman could cut off your penis while you're asleep and toss it out the window of a moving car.
There's always that.
I don't know, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
...no ...no ...
But maybe, just maybe, you've been delivered.
Delivered from Swedish furniture.
Delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns.
Delivered from Martha Stewart.
Insurance'll cover it.
Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
What list?
The "now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again" list. That list.
I don't... think so.
This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You'll be occupied for weeks.
Well, I have to file a claim...
The things you own, they end up owning you.
Don't I?
Do what you like.
God, it's late. I should find a hotel...
A hotel?
Yeah.
So, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you... go find a hotel?
I don't follow...
We're on our third pitcher of beer. Just ask me.
Huh?
You called me so you could have a place to stay.
No, I...
Why don't you cut the shit and ask if you can stay at my place?
Would that be a problem?
Is it a problem for you to ask?
Can I stay at your place?
Yes, you can.
Thank you.
You're welcome. But, I want you to do me one favor.
What's that?
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
What?
They're called "cigarette burns."
It's called a "changeover." The movie goes on, and nobody in the audience has any idea.
Why would anyone want this shitty job?
It affords him other interesting opportunities.
-- Like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films.
One-forty-eighth of a second. That's how long it's up there.
No one really knows that they've seen it. But they did.
A nice, big cock.
He was the guerrilla terrorist of the food service industry.
... Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
He farted on meringue; he sneezed on braised endive; and, with creme of mushroom soup, well...
Go ahead. Say it.
I don't know about this.
I don't know, either. I want to find out. I've never been hit, have you?
No. That's a good thing, isn't it?
I don't want to die without any scars. How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight? Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
Why not you? I'm letting you go first. Do it.
This is crazy.
Alright, go crazy. Let 'er rip.
Where do you want it? In the face?
Shit. Sorry. That didn't count.
How do you feel?
Strange.
But a good strange.
Is it?
We've crossed the threshold. You want to call it off?
Call what off?
The fight.
What fight?
If you could fight anyone... one on one, whoever you wanted, who would you fight?
Anyone?
My boss, probably. Who would you fight?
Oh, yeah. I didn't know my dad. Well, I knew him, till I was six. He went and married another woman, had more kids. Every six years or so he'd do it again -- new city, new family.
He was setting up franchises. My father never went to college, so it was really important that I go.
I know that.
After I graduated, I called him long distance and asked, "Now what?" He said, "Get a job." When I turned twenty-five, I called him and asked, "Now what?" He said, "I don't know. Get married."
Same here.
Where's your car?
What car?
The previous occupant had been a bit of a shut-in.
Hum.
What?
"I am Joe's Lungs." It's written in first person. "Without me, Joe could not take in oxygen to feed his red blood cells." There's a whole series -- "I am Joe's Prostate."
What are you reading?
Soldier of Fortune. Business Week. New Republic.
A guy came to fight club for the first time, his ass was a wad of cookie dough. After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood.
If you could fight any celebrity?
Alive or dead?
Doesn't matter.
Hemingway. You?
Fight club became the reason to cut your hair short and trim your fingernails.
Any historical figure.
Okay... Ghandi.
Good answer.
You?
Unbelievable, huh?
I mean, this girl... uh, you're not into her or anything... ?
You're sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
You're okay with this?
She is a wild, twisted bitch. Stay away from that one.
Oh, and my pace is more librarians.
Hey... don't knock librarians.
Marla doesn't need a lover. She needs a case worker.
She needs an exorcist. This isn't love. This is sport-fucking.
She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home.
What?
If you ever say anything about me or about what happens here in this house, to her or anyone -- I will find out. And you'll never see me again. Promise me.
Okay.
Promise you won't.
Yes, I promise.
Promise?
I said I promise!
You want to finish her off?
Huh?
"The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception."
You get rid of her.
What is this place?
As the fat renders, the tallow floats to the surface. Remember the crap they taught you in Boy Scouts.
Hard to imagine you in Boy Scouts.
Tyler's kiss was a bonfire on the back of my hand.
Look at your hand.
Stop it. This is your pain -- your burning hand. It's right here. Look at it.
I... I think I understand. I think I get it...
This is the greatest moment of your life and you're off somewhere, missing it.
No, I'm not...
Shut up. Our fathers were our models for God. And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God?
Listen to me. You have to consider the possibility that God doesn't like you, he never wanted you. In all probability, He hates you. This is not the worst thing that can happen...
It isn't... ?
We don't need him...
... Marla ... ?
No thanks, I quit.
You quit?
Yeah. Where you headed?
What... ?
Six months advance pay. Six months!
Fucking sweet.
There's fight club in Delaware City.
Local 8 just started in Penns Grove. And, Bob said he was at fight club in Newcastle last week.
Newcastle? Did you start that one?
What are we doing?
Homework assignment.
Tyler...
I asked you what you studied.
I feel sick.
Hey.
Where did you go, Psycho-Boy?
Something on your mind?
Why wasn't I told about "Project Mayhem?"
What should I have told you?
Why wasn't I involved from the beginning? You and I started fight club together.
Is this a needlepoint club? Is it about you and me?
You know what I mean.
What do you want? A statement of purpose... ?
Look...
Should I E-mail you? Should I put this on your "action item list?"
I want to know --
This does not belong to us. We are not the leaders. We are not special.
What are you doing?!
We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world. We are all part of the same compost heap...
What the hell ... ?!
You choose your level of involvement. I won't make decisions for you.
I'm not asking you to.
You're asking questions that don't have answers. You know just as much about Project Mayhem as anybody else.
I don't know! Nothing!
If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?
I want to hear the truth.
Fuck my life. Fuck fight club. Fuck you and fuck Marla. I'm sick of this. How's that?
Why do you think I blew up your condo?
What?
What are you talking about?
This conversation...
... is over.
You're too young. Sorry.
"Too young?"
If the applicant is young, we tell him he's too young. Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
"Applicant?"
If the applicant waits at the door for three days without food, shelter or encouragement, then he can enter and begin training.
Four in Milwaukee.
What's this all about, Tyler?
And, we're definitely filling a void in the rural South.
Why do people think I'm you?
You broke your promise. You talked to her about me.
Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?
Why did you do that?
Answer me, Tyler.
Why do people think anything?
People think that you're me, because you and I happen to share the same body.
What... ?
Is this really news to you?
What are you talking about... ?
The first rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club.
He's not here! Tyler's not here anymore! He's gone away!
Oh, yeah. I didn't really know my Dad...
There! Happy? I asked for one thing from you... one simple promise. Now look what you've done!
This isn't possible...
We're going to have to do something about Marla...
What... what are you saying?
No! This isn't true. We... we were around other people, together, both of us...
You never talked to me in front of anyone else.
Wrong, wrong -- what about the car crash... the two guys in the backseat?
What about them? They're lunatics.
You took me to the house.
The house is rented in your name.
You have jobs.
Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.
What about Marla?
What about Marla?
She's... you... you're fucking her.
You could be standing under 37 stories of steel and concrete with a 150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped to the support... oh, maybe it couldn't be...
You... you can't be serious about this.
What a ridiculous thing to say.
I can't let you...
...go through with this? What are you going to do?
I'm going to...
...stop me?
I'm not going...
...to let this happen!
Stop finishing...
What are you doing running through the streets in your underpants? We both use that body.
Since when is Project Mayhem about murder?
The buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago. Everything's proceeding exactly as planned.
I wouldn't be doing that. Unless you know which wires, in what order...
If I'm wrong, we're both dead..
I'm pulling the green wire.
Yes...
Don't pull the green wire. Pull anything but the green wire.
Fuck you.
I've got everything. The bombs. The army. I've got Marla.
Bob was a grown man. In any great struggle, there will be casualties. Wouldn't that be implicit in the name? Project "Mayhem."
Fuck your struggle. I want out.
You want out?
I quit.
Tyler...
What?
Ask me nicely.
Defuse the bomb, please.
Defuse the bomb?
One minute.
I think this is about where we came in.
This is the beginning. We're at ground zero. Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
Can't you call it off... ?
It's out of our hands. This is it.
Please...
What the fuck -- ?
Paraffin.
What?
Damn it! God-damn it...
Not exactly according to plan.
NO...
How'd you do that?! You're a fucking figment of my imagination... you're psychogenic fugue state...
Why... why... why... ?
Why what?
Why can't I get rid of you? Why can't I just wish you away?
You need me.
No, no, I don't. I thank you, I really do. Thank you, but I don't need you anymore.
Look, I can be selfish, I know that. I'm not blind to my own failings...
From now on, we'll share Marla. We've been spending too much time apart...
... no, no, no...
No more running off without you. From here on out, we do it together.
Why are you doing this?!
I'm doing this for us.
Please understand... I've gotten all I can from this, Tyler.
If I leave, you will be right back where I found you...
I swear on my life, I won't...
What are you doing?
What have you left for me?
Why do you want to do that? Why do you want to put that gun in your mouth?
Why are you going with this, Ikea- boy?
Do something for me.
What?
Appreciate something.
What?
Look at me...
What?
Who is this?
Maintenance.
Listen, something is going to happen, something terrible...
Very good, Sir.
Excuse me?
Don't worry about us, sir. We're solid.
Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
You told me you'd say that.
Abort the plan.
You told me you'd say that, too.
Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?!
It's what he would have wanted, sir.
What he wanted? Look... look at him. Look at him! What does he want? This is a person. This is not a cog in your machine...
But, this is Project Mayhem.
No, no. This is a man -- this man has a name...
But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
No! Wrong! This man's name is Robert Paulson.
Robert Paulson?
His name is Robert Paulson!
Who told you motherfuckers you could use my place?
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
He don't own this place, I do. How much money's he getting for this?
There is no money.
Really?
It's free to all.
Ain't that something?
Yes, it is.
Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone outta here now!
You're welcome to join our club.
Did you hear what I just said?!
What are you doing?!
Pleeeeeease!
Okay! Okay, fuck it! Use the basement! Get off me!
We need some towels, Lou. We need replacement light bulbs.
Alright, Christ! Fucking let me go!
Thank you. Thank you, sir...
Raymond K. Hessel. 1320 SE Benning, apartment A. A small, cramped basement apartment.
How'd you know?
Is this a picture of Mom and Dad?
Yesssss...
Your mom and dad will have to call kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up your dental records, because there won't be much left of your face.
S-S-Stuff.
Biology, mostly.
Why?
I... I don't know...
Animals.
Yeah ... animals and s-s-s ---
Stuff. That means you have to get more schooling.
Would you rather be dead?
Kimberly Burroughs, eh? What do you want?
I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.
Yeah, how?
I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up... I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.
It's not just about me. Someone I saved died last night in a freak accident. What if the others are in danger, too?
Well, if you put them on the list, they're already tits up.
What list?
The survivors of Flight 180 died in the exact order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash. That was Death's original design.
Officer Burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends.
Congratufuckinglations. That makes you last to go. But don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you. Always does.
That's good. Get all your tears out now, you'll need your eyes. For the signs.
Signs?
If you have the same power as Alex, you'll be seeing signs soon. When you see anything creepy or ominous, an in-your-face irony kinda thing? Don't ignore it. It usually means the difference between life and death.
The songs on the radio. But wait. I don't understand. Why is this even happening to me?
I didn't beat it; I hid from it. If you were smart you'd put a down payment on a burial plot and say goodbye to the dog, because what little life you have left is over as you know it. Don't make new friends, don't fall in love, and don't ever bother trying to save others. That's the worst killer of them all.
The second one just dies. A 16 year old kid.
You have to tell us now.
I was driving a white van. It must've gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and I drowned. It was...horrible.
You were there?
I can practically taste the water in my throat. And something else. The smell of flowers...
Please, what else could it mean?
So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby.
What about that?
What are you doing? You're going to kill us!
No. If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me. But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive. I'm last on Death's list.
Are you crazy? What makes you think you'd survive?
What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
Six duds in a row.
This makes no sense. Isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake. Could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested?
What did you see? What am I looking for?
Another premonition?
What do you want me to do?
Speed up.
What did you see?
No! It can't be.
A mortician. He seemed to know a hell of a lot more about death than he ever told us.
Should we knock?
Remember the onramp? There was a pregnant woman in a white delivery van.
Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight.
Here we go. The vehicle's a delivery van registered to Jorge and Isabella Cruz. And Christ, there's almost a dozen domestic disturbance complaints on these two.
Then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect Eugene and Isabella for as long as we can.
A guard grabbed me before I could find Eugene.
Don't sweat it. It's over.
Jury duty? That's randomly selected by social security numbers.
Random, sure.
Um, Clear? I'm sorry...about before. I...
I'm not sure I understand.
So if you never got off the plane, none of us would be alive in the first place.
The only reason he was on Route 18 was because he own the lottery and had to collect the winnings.
That lucky bastard.
I had tickets to go, but one day I'm in Paris, trippin' on acid, sippin' lattes an' such, and this dude gets whacked by a falling sign.
Carter.
Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. 'Course, missed the show...
Dano, shouldn't we go back and help your mother?
Calm down, Kimmy. It's not drugs, just weed.
A Trans Am. That shit went out with New Kids on the Block.
Yeah. Who does he think he is? Knight Rider?
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
Tell me you didn't start up on that Flight 180 shit again. Did you?
Look, you weren't there. It was weird. She knew that log truck was gonna cause an accident, she knew. Never mind.
You've made your point.
Good. Cause we just got some new info and I don't need you getting freaky on me.
What?
What do you mean "grand theft auto?" This is insane.
Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday morning.
Damn, they always stick me with the clunker.
Please. It's not going to wait.
I've got to stop and help those people.
What?
Are you Jorge Cruz?
Maybe. What's this about?
May we come in?
We had a fight. Some things got broken, the dog went crazy, she left me. Wouldn't say where she was going.
What was the fight about?
Take a guess.
Does she have a cell phone? A way we can contact her?
First I'm stuck with Jury Duty, now this nonsense.
This can't be happening. My career's at a peak, I finally met a cute guy, I just bought a new house...
Last July I dialed a wrong number and got a radio station by accident. They asked me what number means "good luck" in Jewish.
Eighteen. And it's "Hebrew".
Here's what I don't get. For nine months, Death does all this shit to make sure I win these tickets and end up on Route 18 at exactly the right time for the pile up...
Yeah?
I got that beat. So like, last May, I was supposed to stay at this cheesy bed and breakfast in Pennsylvania. There was a major gas leak no one knew about and all the guests suffocated during the night.
Yeah, so what happened?
What's going on here?
THAT's the truck that's going to kill everyone!
Alright miss, calm down. I just need this lane open. I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder!
Tell me again how it started.
Like I said, it was like I was there. I remember everything. The sounds of the crashes, the smells, the look on Shaina's face...
Do you remember what triggered it all?
Billboards about accidents. Kids yelling "pile up" for no reason. It all felt...just wrong. Just like...
You mean Alex Browning.
I tried calling last night but your father --
I know. I've gotten calls all morning from everyone who was on the onramp. We're all meeting at my apartment tonight.
I didn't. Until I was dispatched to clean up one of the Flight 180 survivors.
Pigeons... It's a sign! If Clear's right about the order, then Nora and Tim are going to be attacked by Pigeons!
I'm not following you --
Turn around. The cleaning woman said they're at the dentist's. 14th and Main.
Nora's not coming. She refuses to leave her son.
We have to tell her she's in danger!
This is cheery.
New life defeats death? Follow the signs? Where the hell did you find that guy?
It throws the entire Death list out of whack. And a new list has to be rewritten from scratch. We all start over with a clean slate.
Shit, I don't have her number. She was never interviewed. She took off right after the accident.
How are we going to find her? There must be thousands of white vans in this state.
Whoa, nine months?
Guys, let's not panic. Isabella's safe.
How do you know?
Stop it, don't move him!
Um, Kimberly? This is a neighborhood. You may wanna slow it down.
Don't worry. Nothing can happen to us.
Kalarjian?
Shouldn't we pull over?
Are you okay? You just face planted!
But it's over. Isabella's baby was the key. You saw her die and everything, right?
I don't...what if I made a mistake?
I'm not sure... I don't think Isabella was ever destined to die in the pile- up.
You can't cheat destiny. I know what I have to do to save us. I have to die.
Welcome back. We did it. For real.
For God's sake, leave him alone, Dad.
Want me to drive?
This trip better be worth it. What's the guy-girl ratio again?
Get ready to smile, five guys per girl.
What's the chance of finding a nice mature guy once we get to Daytona?
What is it? What are you?
What is it? What are you?
Relax, you need to chill the fuck out.
Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell.
More than that. All the songs on the radio were about car crashes. Some kid's banging toy cars together. She was dialing her cell phone with her headset on. His car was leaking oil all over the road.
The best way to get to Yankee Stadium is Route 18.
Can I ask you a question?
Sure.
When I die. Is it gonna hurt?
And you're gonna die after me, right?
I guess so.
Thanks, Dad. I'll call you.
You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
Relax, Dad. It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
I know this is the first time we've been apart since. But everything's gonna be okay.
Your mother would have been so proud of the way you've handled yourself through all of this...
Kimberly? It's Dad.
Your car's leaking either transmission or brake fluid. I want you to have it checked ASAP at a gas station.
You got it, Dad. I'll call you if I have a problem.
I mean it. Take care of it.
I know it's crazy, but I'm really scared for the others. I've got this terrible feeling.
What feeling?
I'm sorry. I'm just so happy that you're safe.
There were so many times I didn't think I could last another day. I can't even tell you some of the things I thought about.
I used to have those feelings, too. But that's when I'd think of Mom. Her strength...and courage. And I'd pray that maybe I'd grow up to be as brave as she was. And the bad thoughts would go away.
Damn, it really hurts, Mom.
What on Earth are they doing?
You're all certifiable, you know that? I can't believe I've been listening to this crap. Come on, Tim, let's go outside.
Mom?
Yeah?
You think the tooth fairy's gonna come tonight? I'm thinkin' like fifteen bucks.
How would I know? You think I'm some sort of...
It's only the end of June.
You went there? I've wanted to go there, but I thought it was off limits.
Not a likeness. It's how you make me feel, Alex.
I'm... really sorry.
That's why I was there last night.
I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere.
"It?"
Is that something you're "feeling?"
I don't know. I wish I could just see him... one more time, then, maybe... I would know.
This place?!
That... him?
I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson?
Ahhh! fuck! You fucking asshole. You think this is funny, you fucking dick? Tod, if you're not dead I'm gonna fucking kill you!
He said Death has a design. Even before he said that I had been seeing patterns.
How many died on Flight 180? From our group?
Thirty-nine.
No.
Remember the departure time?
4:25.
Right. April 25th.
I'm not just layin' down a bunch of math here, with this. I'm talking about indications... omens... that day, that we were meant to die. That, if, we have been aware of... would have saved everyone on the plane.
I don't understand... did you see Tod die? Did it happen again, like on the plane?
No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design.
Most kids do, I guess.
Those guys are probably fifteen minutes away.
No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe.
I can't go home. After Lewton's, they'll be after me.
Billy told the F.B.I. he saw you runnin' away from her house.
Stop the car!
Can't you open the door?!
Carter, get out!
Get out! Get out of the car! Get out of the fuckin' car!
Police are coming.
You know what to do.
No! No! Don't!
I'll remove him.
You're payin' for my trip, Browning!
Hope you don't think, Browning, that because my name ain't on this wall... that I owe you anything.
I don't.
We're losing our favorite teacher.
Alright, Browning, you fuckin' warlock... did you know about Ms. Lewton, or what?
Is knowing going to make it easier? It makes it harder.
You get off havin' control over me. Let me choose how to deal with it.
What's your fuckin' worry? If it's not your time...? I could get nailed runnin' this red light and you all wouldn't get shit! Only me, right?
You should have been next. After Lewton, you should've been next. That's the only pattern. You should be dead.
You're the fuckin' devil.
My intervention in the death of 180 survivors will cheat the design.
"Intervention?" What are you, God now?!
Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay.
Fag.
C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
And then the cabin banged and the left side exploded. The the whole plane... blew up. It was so real. Exactly how everything goes.
Me, too. But my dad doesn't understand. When he's better; you and me, road trip to the City. Catch the Yanks.
I got this... feeling... a weird feeling... I can't explain it...
Did you take any sedatives before boarding, or on the plane. Sleeping pills?
I believe that... Ms. Lewton's next.
"Next?"
Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
Alex... can you promise me that no one else will die?
I'm... a friend of his. His best friend. See, his father...
Cuticle lacerations.
His father's pretty fucked up with denial. Maybe he couldn't deal with the thought of an other accident... taking another son.
... there are no accidents. No coincidencess. No mishaps. And no... escapes.
You may not realize it, but we're all just a mouse that a cat has by its tail. Every single move we make, from the mundane to the monumental... the red light we stop at, or run; the people we have sex with, or won't with us; the airplane we ride, or walk out of... is all a part of Death's sadistic design leading
I'm sorry we broke in.
And don't pass on the right.
Billy! I'm gettin' a vision! You're the next one...
Hey, man, why'd you say that?!
Please tell me I'm gonna get to see the Jets win the Super Bowl.
Shoulda' felt up Tammy in the pool, that time...
It broke!
What are you doing?
So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now?
He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.
Knock it off!
May as well go out under my own free will, right?
Get control of yourself!
That's what I'm doin'!
I know what you're doing! It's alright to be scared, Carter. You don't have to prove to us how big your balls are. Not now.
SHUT UP, BILLY!
You guys are real... aren't you?
Huh?
Sorry, I mean... I talk to people all the time... I know a lot of them aren't there. But this is real, isn't it? You're taking me home now?
I gotta tell you, it's just luck you guys came when you did. They move us around a lot... We only been at that camp a week. Got a smoke?
No.
You mean the snake?
Yeah. It's not hard once you get the hang of it. In the wrist. Anyway, I did what I always do when I get one...
What's that?
Wow!
Your buddy made it out last night. The place went apeshit.
Really? How come he didn't take me?
Maybe because you're shot in the leg.
Hell. This is just like fucking Star Wars, man!
... and there's this guy with a black helmet and cape, right, and he's got this sword... except it's not a sword, it's light...
This clown almost blew mission security on the street. I'm not jumping with him.
Ever do this from a jet?
Again.
Insertion. Call in to base camp by TRANSAT. Proceed to point Tango November for rendezvous with our ground contact. Indigenous agent. Co Phuong Bao. We've been over this three times.
Co Phuong Bao. The guide takes us twelve klicks upriver to target at Ban... at Ban... Bo Peep. Shit!
... to target at Ban Kia Na. We probe the site...
Ninety.
... then proceed downriver to extraction at point Echo Delta. Doyle takes us out by helicopter, we all live happily ever after and that's the last time, Rambo! I swear to Christ.
Gettin' old, huh?
No radio source. Nothing for the bad guys to triangulate on.
Show me how it operates.
That's what I'm here for.
Show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land.
Yeah. Why not?
You read me, Brewer?
Read you.
You okay?
What do you call that?
Modified M-16 A2 and over-under M-79 grenade launcher, with Sionics sound suppressor, Tracor starlight scope and LAC/R-100 Laser sighting system.
Batteries not included.
What's this?
Cocktail party. Uh huh, right. Let's saddle up.
That's it? Some C-4, a map and a knife?
And a beat-to-shit AK? Every twelve-year-old in Nam's got one of those.
You wanna know why I stood up for this show?
No.
I was in the brig. They gave me a deal. I blew up this Colonel's golf cart with an M-19. He wasn't in it or anything... it was the symbolic value. Seemed like a good idea at the time.
That's a real good reason to wind up in 'Nam.
I've seen worse places.
This place is a trip.
Buddhist monastery. Fifteenth century.
You fucking crazy? I need it to burn these things off.
No cigarettes.
What's this stuff on the rice?
Why would they send us to a deserted camp?
We'll check it out.
How come we didn't just drop near the camp... save this hassle?
Brewer. Does a jet make noise?
What's she saying?
She likes you. Says you're dinky- dau.
What's that?
Powerful warrior.
These guys look like they'd sell their mothers.
Sometimes they do. They're river pirates. Opium runners.
How you doing, Brewer?
Snoring. Five, six guys. Mumbling... Vietnamese. Somebody talking in his sleep. A toilet flushing.
It's a guy in a cage.
American?
Can't tell. Pretty tall. He's real scrunched up in that thing.
Roundeye.
Alright. Home run.
Torture cage. Can't stand... can't sit... for days. Sometimes weeks.
That guy's not going to make it.
I'm getting him out.
What? Are you crazy? We're supposed to take pictures and split. You're gonna blow the whole program.
You never been in one of those things.
It's orders! You remember... when they tell you to do something and then you do it. John Wayne is dead, man.
You better take off.
Are they going to torture us?
Yes.
Gawd, you look awful.
You comin'?
Can you handle the door gun?
Brewer! You know what that thing's packing?
It's a Soviet MIL MI-24. Probably has 12.7mm nose cannon, heat-seeking rockets and wire guided missiles, plus...
You're gonna love it.
I'm Rambo. This is Brewer. Her name is Co.
You really got a Masters Degree?
How do we get upriver?
I have arranged transportation. We meet soon. But I think you to be disappointed.
Why's that?
Where did you find this clown?
I thought he was with you.
How did you get started working for the spooks?
Spooks?
Intelligence work.
Nguyen. He twelve now. Not see him for eight years.
Where's Nguyen now? What city?
Huntington Beach, California.
It's nice there. He's probably digging every minute. Got a surfboard. Breaking girls' hearts.
Are you okay?
Yes. But I lose many merits in next life. Very bad.
Why'd they want us?
Thanks.
Rambo. NVA coming. Pig dog Kinh say meet them here. Whole garrison from Con Cuong is out.
Christ. How'd you get here?
And how'd you sneak up like that?
Carefully. Don't want to get shot by you. Bad karma. Anyway, you need me.
I do?
You think you are... .
Invulnerable.
You try get across Laos? Get to Thailand?
Yeah. Got some business there. What are you gonna do?
Go United States. See Nguyen. Maybe teach economics. Buy Cadillac. Watch "Dynasty."
How you going to get there? You can't trust the spooks to pull you out. They'll use you up and throw you away.
I know. I go with you.
Yes you can.
Look, Co...
What was that?
John. My name is John.
Alternate LZ Zulu Sierra at 0500. It says "May have heat. Don't be late. All our love."
Stay on your heading, Captain.
Sorry, Sir. Can't do it.
That's an order.
You pathetic scum.
I don't work with spooks. Not after that op in Cambodia.
I'm authorized to get you out of here. I thought that's what you wanted.
What's the job?
Classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out. Two men. Two days.
Why me?
We like you. At least the computer at Langley likes you. Pulled your file because of various factors. Service record. Area familiarity.
Where?
Not yet.
Memo E-7 on top will cover the details. An abandoned Vietnamese Army base in the North-central highlands may have a compound used as an internment camp. As you can see the intelligence is soft. These LANDSAT photos show huts... barracks. It could be anything.
What's the plan?
This operation is in two phases. Recon and rescue. You are phase one. Your two-man team will probe the site, confirm the presence of American POWs, if any, make photographic and tactical observations, then proceed to the extraction point without engaging the enemy.
We don't try to pull out any of our guys if we find them?
Negative. Absolutely not. The phase two assault team will get them out.
We just take pictures?
I didn't know you were a stick man, Rambo.
All this is for us?
He's giving them a run for their money. Says here they've got two Hueys from Danang. I didn't know those dinks had Hueys.
Half their air force is our stuff. Captured.
Typical...
Sir, there's something else... a TRANSAT relay. Just came through.
Um... actually, no. It looks like he shot down one of their gunships...
Christ almighty.
... and then he, uh... took the other one.
What?
How long have you been setting up?
About 22 hours on site.
How long before you're fully on line?
You think they'll find any?
POWs? I don't know. But either way it'll get that subcommittee off our necks. Cream?
Black. No sugar.
What's up?
Listen, Kirkhill. I'm a bit of a fifth wheel in your setup here... I thought I'd go out with the extraction team tonight. Unless you have an objection.
It's not necessary.
I know.
I know...
Take your time.
Look, Colonel... we're all adults here. This is a war. A very quiet, very intense war. People get sacrificed.
But you're right... some people do get sacrificed. Now tell me why you pulled the plug.
You think I'm some whacko? I like to hurt people? I'm doing a job here. If I knew what's right or wrong I'd be a goddamned priest, right? So I follow directives... I do what I'm told. It's simple. If your boy had done what he was told, there wouldn't be a problem.
Look, it was a screw-up, alright? They weren't supposed to find anything. We thought that camp was empty.
This mission was a scam from the word go?
Rambo and Brewer were selected as write-offs.
It was clean. Very clean... Rambo was a decorated Vietnam vet, a former POW himself... if he came out and said "No POWs" the sub-committee would buy it. He gets himself caught he's a private citizen, a whacko, acting on his own. If he gets proof, it gets lost somewhere between here and D.C. Airtight. But no... Rambo's gotta be a hero. Thinks he's
"Terminate with extreme prejudice."
So there never was a Phase Two rescue team?
You're out of your depth, Trautman. Way out. I'm acting correctly here. Not you. Not your gung-ho jungle ace. It's over. Walk away.
It's not over. You made one mistake.
Who're you?
American. Come to get you out.
Man, you are one scary-looking motherfucker!
Can you walk?
What's your name?
Hello, John.
Colonel.
I hear you're not enjoying it here.
Seems like I'm always pulling you out of some goddamn toilet or other, doesn't it?
Am I out of here?
That depends on you. Christ, look at you. I give you this easy duty until I can get you an assignment... all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas... and you have to make it Rambo's last stand.
There were treating me like a headcase.
This your stuff?
Hardcore outfit. The best I ever trained.
Those men are all dead.
Congressional Medal of Honor.
Yeah. Big time.
Plus, what else? Two Silver Stars, four Bronze Stars, two Soldier's Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry and... uh, a handful of Purple Hearts.
Five. I never wanted that stuff.
What did you want?
I just wanted... I don't know... after all that... I just wanted one person, one person, to come up to me and say "you did good, John." And mean it. That's all. After all that.
We left some people behind there, John... POWs.
Listen up. You two are married as of now. Get used to it.
Let's do it.
Keep it clean, Rambo, or I'll nail your hide to the shed.
This will last you one year after which you have the option to renew if... you like at a membership discount.
But now it's free, right?
You know, I think I... ordered some just the other day.
Well did you or didn't you?
Yes! They'll be in soon.
I like your nails. Where did you get them done?
I've never been in an apartment above a store. You always pass them on the street but you never think anyone really lives in them.
Can I get you anything...coffee... tea...a little tequilla?
Will it hurt?
...So he says to me, "you'll never find another man like me"...I said, "please, men like you have one hand on their dicks and the other hand on their mother's leg... I said, there's the door - take a trip.
My parents were divorced.
...SO...anybody special in your life?
Well, don't say it like that. It's not so...ya know, crazy an idea. You are a healthy woman... You hold a steady job. Ya not crossed eyed or anything...
Well, there's nobody special!
Fine.
I mean, it's not easy in this day and age.
What?
Meeting ... people.
Tell me about it. I've been dating longer than I've been driving. I can't believe that.
I never really...went through a... dating period.
...My mother calls every week. Like a recurring nightmare. "So, have you met anyone?"..."No mom".. "So what's going to happen?"... "I don't know Mom"... I only thank God I moved out.
I can't believe you lived with her for that long. If I had to live with my mother, I'd stab myself six times.
I think some people are meant to be alone. Maybe I was a man in a former life and I used women for pleasure so now I'm paying for it - which would be fine, if I could just remember some of the pleasure parts...
I don't understand you. What is the problem?
I don't feel like I make any impression on people... At office parties I spend my time re-arranging the hors d'oeuvres as people eat them, so the platters will always look full. I don't start conversations because I have no idea how to end them...I think I'm just meant to live in the background of things.
That's not true...You gotta ease up... Conversations have a life of their own. You gotta just go with it...We're having a lovely conversation.
You know, let me tell you something! I'm not that kind of person. I don't do people favors. If I talk to you it's because I want to. So we're not all ...uh...Jerri Hall...Big deal... What a boring world if we were. You do the best you can with what you got. You're not so so invisible, ya know... You want make an impression?
Really?
Oh, no..I have to get home...
No really..I can't.
Getting your nails done is one thing but going to dinner with a bunch of strangers and <u>him</u>... She didn't even look at him.
I mean, I've gone out with bums, but they were gorgeous. It's the only reason to go out with a bum.
This food's delicious. You're a wonderful cook. And you have a lovely home.
<u>You're surprised</u>!... But I guess I just never met the right guy. Whatta gonna do?
I'm shocked. With a child bearing body like yours... ... why a man would have to be out of his mind!
Most men are.
Holdin' my penis... What a lovely way of sayin' how Much ya like me...
Yep! Right on it!
Are you in a mood today baby? Is this one of those days when you're in ...whadda call it... an emotional abyss? Talk to me, cause I don't understand these moods.
Anne, they're MY moods. If you want to understand moods, have one of your own!
Well, it's funny! Whatta want from me?
It's not funny. It's... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb.
Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
It happens to be a beautiful love story. Ya know, you used to like that about me. You used to say you liked that I didn't make you think so much. That we could be together and not think...
I'm sorry.
I can't tell you how distraught I was. All night long. What the hell happened?
I was attacked.
<u>What</u>!
Two kids tried to set me on fire.
You were attacked. My God. Should I call a doctor! Did you call the police...
No, I'm fine... really...
... So... where did you sleep last night?
I... I stayed at a friend's. Listen, I --
I'm not seeing anyone else. I really was attacked.
Oh, I used to be such a Catholic.
You still believe in God?
... You have a little... uh... something on your face...
I tell you something, Anne. I really feel like I'm cursed.
Oh stop. Things will change. My Aunt Mary always said, there's a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class.
I get this feeling like I'm... a magnet but I attract shit. Out of all the people in this city, why did I meet a man who's wife I killed?
You didn't kill anybody. Stop.
Can I have my desk please.
Hello, I'd like to speak to Lydia?
Lydia?! Lydia who!?
I don't know her last name... I'll be off in a second.
You're calling <u>Lydia</u> in <u>my</u> office. You must think I'm some dope. You fuckin' bastard... You... ... stay out all night long...
What... No... Lydia... I want to speak to... her name is Lydia... I...uh...
... I don't get a friggin' phone call. You stroll in here at noon. I got... two people out sick. Ya think I need this? I Do Not Need This!
I was not with a woman last night. I was out with Parry.
The moron?
He's not a moron.
And who's Lydia?
Lydia is the girl Parry likes... And I thought, if I could get them together I...
What? The curse'll be lifted? <u>Will</u> <u>you please</u>!
I... You're not going to understand this.
Don't treat me like I'm stupid. It pisses me off.
All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.
What does that mean?
See, I told you!
Well, what the hell does that mean?
Hello....congratulations.
I don't know... He's a little disgusting... Although some women go for that.
Well talk back. He won't bite you.
What are you two up to?
What do you think?
You know, I can't believe I did it. You think it'll work out?
Who's knows. My Aunt Marge used to say, "some matches are made in heaven, some are made in hell and some are made in hardware stores".
Nothing it's just...I begining to understand you.
Well...I think you should feel very proud. You did a real nice thing for somebody else. I'm very proud.
So what's going on? Who's Lou again?
My agent. I called my agent.
You're kidding! What did he say?
He says if I want to get back to work, no problem. He wants me to come in and talk and... and... <u>that's</u> <u>it</u>!
I've got to put these tapes in some kind of order... and... Oh, I should get my sports jacket cleaned... ... There's coffee if you want...
It's so great to see you like this, honey... I can't tell you.
Thanks.
Ugh, these tapes are a mess. I don't know where to begin...
... What?... You don't want to commute?
What?
"I'm an incredible woman?" What is this, a death sentence?
No, I... I think we should talk about this.
You want to talk? Come on, Jack... Did I cross the line by mentioning the future or what?
... Listen, so much has happened and I think it would be a good thing for both of us if we slowed things down a little.
Slowed things down? Where have I been? Have we been going fast!?
... I'd like to focus on my career - - now than I can, now that everything's all right... Parry's taken care of... and... Like I said, I feel like I know a lot more now and I don't...
First of all, let me tell you something -- you don't know shit. Second of all, as far as <u>we</u> go, what time do you need? What have we been doing here, except <u>time</u>? Have I ever... ever pressured you!?
No.
You can't even give me that?! What were you gonna do, Jack?... Just gonna organize your life... ... walk out that door, move in by yourself and what -- drop the news when you find somebody else? What were you planning to do, Jack?
I didn't know. I just said all I want is some time.
Bullshit! If you're going to hurt me, you hurt me now -- not some long... drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you don't have the balls!
What have you been doing here! <u>Huh</u>! <u>I wanna know</u>! <u>What have you been</u> <u>doing here</u>?!
<u>Listen</u>! We both got something out of it, all right!
Oh yeah? What did I get? What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week? You think your company is such a treat? Your moods, your... "pain", your problems... You think you're entertaining?
Well! What do you want me to do - applaud?
How have you been?
I think.. I...I realized...I love you.
Parry?
He can't hear you. Hi...I'm Dr. Weintraub.... I was on duty when they brought him in...I've been going over his record... He was brought in once before I understand... ..."catatonic stupor"...condition rendered him non-verbal for a period of -...
Yeah so? The guy's beat up - he...he probably has a concussion or something, right? He'll snap out of it?
I'm afraid not ... Then again, I'm not sure. The beating's bad but it's not the problem... It seems he's.. re-experiencing the catatonia... So, like before, he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years... ....I don't know. There's no way to tell.
But..How could that happen?
Well, it's not unusual in his case... Sometimes victims of tragedies are subject to the brain's replay system. The brain never loses anything - it just stores it up and waits. A person could actually re-experience the full effect of a tragedy, long after the event took place. Are you relatives? Well, it doesn't matter. We'll take care of it. He'll have to be
What if I was a relative?
So, Edwin, baby, this is Sunrise Confession time... what have you got for us?
Yeah, I know the place. It's one of those chic <u>yuppie</u> gathering holes.
Yeah, but does she swallow, Edwin?
I think she likes me... she gave me her number, but she must work a lot cause when I call she's never home... But I think we'll go out this weekend... I've...
No, Jack, no, it's not... She likes me.
She gave you the old brusheroo, kiddo... Believe me -- this tart will never make it to your desert plate...
Where you comin' from?!
Uh... basement I think...
You a friend of Parry's?
No... He is supposed to live there?
Yeah, well... I let him stay there. What else could I do after such a tragedy?
Tragedy?
Can I help you?
I'm... just looking for Parry...
I wanna go...Just let me go...
Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
A real nice place I know... Ah...can't get there! Not tonight.
Where? Maybe we can.
No...no...we can't...we can't..
Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?
Can you tell me something? Did you lose your mind all of a sudden or was it a slow gradual process?
Um...I've got to run. I've bee doing this all day. Are you going to be all right?
Remember. One chorus and out.
It's O.K...It's O.K...Lets me help you up.
NO...I WANNA GO! I WANNA GO NOW!
Come on now...You can't sit here.
Isn't that awful? Poor Brenda Frazier. Poor Little Gloria. They ruined them! THEY ATE THEM ALIVE!
It was a crime.
You shouldn't hang around this neighborhood.
I... I was just leaving.
People spend a lot of hard earned money for this neighborhood. It's not fair... looking out their windows to see your ass asleep on the streets...
Yes... I... I agree...
.....Me neither.
Can I ask that when you clean your hands you wipe the ink off the inside of the sink before it stains the stainless steel.
About dinner as a concept or about dinner with... <u>Raoul</u>?
You're so witty. I'm so jealous... I <u>need</u> to get out of here, Jack, and do something other than sit in this apartment and count how many funny lines you have per page.
You know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... It would be nice if you acted like you understood.
Fine. I'll say no.
They're putting me on film tomorrow.
Fine.
... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body. Do you know what that means? What this could lead to?
Jack, it's a sitcom -- you're not defining Pi.
I'll remember that the next time you get excited by drawing pubic hairs on raisin bran. Want some?
No, I have to work.
How un-sixties of you.
I was nine in the sixties.
Hello Lydia?
Yes.
Yes well... You are a credit card holder, are you not?
Huh-huh.
Well, congratulations Lydia, because out of several thousand card holders... in conjunction with several major credit card companies...
Which ones?
Your name was picked.
Well, I don't understand. What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?
A list.
Well -- were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what?
Well there.... What's the difference?
Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR.
You get a VCR with the membership. ... For a short time until you get your own. Listen, why don't you come down to the store and you can check it out. See if you're interested.
Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?
Hello. My name is Lydia Sinclair.
So how do we do this?
Now what?
Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
Free?
You know, Anne does other people too. Sort of a sideline...
How much?
Okay... twenty dollars... When can you...
Could you help me-- what was the name of that girl who just came in...
What girl? I didn't notice.
Oh, Lydia!
Lydia. Lydia what?
God, I have no idea. She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea. I'll call her.
Please don't hurt me?
I need a drink.
This is it. I'm in hell. Damned to an eternity of idiotic conversation.
Have I died?
Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
Where am I?
My abode... My domicile... My neck of the woods... Hungry? Breakfast? A fruit pie perhaps?
No... thanks... Listen --
My name is Parry.
Hi... Where are my shoes?
They're -- -- What?
Where -- ?
<u>What</u>!?
<u>What</u>?!
Do you know what the Little People just told me?
The Little People?
They said you're The One.
I'm the one what?
... I've got a right to say something. I mean, you're tying my hands here! They say you're not ready to know.
... Do you know who I am?
Uhh... I'm drawing a blank.
Uh... gee... well... you seem to be some kind of vigilante...
No, no... I mean that sort of happens along the way but no... I'm on a very special quest.
A quest?
But I need help and <u>they</u> sent you.
The Little...
They work for Him.
Him...?
The Holy Grail? Some billionaire has the Holy Grail sitting in a commode on Madison Avenue?
I know! You can't imagine how surprised I was. Who would think you could find anything divine on the Upper East Side.
I think you're a very nice... very nice psychotic man. I really appreciate what you did for me. It was a very brave and noble thing...
Oh, please... you're embarrassing me.
I wish you all the luck in the world. When you get the Grail, I'm sure I'll be seeing lots of you on various talk shows...
See, you don't know him... That's why you're the one... You can get it...
Listen, forget the shoes. I'll just take a cab... Uh...
Parry.
Parry... I'm Jack.
Thanks... You can keep the doll.
I'm not married.
"Soveriegn princess of his captive heart what dire affliction has thou made me suffer, thus banished from thy presence with reproach, and fettered by thy rigorous command, not to appear again before thy beautiful face. Deign princess, to remember this thy faithful slave, who now endures such misery for love of thee"....
Do you follow her every day?
Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten.
What's her name?
Why did you do that?
Here...I just would like to help you. I thought...maybe...you could use some money.
Here's another twenty. Will that do? I mean, what's it going to take!
That's O.K.
Can I take you to lunch?
Well, I think you should be realistic. Ya can't start an ad agency on fifty dollars!
But I gave it to you!
Well what am I gonna do with it?
I don't know. But I gave it to you...to help YOU...not him.
Pretty impressive huh?...Don't let it scare you. I'll admit it's formidable but everything has it's weakness.
You can't just break into Langdon Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing.
O.K...let me explain this one more time...The Holly Grail is in -....
All right! Listen - please...don't start drooling or...rolling your eyes when I tell you this but - You shouldn't do this..There is no Holy Grail.
Of course there is, Jack. What do you think the Crusades were - a frat initiation? I don't think so...There has to be a Grail.
Look, you're only sort of insane, really. People like you can lead semi-normal lives. You could get a job...
I don't need a job. I have a quest.
I take it back - you're fucking deranged... And you're going to get yourself killed trying to get in there!
Tch. You are so sweet...Now I know why you're saying this. ...You're afraid I'm in danger and you're trying to protect me.
...You are such a great guy. First the money, now this. Isn't he fabulous!?
Please don't hug me in public again, O.K.?
Will you shut-up!!!
You're a true <u>friend</u>.
I'm not. Believe me. <u>I'm</u> scum.
You're a real honest to goodness <u>good</u> guy.
I'm self-centered, I'm weak - I don't have the will power of a <u>fly</u> on shit...
That's why the Little People sent you. Just <u>like</u> magic.
I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!
So what? You going to help me?
He knows who you are! He's afraid! I can tell!
Isn't it great up here... He's gone now, but we had him on the run! We would've had his ass if we had horses! He's running scared!
SAW WHO!!?
The Red Knight!
Parry...
Listen, he just needs to sleep it off. Someone will take care of him.
Who?
It's such a great song.
Don't you think it's time to go now? Running around here during the day is one thing but at night we could be killed by a wide variety of people.
Well that's stupid. This is my park just as much as it is theirs. You think it's fair they keep us out just because they make us think we'll get killed or something?
.....What are you doing?
You can't do this! This is New York! Nobody lies in naked in a field in New York..It's...it's too Midwestern.
Come on, try it. Ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella's flappin' in the breeze. ...everybody in the city is busy with their business and no one knows we're bare assed in the middle of it. Come on!
..Ha...Little fella? I mean the man talks to invisible people - he sees invisible horses - and he's naked in the middle of Central Park. I should be surprised? I'm not surprised. I'm fucking outta my mind to even be here!
Who are you talking to Jack?
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!
Are there any questions?
What?
I can't ask for her...I have to earn her.
Parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. It's the twentieth century.
Maybe, when we get the Grail...
Well, see, I think she can help...You know women are great..they...they make homes and they..ya know, kill the livestock so the knights can go out and get Grails and...and slaughter villages with a clear head...I mean, where would Arthur be without Guinevere...
Happily married, probably.
Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
Holdin' my penis...
Will you stand still so I can do this!
I'm sorry....I'm just so excited. You must have felt this way when you first met Anne, huh? Where did you two meet?
In a bar called Hellfire.
Tch...how romantic. Yeah. If I wasn't already committed to Lydia, boy. Except Anne'd never go for me though. She loves you too much. And you really love her, huh?
No. But that's not the only reason people get together or..stay together.
...I feel so much for her...I feel like something awful is going to happen.
No. Nothing bad's going to happen. Anne'll be there. I'll be there. Nothing bad will happen.
Parry, it's Lydia Sinclair - our membership winner.
Beautiful night huh?
Unhand that degenerate - you adolescent ass of a one balled donkey!
It's just a bum...You know, there's enough in here for the two of you.
You a fag too?
<u>Fag..a</u> <u>fag</u> <u>you</u> <u>say!?</u>... <u>"Curst</u> <u>wolf!</u> <u>Thy</u> <u>fury</u> <u>inward</u> <u>on</u> <u>thyself</u> <u>Pray</u> <u>and</u> <u>consume</u> <u>thee!"</u>
OWWW....What are you nuts?!
I advise you to let us go.
You advise us!
Come on! Go for it! What the hell are they gonna do? They can't do nothin!
Are you all right?
You can't leave me tied up out here alone, you fucking faggot!
Parry Parry?
No just Parry.
How about the "Hell Merchants"?
I don't like horror movies!
How about... Zbiegnew Speizak's "The Purple Bread," an intensely portrayed tale of love and envy set against the sweeping background of a Polish bakery. In subtitles.
I don't like... uh... Polish love stories... ... I like musicals.
Well, we have plenty of those. Right over here. We got the MGM series, Astaire and Rogers, the Judy Garlands...
... Uh... we seem to be all out of Ethel Merman.
What a gyp.
...I..uh..I get to read some of the books but mostly I..just calculate production costs from first edition hard cover publication to paperback. After paperback it's basically someone else's problem.
It sounds exciting.
We mostly publish trashy romance novels.
How do you know him?
What do you do - for a living I mean?
Tell me more. I want to know everything.
There isn't any more to tell.
Don't say that.
No, really..believe me - there isn't any more. This is it.
Well, it's enough for me.
You don't have to say that.
I never say anything I have to.
I mean you don't have to say nice things to me... That kind of thing is a little old fashioned for what we're about to do.
What are we about to do?
Well... you're walking me home. I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...
I don't drink coffee...
... and then we'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll... then you'll sleep over and then in the morning... ... you'll be distant and you won't be... able to stay for breakfast... you'll just have some coffee maybe...
I don't drink coffee...
Excuse me...
Listen, I'm not feeling well.
Well, no wonder. We just met, made love and broke up all in the space of thirty seconds and I can't even remember the first kiss which is the best part.
Listen, you're very nice... b...
So are you, but I think maybe you should shut up now... ... I'm not coming up to your apartment. That was never my idea.
Oh... You mean you don't want to.
Oh no, I want to. I've got a hard-on for you the size of Canada... but I don't... want just one night. I have a confession to make?
You're married.
No.
Divorced.
No, I...
You have a disease.
... It's not just from tonight. I've known you for a long time. I see you come out of work every day. I walk with you to lunch. I know what you order... I see you buy Baby Ruths before going back in... I know how you feel on certain days by whether or not you go into the bookstore... ... I know you
See, I told you it was him... Your name's Donnie something, right?
I leave it to you.
My name is Shirley, but they call me Betty, and her name's Twinky.
Twinky?
Yeah, 'cause she's so "twinky"...
Well, Betty and Twinky, it sure is nice talking to you girls. I just wish I had more time...
That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
A wig?
Yeah, I told her it was you, but that you're wearing a wig, 'cause on TV you're mostly bald in the front.
We gotta get on home an' relieve the sitter. Why'nt you an' Ray come on over.
Give 'em the horn, Bob.
Well, id'n that nice.
If you're sayin' you're somethin' better'n what I am, that's one thing. But I can't say much a someone who'd run off an' leave a woman in a situation like this an' feel easy about it. An' that's all I gotta say.
Tell me what in the hell's going on, Elton!
You're not going to play it again.
Well, lemme play the other side then.
Now quit, Bobby. You said you're goin' a help me pick a song.
You said.
How 'bout if I just cut off your damn water?
Sugar, you know how I feel about you, don't you? I'm just tryin' to get you to take an interest in my kind a things, an' what I'm tryin' to do with myself... You know, there id'n anything in the world I wouldn't do for you, baby. I started livin' the day I found you, you know that?
Cerveza.
Serveza yourself!
Now, now.
Why'nt you take 'at sign off your tit, Ray, an' let's go on out.
I'll go out with you, or I'll stay here, and do anything you'd like for me to do... if you'll just do one thing. If you'll tell me that you love me.
You can sing the song.
You know what, you are never satisfied.
I'm tryin', baby, so don't start gettin' mad now.
Is it my turn again?
I can't help it, honey, the ball just keeps goin' cocky wobbly on me...
Will you just do what the hell I tell you...
I did, didn' I, El?
That was damn good, wad'n it? I finally did it...
Come on. We're goin' over to Elton's.
I'm not.
You just going to sit there?
Yes.
Okay. Hope no one hits on you.
Come on, DiPesto. We can still have a good time.
You're the pathetic one, not me.
I'm going on over there...
I'm not some piece a crap.
I know you're not.
You treat me like I was.
I'm sorry.
You go slippin' around in front a my face, an' in front a Elton an' Stoney. What do you imagine they think a someone you treat that way...
Elton and Stoney know how I feel about you. An' they're just goin' to think I'm not too nice a guy, which I'm not, an' that you're a hell of a person puttin' up with me, that's all.
You're goin' a find me dead one time.
Sssh, come on now... Be a good girl.
If you really want a get up an' leave me, you can read about it in the newsprint.
I'm not going to get up an' leave you. Now let's go over to El's an' have a good time.
I'll be gone two or three weeks.
You like it?
I love it.
"Every trail that you blaze/Makes me..."
What?
Just one minute, you! Don't you ever talk to me like that!
Are you depressed about your daddy, honey?
No.
I 'magine it's me then, id'n it?
Is what you?
You're depressed that I come along.
Who said I was depressed?
'Cause if it was me, I could just catch a Greyhound back.
Why can't I go out to your folks' house? Give me one good reason.
So how long am I supposed to sit an' twiddle my thumbs in this place?
If you can't do what I ask, Ray, use that money to go back home, then.
Okay, Ray...
Or maybe sit out by the pool an' get myself nice an' tan for you. Would you like that?
Sure...
It brings out my eyes...
Bye, honey, I'll call you in a couple of days.
This certainly is an improvement on the motel an' the coffee shop. How could you have left such a beautiful place, Bobby?
Rayette.
What?
Just finish eating.
It's all right. He don't mean anything by that.
Bobby...
Come on.
Wait a sec. I want Tita to take a picture of you an' me in front of the place...
I'm gonna go in that cafe an' get some coffee. You want anything?
No.
Sure you don't want anything?
Look at my car! Piece of shit! I just bought it brand new from a used-car lot, and the steering goes to the pot on me!
You're lucky no one was hurt.
What's your name?
How far are you going to?
Washington.
We'll get off in Washington and hook another ride.
Where are you going?
Alaska.
You don't have to tell everybody about it. Pretty soon they'll all go there and it won't be so clean.
How do you know it's clean?
I saw a picture of it. Alaska is very clean. It appeared to look very white to me... Don't you think?
I had to leave this place. I got depressed, seeing all the crap. And the thing is, they're making more crap, you know? They've got so many stores and stuff and junk full of crap, I can't believe it.
Who?
Well...
Hey, mack!
Fantastic! That you could figure all that out, and lay that down on her, to come up with a way you could get your toast.
I didn't get it, did I?
Can I get you anything else?
No. How much do I owe you?
No substitutions.
What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?
No. We have tomatoes.
But I can't have any. Is that what you mean?
Only what's on the menu... A Number Two: Plain omelette. It comes with cottage fries and rolls.
I know what it comes with, but that's not what I want.
Wait, I've made up my mind. I want a plain omelette, forget the tomatoes, don't put potatoes on the plate, and give me a side of wheat toast and a cup of coffee.
I'm sorry, we don't have side orders of toast. I can give you an English muffin or a coffee roll.
What do you mean, you don't have side orders of toast? You make sandwiches, don't you?
I don't make the rules.
One Number Two, and a chicken sal san -- hold the butter, the mayo, the lettuce -- and a cup of coffee... Anything else?
Now all you have to do is hold the chicken, bring me the toast, charge me for the sandwich, and you haven't broken any rules.
You want me to hold the chicken.
Wasn't it, ladies?
We been wantin' to ask you something. Are you the guy on YV?
Am I on TV?
She says you're the one that sells all the cars on TV.
I'm gonna give you our number, Donnie, just in case... We're both professionals, if you didn't guess.
Well, you seem very professional...
Tea.
Oh my goodness... Bobby...
Robert Eroica...
Now don't...
No, I'm not... I'm not.
I just can't look at you.
You always do this to me.
Well, I don't mean to. Here's your tea, Tita.
Sorry.
This is a very special, very old CB 275...
Oh.
You know who it once belonged to?
No.
Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar.
Robert...
Very nice.
I have to talk seriously with you...
Everybody still up on the Island?
Well, Herbert's mostly on the mainland because of the orchestra, so at the moment, there's just Daddy, Carl and myself... and Van Oost.
Who's Van Oost?
Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.
Carl's a fiddler. What's he doing coaching piano?
It's not funny. He permanently sprained his neck, and since then it's been extremely difficult for him to tuck the violin.
Crashes into a Jeep and totals his neck. That's Carl...
Robert, I have to tell you something...
What?
Daddy's very ill.
Oh, well, what, what's he...
He's not... They feel he... maybe he might not recover, and that he'll either...
Yeah... I guess so...
I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me?
I'd rather drive up myself and... maybe go into Canada after... And I can't stay long, Tita, probably a week, at the most.
Well... I better let you...
Maybe you better stay, then.
No, I need to talk to you, about so many things...
Oh God, I'm so glad, Robert, that you're coming...
Yeah, me, too...
It'll be so good for you, and for Daddy, because you know, you've never really...
Tita, I've got to go...
Well, I really appreciate it, Carl.
How long have you been staying here?
He has ways of communicating, Robert. I can tell when he's expressing approval or disapproval, just from his eyes...
Uhm hmm. Some range.
It's not that bad.
Yes, it is. I can't take seeing him, sitting there like a stone.
I mean, you think I'm that happy?
No, I don't. You should've left a long time ago.
What questions?
Well, do you -- I mean, have you enjoyed all these... strange things you've been doing?
Why? Am I some kind of freak to you or something?
No, no, I don't think that, I'm just curious about it... Do you think I'm a freak?
Oh no... Why? What is it? The way I look?
No, I don't really think you're a freak.
I probably am, but I don't care. I mean, I wasn't that blessed to begin with, and when would I have had time to make any improvements...
What about Carl and Catherine? Is he just coaching her, or what?
Constantly. Night and day. And unless I get up before the birds, I can't get in any practice time for myself...
Uhm hmm.
Actually, it's very admirable, the way she works. She'll probably be enormously successful, because she's attractive as well, not that that's so important in music, but...
You're attractive, Tita. If you just did a little more with yourself...
Like what?
Well, if you just maybe did something with your hair, or...
Oh, let's not talk about my hair, it does what it wants to, and anyway, who cares, I want to talk about you...
Well, you're not going to run out on me right away, are you?
Do you want some gingerbread?
What?
With applesauce?
Look at that.
Why are you being so mean?
I don't think I'd notice. I'm so used to Carl.
I think he's got a terrific personality.
Look, can't you see that, what I'm talking about?
Where is she, anyway?
It's none of your business!
Where's Catherine?!
I'm talking to you, Tita!
You're leaving?
Yeah. I said a week, and I've overstayed myself...
You were going without saying goodbye?
I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.
But what about me?
Bye, now.
What have you been doing since then?
What have I been doing? Different things, different jobs, here and there. Nothing that interesting.
Hello...
I guess you fell in the water.
Yes, intentionally.
That's dangerous, you know.
Swimming?
I love to swim, and I don't mind the cold at all. It's invigorating.
Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.
Why?
Besides piano and swimming, what else do you do?
Well, there's fishing and boating. There's concerts on the mainland and... but I feel silly telling you. This is really your home. You probably know better than I what there is to do.
Nothing.
Nothing? Then it must be very boring for you here.
That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
Right now I'm going to run a hot tub and soak myself.
After that, I plan to read some music and rest for awhile.
Tomorrow, then.
Carl has hydrotherapy on Tuesdays.
The day after tomorrow.
If you're free.
One thing that's hard to understand is how you could have this incredible background in music, and then just walk away from it, without a second thought...
I mean, how could you not play anymore? That's so strange to me...
I have played a few times. Here and there. As a matter of fact, I was once a rehearsal pianist for a Las Vegas musical revue.
You don't call that music, though.
That was beautiful, Robert. I'm surprised...
Thank you.
Is that funny?
It wasn't supposed to be, it just struck me that way.
Why?
Nothing. It's just that... I picked the easiest piece I could remember. I think I first played it when I was 8 years old and I played it better then.
It doesn't matter. It was the feeling I was affected by.
I didn't have any.
You had no inner feeling?
None.
Wait...
Well, at least you're accomplished at something...
What?
Catherine...
You think I'm a fake.
I think it's what you think.
No, it isn't what I think.
Yes, it was. You've made it clear that if I can cut a little piano, I might get a little response.
I don't think that's accurate...
Up to now, what I've been getting from you are meaningful looks over the dinner table and a lot of vague suggestions about the day after tomorrow...
It's convenient to fake looking for something right now, isn't it?
I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...
I don't find your language that charming.
It's direct, anyway, which seems to be difficult for you.
Serious, that's what's important to you?
No, don't do that...
No inner feeling.
That's right.
I married him when I was 17. He was a cellist, and I thought he was the most brilliant man I'd ever met... And I'm sure he was, because at that age, I hadn't met that many... But he was insidious, you know. He had me convinced that I was a mediocrity, musically, as a woman, as an intellect. But in this completely imperceptible,
That's what you said?
As a matter of fact, he's the one who introduced me to Carl... How are you?
I'm fine.
Carl restored my confidence. He really did. He's much more substantial than you give him credit for.
Is he?
Do you think you could discreetly move across the hall now?
Robert?
What?
I could spend some time with you tomorrow morning, before Carl comes back, I mean, if you'd like to.
Where are you going?
I'm going to pick up some friends of Carl's. Are you all right?
I have to talk to you.
No, I want to talk to you now. I have to explain something about...
No, you don't have to, it isn't necessary...
No, I can't...
Will you let me talk to you, please?
I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that.
Oh. You have to tell me that.
I'm sorry everything's been so confusing, but I have to go, Robert...
Catherine...
No. It's useless, Robert. It wouldn't work, not ever...
Just give me a chance, will you?
And living out here, in this rest home asylum, that's what you want?
Yes.
That'll make you happy.
Four or five years.
Did you hear about my misfortune, Robert?
What?
She's tremendously gifted, this girl.
I hope you feel at home, Robert. I'm really glad you're here.
Robert, do you mind?
What?
You sure you should be playing, Carl?
I'm not aware of it. Like what?
I've walked across a stage a number of times, without exciting any particular response...
See? There's nothing wrong with the way I walk. Now where are we?
That's three games to none, Carl.
All right, let's have a rematch.
Oh, for chrissakes...
Robert, I think you better just...
Come on, get moving, dammit!!
Haven't you got a jacket or anything with you?
No, I don't, I uh... it got burned up. Everything in the car got the shit burned out of it. All I got left is what I have on...
I've got an extra jacket behind the seat, if you want to put it on.
No, it's okay.
Suit yourself. But I'll tell you, where we're headed is gonna get colder'n hell.
You've been staying in a motel all this time?
For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. Can
I don't understand why you had to stay in a motel. There's more than enough room here.
Well, I was goin' to, but Bobby said he hadda kind of feel things up here first, which I can understand, but then it went an' took so long, I ran flat outa money... I didn't have no number to call, you know. So I hadda clear outa there an' come on up here, in the hopes that I wouldn't be intrudin' myself...
Oh, no. You're more than welcome.
Well, thank you, that's a very nice thing for you to say.
No, you're not. Go ahead and take your time.
What kind of doggy is that?
It's a Borzoi.
Oh no, it's been much more than that.
Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.
I don't think that's true.
It is true.
You know, just after I came back off tour with the Betenthaller Quartet, Dad, myself and Herbert had a summit conference about you...
Oh, my, "a summit conference." I wonder where I was, polishing silver behind the coal bin.
I don't know where you were, penis envy.
I hope I didn't hear that.
What's wrong, Carl, you hardly ate anything...
And what about love?
What about it? Wouldn't you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love?
No, I wouldn't.
... which should exclude you from any objective discussion. But keep in mind, even the arts aren't free of aggressive content, nor the institution of marriage.
But I'd like to say, so that I don't dampen the spirit of your adventure...
You haven't dampened my spirit, Samia... Excuse me.
Come on, Terry, we got a ride!
There'd never be a hole big enough. Now took at me, for instance, when I was just one person, before Bobby, I had so much garbage collectin' onto me every day, I was thinkin' about gettin a dispose all...
Well...
Hey, follow that truck. They know the best places to stop.
That's an old maid's tale.
Salesmen and cops are the ones. If you'd ever waitressed, honey, you'd know.
Don't call me "honey," mack.
Don't call me "mack," honey.
I wouldn't be a waitress. They're nasty and full of crap.
You better hold onto your tongue!
Mass production is what does it.
What do you mean "mass"... I have to come out and tell you, you're not that clean, either.
Wait a minute. I'm not that neat, maybe, but I am clean.
Well, you're not that bad, but some people... I mean, people's homes, just filth. I've been in people's homes...
In my personal observation, I think that more people are neat than are clean...
In my personal thing, I don't see that. I'm seeing more filth. A lot of filth. What they need to do every day, no, once in a while, is a cockroach thing, where they spray the homes. And uh... can you imagine, if their doors were painted a pretty color, and they had a pot outside, with...
Yeah, it could be adorable...
And you know, I read where they invented this car that runs on... that runs on... when you boil water...
Steam.
John believes in the basic goodness of man, and that's fine, but gaze into the pit like I have and that view seems a little soporific. And not unlike television, it hardly represents the real world...
There's some good things on it, though.
Pardon me?
The TV. There's some good things on it, sometimes.
The choice of words, "squashed flat," juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten...
Well, she was.
Miss Dupea.
I'd like to remind you again, this isn't an opera or a musical comedy.
Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?
If you want to call it that.
Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all.
That's exactly what I am doing, again.
Do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first? This is tiring me.
I have a suggestion. Why don't we take a break.
Don't fuck wit' me! Don't fuck wit' me. My lawyer's so good he'll have you workin in Alaska, so dress warn.
Aaron, how you doin'?
Fine.
Look at me.
What?
Why you have an attitude for?
Not now, I'm busy
God, I just wanna speak to you. I just wanna speak to you the way I feel about you.
Please don't scream at me. I like you, but I don't like the way your attitude is.
I wanna go out with you, I want to be part of your life. I want you to treat me the way a girlfriend should be treated.
Then don't go out with me.
For once in your life have some respect for me, don't even curse at me or nothin'.
Now she's tellin' me what the fuck to do.
God, you drive me crazy. I just want you to know how I feel and you don't understand.
Alright, tell me, what'd you hear?
There's a rumor that you were tryin' to get somebody to beat me up.
What chu listening to rumors for? I'm not like dat.
I told you, no. I'm not that type.
Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop.
Who are you?
Do you have a name?
Victor.
What?
Wussup?
Yo.
Hi.
Remember me, from the pool?
So watcha doin'?
Nothin'.
What are you doin' here?
I, umm, came to see you.
You know somebody around here?
No. What you do today?
Oh you know, cleaned the house, cooked. Took care of my little sisters. Sit down. So where's Carlos?
Whadja wanna see me about?
So you got a girl?
Of course.
So what's her name?
You know. I got a lot, more than one.
A play-ya.
You got a boyfriend?
So wadda you do with your girls?
Just chill.
That's it?
So what you think of me?
You look good.
I look good, that's it. So what else do you do for these girls?
I buy them flowers.
How you treat them?
See, I got you, you are so scared. I don't believe that you kissed no girls. That you got three girls and that you faithful and this and that.
I did.
Well, you know I'm standin' here and you say I look good?
I kissed those girls.
No you didn't, you ain't provin'it.
I aint gotta prove nothin' to no girl, 'cause I got it like dat.
Come down!
Who gives!
Wussup?
Wussup, Victor.
Eddie from Compost?
Why don't you ask Eddie?
Why?
I got punished, man.
Fa what?
I won't let my motha cut my hair.
Wha'?
She fucks it all up!
Forget it! C'mon Let's go to the pool.
They are?
Yeah! Tell me which one you would like. To be doin' nothin on a fire escape or beat the pool with a bunch of girls? Be straight up!
So what girls are over there?
Natasha, Maria, Tina-
What are you going that way for?
I'm not goin' to 10th Street, people piss and shit in that pool,
Where you goin'?
Pitt.
Oh man, what we gotta leave ar' own neighborhood for?
C'mon.
Amanda is Eddie's cousin.
Eddie from Compost?
I gotta go take a piss.
Yo, remember from the pool, that girl?
Which one?
The one with the phat ass?
I'm gonna punch you. What you want with her anyway? You in love with her?
She lives near Eddie?
I think she lives down by Pitt.
Near Natasha's? Or over by Boy's Club?
I think by Twenty-two.
For real?
Yo! What you goin' for
How does he look up close?
Umm, he got dark brownish eyes, he got a nice nose I love his nose. I love his skin. I love his lips, he got a great smile and he got-
A bad attitude.
Yeah, he got a bad attitude.
Yeah, he got boxes in his stomach. He's taller than me.
How old is he?
I think he's 18 or 17.
You gonna talk to him?
Like this?
Now salsa, you know how to dance salsa?
Yeah.
You looking for somebody?
Wha'?
You here to see somebody?
Yeah.
Who?
A girl named Amanda.
What she look like?
She's like this high, dark hair, skinny
Yo, that's my girl.
She didn't say she had no man.
You sure? She's got kind of like brown hair.
Positive.
You sure?
Positive.
My friend told me she lived around here.
Your friend must be misinformed.
So what do you want with her anyway?
I'm a good friend of hers.
How do I know you're not lying.
Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her.
Probably. One of the many.
What?
No.
You wanna do somethin' with me?
Not really.
Hey!
Where you know Amanda from?
Jus' from around the way.
You live around here?
Yeah.
I know how ta get him back if you want.
First of all, let me just reiterate that this is not a formal investigation. I'm not going through formal channels here, because if Alan Stanwyk is not involved in any improprieties, then nobody has to know I was even --
Look. You know that and I know that, but somebody's bucking for a promotion. I think it's that bozo, Hanrahan, I can't be sure. Anyway, unless I go back there with something, you and your son-in-law are next week's scapegoats.
Unbelievable.
I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah?
Utah? Jesus Christ! First of all, Alan Stanwyk does not own one share of stock.The three million dollars for the ranch in Provo comes from my daughter who converted some of her personal holdings, not company holdings. Now if anybody in DC wants to make something of that, bring 'em on. Until then, get the hell out of my face.
God I admire you.
By the way: what kind of name is Poon?
Yes sir, you are confirmed on Flight 306 to Rio tomorrow evening at 11 PM. First Class.
You're kidding.
Would you like me to change anything?
So he's going. Uh... are there any other tickets charged to the same account?
We'd have no way of knowing that, sir.
Never heard of him. Thanks anyway.
You mean her.
What?
Sally Ann Cavanaugh. Oh wait, she couldn't work in your office, she's not from around here.
Maybe tonight?
Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
That's what he said.
He doesn't know? How come he doesn't know?
I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.
Sonofabitch.
Wonder who his supplier is.
I have no idea.
I wasn't asking.
He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?
I think that's highly unlikely, Creasy.
I ought to get some sleep.
Creasy, how old are you?
Nineteen.
Hey, what are you doing?
Fletch, this is dumb.
Fletch!
Hey you're really nuts.
They didn't do anything.
What? What are you talking about?
I busted their window, they didn't do anything.
You're lucky.
You decorate this yourself or did Mrs. Chief of Police help you?
You should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. Mauve. So what's your name?
Fletch.
Full name.
Fletch F. Fletch
I see. And what do you do for a living, Mr. Fletch?
Why are you doing this Mr. Fletch?
Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probably explains the curious feeling of love I have for you.
For a gentleman who was just found holding a bag full of heroin...
It was planted on me, sir.
Your editor called me yesterday to respond to allegations you're about to print about police involvement in narcotics dealing. Fletch starts to get up, but Cummings plants his foot on Fletch's chest, forces him back down.
I'm about to break that beach wide open, and I don't need some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in the way of my men.
'Your men' might just be involved in all this.
You go back to that goddamn beach, I swear to God I'll make you regret it.
You can't keep me here.
Maybe I'm not going to keep you here. Maybe I'm gonna blow your brains out.
After I shoot you, I stick the knife in my arm, then place it in your dead hand. Self-defense. We don't do this very much anymore... but we have. Got rid of a lot of minorities that way.
My God, you're serious.
Ask anybody.
Can I call my Mom? I'd like to tell here how much I've always loved her.
I hate the beach. Wouldn't go there if you paid me. Besides, I'm way overdue on my story about off-track betting in the Himalayas. You don't think it's the mafia, do you?
Speaking of which, you're not going to print anything before my investigation is through, are you?
Not a prayer.
Thanks for coming down to see us.
Greetings, everyone.
This one's going to be even more fun.
What the hell are you doing here?
I've got it all under control, Jerry. You can go now.
Fat Sam left the beach today. So did Gummy. It began to occur to me that some things are beginning to happen that maybe I should be aware of.
I said I'll take care of it. Now, a man of your position shouldn't be a part of what's about to go down. So go home and I'll call you tomorrow.
Jerry, you're simply going to have to trust me. I've got a foolproof way to get rid of this guy and now you're jeopardizing everything.
So where do you know Alan from?
We play tennis at the club.
Really. The California Racquet Club?
Yes.
That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.
Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
That's Babar.
Two bs?
One. B-a-b-a-r.
That's two.
But not right next to each other. I thought that's what you meant.
Arnold Babar. Isn't there a children's book about an elephant named Babar?
I don't know. I don't have any.
No children?
No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.
Oh, I don't belong formally. I've gone with my aunt.
Your aunt?
Mrs. Smith.
Joan or Margaret Smith.
Right.
Well, which one?
Margaret.
Funny old bird.
Is she ever. I've got some stories....
I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.
Oh, he was dying for years.
Sure, but the end was so sudden.
He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden. You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy.
Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar.
Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
Just relax....
Did I say 'kidneys'? I meant my ear. Maybe I should see an ear dahhh -- Ever serve time?
Breathe easy...
Anyway, I'm surprised Alan got the policy so easily. I know there's a history of cancer in the family.
There is?
Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?
Just relax.
Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?
I can't discuss another patient. You know that. Well, I can't find anything wrong with you.
I'm sure it's not for a lack of looking. Maybe I should get a real complete physical. You give Alan an annual, don't you?
Yeah, we check you into Mt. Hebron for a few days, run lots of tests, charge a bundle. You can pull your pants up now.
I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?
Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.
So what do you figure?
No idea.
No idea at all?
Okay. Some idea.
Like when?
Like tonight.
For sure?
No, not for sure. When it comes, it comes. You gonna want some shit?
I think Id rather have drugs.
Fletch...
Jesus.
You don't know me.
My pleasure.
I'm serious, Sam.
What, the heat here?
Affirmative.
The two surfer boys?
Affirmative.
Thought so. What for?
For me. I'm a reporter, Sam. I'm breaking the drug story and I got the chief red-handed. Gummy gave me a deposition.
You gonna nail the chief?
I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or --
Oh, I'll help, Fletch. I'm a slave to that sonofabitch. He busted me, third offense, gave me a choice: Work for him or do fifteen long. All I get out of this is free snort.
You don't have a piece of the action?
Noooo. Free snort. That's it.
Wait five minutes, and go to my office. You'll get federal protection after that.
Gonna need it. That boy is dangerous. Fletch?
What?
You find the source?
Gum thought Brazil.
It's me doctor Rosenpenis. I just have to take another peek at Alan Stanwyk's file. What have they done with this place?
Nothing. They're still there.
Are you all right, Doctor?
Where am I?
You're in the Records Room.
I'm fine.
Can I get you something?
Have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding.
Doctor Holmes went to get you some smelling salts. He was quite surprised that you fainted.
Well, I didn't want to say anything, but I thought the dead man was my brother.
Oh my God!
Oh, God, I think I'm about to hyperventilate. Have you got a paper bag, or something.
Here you are, Doctor.
Is there anything particular you're looking for?
My associates did a biopsy on this man recently. He's supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma, some kind of noma. Hmmm. I can't seem to find any record of it.
Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here. Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign.
That's it?
That's it.
This was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.
I guess not.
Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch.
What about breaking and entering? Are you wearing anything under that?
I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.
You owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
She doesn't need the money, for crissakes. She's living with Monty. I know it.
I don't know what you're referring to. Wendy maintains her own residence.
It stinks. I thought woman were independent now.
Until she remarries, Fletch.
Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this.
I empathize with your plight, Fletch. However, you threw her out.
She was sleeping with everybody. The cable TV guy. You can't get lower than that...
You should have proved that in a court of law.
My lawyer was a bum.
I think he was sleeping with Wendy, too.
You may be right.
Are you serious?
That's history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
Damn... lost again. Sorry.
Cash. I'm impressed.
Found it in a cab. That's a grand. Apply the difference to next month.
Good evening.
I like your outfit. You got the fifty grand and the plane ticket?
Why don't you check it out for yourself, Mr. Nugent?
Because I trust you, Alan. By the way, the name's Fletcher. I.M. Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
Read this, please.
Wait a second --
He is lifting Stanwyk's two attaché cases.
Pretty hefty. Keep reading.
He doesn't read my stuff well. 'Sally Ann and Alan were married four years ago and never divorced, making Stanwyk a bigamist even in Utah. Stanwyk is also traveling with three million dollars in cash, the result of Gail Stanwyk's conversion of Boyd Aviation stock. Mrs. Stanwyk believed the money was to be used to purchase property in Utah, but it wasn't; a fact
I'd have been long gone.
Bravo, Mr. Fletcher.
And what was that?
I was already prepared to commit one murder. What makes you think I won't commit two?
I'm Harry S. Truman from Casewell Insurance Underwriters.
Harry S. Truman?
My parents were great fans of the former President.
Isn't that nice. Good man. Showed the Japs a thing or two.
Sure did. Dropped the big one on them.
Dropped two big ones. Real fighter. You're in the insurance line, Harry?
Right.
Well, I'm fully covered.
I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk. Actually, my company is the sub- insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by Alan Stanwyk, who I believe is your son.
Yes. Where you from, Harry?
California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route. Can I ask you a few questions?
Regulations, Mr. Stanwyk. And you and your wife, named....
Velma. You and Velma are the parents of Alan Stanwyk, Beverly Hills, California, executive vice president of Boyd Aviation?
Check.
Okay. Now, the last time you saw your son was when?
Ten days ago?
Isn't that nice. Since when?
Forgive me now for seeming personal, but we understand that there is a lady friend he sees here in Provo.
What the hell does this have to do with insurance?
Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy.
Has he?
Boy, what the hell's the matter with you?
Then he has.
He sighs.
And they're still married... Alan and Sally Ann.
Lets see, it was before he moved to L.A... four years April.
I'm calling the police. Then I'm leaving. You wait here for them.
Where are you going?
I really creamed the sonofabitch, didn't I?
John Ultramalensky, right?
Right.
God, I haven't seen you since the wedding.
Gee, I must have been shit-faced at your wedding, I don't --
Not mine, stupid. Yours.
I couldn't sit home and play the mournful widow anymore, and the police didn't need me, so I tried watching a Lakers game on TV, but the announcer talked to fast and I couldn't understand a lot of what was happening, so I figured if I came down here maybe you could explain the rules to me, and besides, I missed you.
Hi Sam. Hi Fletch.
Hi Gummy. Hows the eye?
Its okay. The cops did it.
I know.
They busted me last week.
They bust you every week.
I'm the Sufi.
Fletch?
Don't call me Fletch. Don't look at me. Lie back down. We'll talk.
What?
Why are they after you?
Fat Sam is turning state's evidence.
What's that?
He wrote me a nice deposition. He says he just received the drugs. You did the selling.
I didn't sell nothing! I didn't sell nothing! I just carried the drugs from the Chief to Sam.
Sure you did.
Fletch, I never sold nothing.
Where does the Chief get the drugs?
I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
Rio de Janeiro, maybe?
Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?
That's Brazil.
Yeah. Maybe.
We can't talk about it here.
Why not?
Because we can't.
Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk.
I think you've got the wrong gal, fella.
I'll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition. If you reject the proposition, you keep the thousand, and your mouth shut.
Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner?
It is nothing of a sexual nature I assure you. One thousand, just to listen. I don't see how you could turn that down Mr...
Nugent. Ted Nugent.
Alan Stanwyk.
Then I found out Hopalong Cassidy had shot himself in the game room. That just blew it for me.
Who?
I don't work for you yet, assface. Don't talk to me like that.
Here's my proposition, Mr. Nugent.
I'm all ears.
You don't look sick, Mr. Stanwyk.
I don't feel sick. Not yet. They tell me it'll start getting bad in about a month. After that... well, I'd rather not be around for it.
Why don't you try suicide?
My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not.
So why pick me?
You're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression -- beach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. I've watched you for a couple weeks.
Maybe I'm just on vacation.
Not with the scum you hang out with. I've watched. I've thought. Its a perfect scheme. I even have a perfect escape plan for you.
Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?
I'm still here.
I want it done Thursday evening, around eight PM. My wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. It's the staff's night off. These will be open.
Wouldn't they normally be locked?
Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.
I have the same problem with my help.
I will be here in the room, waiting for you. The safe will be open and there will be fifty thousand dollars in it. You will be wearing rubber gloves. Do you own rubber gloves?
I rent them. Monthly lease, with an option to buy.
A .357.
Very good. My .357. Use it and no one can trace it to you. The room will be in some disarray.
So it looks like a burglary attempt. You catch me. I get the gun, and shoot you.
Precisely. Are you a good shot?
What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first.
Get me on the first shot, if you can.
Do you have a passport?
Sure, all drifters do.
Fine. After you kill me, take the Jaguar. The keys will be in the glove compartment.
LAX. Go to the Pan Am desk. There will be a ticket waiting for you.
Where am I going?
Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.
They serve dinner on the flight?
It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent.
You've certainly thought this out, haven't you?
I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent.
You sure those doors will be open?
Yes. All you provide are the gloves, the passport, and the aim. I'll take care of everything else.
The gun, the money, the tickets, and the dying.
That's right.
You sure got the hard part.
Will you kill me?
Yo!
Can I steal you for a minute?
Only if you promise not to return me.
Deal.
'Magic' today, huh?
Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.
Shoot.
Did you hear something?
Not me.
W-Y-K no 'c.' I'll be down in a minute.
'Mr. Stanwyk, of Provo, Utah, is a former commercial pilot.'
Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin.
'Stanwyk's parents, Marvin and Velma Stanwyk, also of Provo, were unable to attend the wedding.'
Not our kind of people, you understand.
Thanks.
You doing a story on this guy?
'...Stanwyk, blahblahblah, with internist Doctor Joseph Dolen.'
I wonder if that's his doctor.
Nothing on Gail Stanwyk, nothing on Jim Swarthout. But I did ---
Did you say cops?
Yeah.
My hero.
I overheard it. He thinks you're completely out of control, he said he was gonna can you as soon as he got the story. If I were you, I'd just chuck it, Fletch. Screw him. Let him eat three full pages on Sunday.
You kidding? I got an unbelievable story here, Lar. Un-believable. Jesus. It's the cops, I know it. The Chief! And they're all over Frank.
I just thought... sure. Sally Ann Cavanaugh.
Cute young thing, too.
I'm sorry?
His bride. Cute as a button.
Of course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh?
Cute thing.
Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?
She's cute as a button.
Oh, that's all right, I've got lots more. Want to see the reception?
No, thank you.
I haven't seen you since the wedding, Jeez, you look great.
I do? Oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. I have to confess something to you. I must have been pretty plowed at your wedding. I really don't have the faintest idea who you are.
Huh? No, not my wedding. Yours.
Oh, mine! Thank God. Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's?
We used to fly together. I'm... John.
John who?
John Ultrarelamensky.
Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really.
It's Scotch-Rumanian.
That's a strange combination.
So were my parents.
Mind if I keep practicing? I need to work on my ground stroke a little.
Damn, I thought I had that one.
You should play with much larger tennis balls. So how's Alan?
What are you asking me for? He's so busy lately I hardly see him. And he's been so preoccupied.
Preoccupied with what?
Why do you keep doing this?
Stay! I must be having an off day. I'm really a fabulous player.
I have this effect on lots of women.
I bet you do.
Say, the reason I asked about Alan is that I bumped into him this morning and you know what I can't figure out?
Alan's in Utah.
I can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning.
Okay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but I'm also very married so you may as well forget -- You are trying to hit on me, aren't you?
I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.
You are a rich woman.
What's he doing in Utah?
Who is it?
It's John. John... Znhcneelsky.
Hi.
Hi.
Uh... I'm just out of the shower.
I'm sorry, I'm just surprised to see you. I didn't think... What do you want?
I ordered lunch.
You ordered it here?
Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.
I really should change.
No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today.
I mean put clothes on.
Have you gotten cuter since I last saw you?
Lunch...
All this goes on Underhill's bill?
I saved his life during the war.
You were in the war?
'I've been so many places in my life and times. I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes...'
It's amazing.
'I've acted out my life on stages, with ten thousand people watching...'
Your bone structure, shoulders, neck...
'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.'
Just like Alan. It's freaky.
Can I ask you a question?
Depends on the question.
Are you still in love with Alan?
No. I mean, 'no you can't ask me that.' I mean, ask me something else.
Why'd you let me in?
Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry.
Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?
Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.
Good point.
Oh, listen to me. I've never even been there and look what I say about it. Anyway, I know there'd be nothing for me to do. I don't even know anybody there.
What about his parents?
He never sees them and I never met them.
Thanks for the great time.
What is this?
I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk.
I think you should call me Gail, now.
Gail. I hope this won't embarrass you in any way. I think Underhill's a yutz, you won't have any trouble with him.
A four hundred dollar lunch tab!
Yeah.
I'll cover it. You have any other surprises?
Who.
So?
So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth.
What are you talking about?
He told me he was dying of cancer. Not True. That ranch you thought you were paying for in Utah? Not true.
How do you know about that?
He's a bad guy, Mrs. Stanwyk. Gail. I think he's involved in something very big and very bad.
What does all this mean?
Have you ever heard the name Jim Swarthout?
Swarthout. Yes. He's the man who sold us the ranch in --
Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush.
But I've seen the deed.
Here's this dog that tried to eat me. Here's my motel. Here's the car I rented...
Stop it. Are you saying my husband is defrauding me?
No. You can't. Look, I know you don't know me from Adam, but you've got to trust me.
Trust you? I may seem a little goofy at times, but I'm not a complete Bozo, you know.
No... I've got to go to Mr. Underhill...
I'll take you to a game.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.
Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours?
Act natural.
I was afraid you'd say that.
What's wrong, Gail?
I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today.
No.
I've never lied to him before. It's the first time he's ever lied to me. He was just as convincing as when he says 'I love you.'
I think you better sit down.
Oh God, I hate things that start like that....
What is this....
I checked. There was no divorce.
Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist???
And they're leaving the country tomorrow night.
Bastard.
I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow.
I'm calling the police. Right now.
You can't do that.
Don't tell me I can't --
I'm terrified.
Don't worry, I can take it.
You shouldn't be here.
I thought you had this all figured out. Good going 'Irwin.'
Excuse me sir. Are you a guest of the club?
Yes, I'm with the Underhills.
They just left, sir.
They'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis.
Would you care for a drink while you're waiting? I can put it on the Underhill bill.
Great. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich.
Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk?
In her cabana, sir.
Oh, that's right. She told me to meet her there. That's cabana six?
Cabana one.
One.
Would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir?
I would, actually.
Charged to the Underhills, sir?
Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion.
I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?
I recommend it.
Fine. And a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon. To cabana one.
You want I set up?
No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.
Muchas gracias.
Your call is come through.
Excuse me. I have something I'd like to discuss with you.
The door was unlocked.
Lock's busted.
No wonder.
I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place.
I commend him on his choice.
What?
I was supposed to meet Mrs. Cavanaugh.
Who are you?
Where is she?
Moved out.
I spoke to her last week. She didn't say anything.
She moved out.
So you're saying she moved out.
This morning.
What did you want under the bed?
Mattress police. There are no tags on the mattress. I'm going to have to take you downtown. Please give me your weapon.
I'm calling the cops. This is for the cops.
I'm her cousin.
Tell the cops.
Fletch.
Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?
No, I want an answer, Is the story done?
Uh, almost.
'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.
Two...
Irwin...
Oh, I hate it when he calls me that.
Irwin, professional journalism time, now. Go back to the goddamn beach and finish the goddamn story!
I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay?
No it's not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday?
I never read the paper.
What's the spread on the game tonight?
I don't know. Look!
Now, Irwin, try to follow me. You can't run the ad and then not run the story.
Just kidding, Frank. You'll have the story and you'll be damn proud of it.
You broke it? You know the source?
What's 'practically'? Is it Fat Sam? You said you had pictures of him....
I have pictures of him. Dealing...
So let's go! We run the pictures.
He's not the story! There's a source behind him.
Who?
Well, there we're in a gray area.
How gray?
I'd say charcoal.
I'm going to bite out your eyeballs, you know that?
Gummy and two cops...
Cool your tool, Frank, I need a little more time. I think I'm really on to something here.
You're onto something. That's good. What?
Just give me a hint, all right?
More cops. I think I gotta go to Utah, Frank.
Utah?
Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.
What about finding the source?
I have some ideas.
Who? Donnie and Marie?
Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt.
How could you call him?
It's called journalism, Fletch. It's called getting both sides of the story. Something you apparently don't know anything about.
It's also called getting me this close to being murdered.
Get out of here.
He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story.
You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.
You'll have it.
But not unsubstantiated charges about dope-dealing cops, and not horse shit paranoid fantasies about homicidal police chiefs.
Thanks for the vote of confidence, Frank.
I want something I can print!
I'm quitting, Frank. As of midnight tonight.
What? Who the hell are they?
This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy.
What...
I'm out, Frank. You lost faith in me.
Fletch, I got nervous. Please....
Fletch, you want an apology?
You were going to can me, right?
Not really.
Not really?
I was upset.
I'm sick of this place. I'm going to try out for the Lakers. They need a power forward.
Oh, Margie, sorry, Frieda lost the number of Alan's realtor in Provo. Can you give it to me real quick?
Jim Swarthout?
And, I'm sorry, who are you again?
Frieda's boss.
Who's Frieda?
Yes?
Apparently, someone of your acquaintance has charged the most extraordinary lunch to my bill.
You don't know the Underhills?
I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.
I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?
Mrs. Stanwyk!
But I ain't got you...
But I ain't got you...
No, I ain't got you...
No, I ain't got you...
I said, I ain't got you...
I said, I ain't got you...
Ford Fairlane, I'm Colleen Sutton and I need your help. I have a problem and it pertains to the music industry. What is it they call you? Mr. Rock and...
Don't say it. Orange juice?
Sorry about the glass. And the house. And the breath.
Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich. The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me. When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you?
Oh, that! Don't take it personally. He always wakes up before I do. Down boy! Roseanne Barr naked!
Who's your decorator?
Some fag. Charged me up the ass.
Fag? Ass? I'm sorry, is that a joke?
Poor taste. I know. Listen, I respect homosexuals. When I was young, my maid was a homosexual. My maid was a homosexual.
Now that we've broken the ice...
I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...
Zuzu Petals. You want me to rescue her from the gorgeous hell that is L.A.
No thanks. I carry my own.
Excuse me?
Five thousand should be enough to assuage any qualms you have about my family tree.
Yeah, but of course for now, I only get a twenty.
Actually, you may take it all now.
Oh... I have some questions.
Ah, the Dorothy Chandler. I was just there with my good friend Art Mooney the other night...
Who?
My God, Mr. Fairlane, you look like the Fall of Saigon.
Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g...
So you know about Johnny Crunch and myself.
Ouch... Of course I want off the case. Some monster from Woodstock tried and succeeded in killing me tonight. The fact I'm alive's a technicality.
So you...
Listen, Queen Collie, I have a code. I never, ever, drop a case. Besides, I, uh, used all your money to pay my bills, so I kinda owe you.
Nonsense. After what you've been through, it sounds like I owe you.
They did one of these about my ex- wife. It's called 'The Nutcracker.' 'The Nut-crack-er'... I don't need money. I need some questions answered.
I'll do my best.
Jonathan was such a beautiful man. No one knew him like I did... Excuse me. I can't do this now. I'll call you tomorrow.
I ask you to find a girl and instead you steal a C.D. from me. Ford. You suck.
I'll buy you a new one. I found her.
Zuzu Petals! Did she have it?
Have what?
Did she tell you anything?
Lots of things. Her favorite yogurt. The ten drummers she would take to a desert island...
Damnit... you were right last night. Jonathan and I were into more than sex. Along with Bobby Vomit, right after old Jack Grendel died, we took part in a scheme to rip off Grendel records... I didn't want you involved...
What cheap shit... hey, waiter!
We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.
That was close...
Art Mo-o-o-ney!
So many assholes, so few bullets.
Damn, Ford, you're the most cynical man in the industry and that's not easy.
I'm not cynical. Can I help it that life is a disease and everyone's a victim. So you're producing exclusively for Grendel Records now. Hope you're taking Julian for a bundle.
You gotta shave before you leave the house in a dress like that and I don't mean your legs. Why didn't you jump on her? What's happening to you?
I haven't seen her around, and as for who would want to kill Johnny Crunch, line forms to the left. You'd find less people on our planet who wanted him alive.
I've heard cars fuck with more harmony.
Julian's happy as long as he doesn't see glass shatter.
Have a copy of that sent to me, will ya?
Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure.
Thanks for the promotion, man.
Your tip paid off. Jazz, this is Sam the Sleazebag. Sam the Sleazebag, this is Jazz, my secretary.
Assistant. And don't call me Jazz.
All your friends call you Jazz.
You wish.
I do it for love.
G'day, they say it's worth three grand...
Fucking Australians! I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?
Let's just declare war on the hellhole. Before they make <u>Crocodile Dundee</u> three.
Rock stars! I'm going out of my mind. All I get are perks. I don't make money, I make gifts. How am I supposed to pay taxes with bathtub compact disc players and autographed drumsticks. I want cash. Moulah. Wampum. Dead Presidents. Andrew Jackson. Gerald Ford.
You're saying you need money.
Car insurance costs money. Cavities cost money. Doritos cost money. I'm gonna eat that damn bear... come here!
You're friends with the most obnoxious asshole on the airwaves. The King of the Shock Jocks. I'm, I'm shocked.
That's for me... Radio contests, really Ford, how tacky...
So what about this watch?
Quiet. Tell me you tapped in the police computer and found out lots of good stuff about Art Mooney...
Tonight after I see Don. Some Beverly Hillbilly just hired me to find you-know-fucking-who. Name's Colleen Sutton.
Spooky. I'll process her.
Sorry, Jazz. After this, I'll throw a burger down your throat, okay?
You're a fucking gentleman. What do you want from me?
You going to be okay?
And it's good to see you, Julian. This is my assistant, Jazz.
Why did you interrupt? Maxwell seemed like he wanted to hire me.
How'd you get this from her?
You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...
A fucking C.D. Wow, this case is closed. So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?
No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in? I mean, she is what this case is about.
I wish I knew. You did good work...
Make eye contact when you say that.
I'm sorry, that dress. What do you say we...
What did you... Hey, where's your spex?
Contacts.
I don't know, what was the case?
Ms. Sutton hired you to find the girl. Period.
She's just a bundle of energy, a real treasure...
Yeah, let's bury her.
You okay?
Lieutenant Anus has discovered the cold-blooded killer behind everything.
Ah, an obvious choice.
Hello, Ford...
I came to warn you...
I believe the last time we came across one of these, was at the ballet. What were your words... 'A fucking C.D. This case is closed.'
Aha, just what I suspected!
Hmmm, the first disc was putting out an incomprehensible stream of high bits. This one is putting out low bits. The data is in some fucked binary system. The two discs need to interface simultaneously with a third decryptor disc. Comprendo?
Your timing swallows the massive one. Grendel just tried to kill us, he's about to frame and kiss Don, and we can't do shit. Don't even ask about those discs. Goddamn that Art Mooney with a star by his name! It's tied to Johnny's C.D., I know.
What an interface!
Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
Yeah, Colleen mentioned it. What do they make?
C.D.s. The music kind. From the Grendel label.
Without Grendel knowing about it. B-I-N-G-O and Bingo was his name-O. Counterfeit C.D.s. Tape piracy has graduated to disc piracy, the sound quality's better, and so's the money.
After their initial investment in the factory, Grendel didn't need them. Told them to fuck off. They tried to get these C.D.s together in order to have proof of Grendel's involvement, so they could keep him in line. Now's the fun part...
I just can't deal with all this crap between us, I'm sorry. I'm quitting.
Let's get hitched. I guess I, you know, love you. It's a beautiful thing.
Got those Vomit invites here...
Scalping to a funeral, you're a pretty sleazy guy.
Thanks. You interested. It's festival seating, so...
How much?
Three hundred.
You gave it to the girls for one.
Hey, they blew me.
Zuzu Petals! Zuzu Petals! Yes! Who killed Bobby Vomit? Who killed Johnny Crunch? Why do people want you so goddamn bad?
A simple 'please' would suffice...
It's red, Ford.
Hello?
You okay?
Let's get serious...
Why are all these people after me?
Uh... wha? You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em. I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?
You hung out with Bobby Vomit. Who would want him dead?
I dunno. He was to sound what Cezanne was to image or at least I thought so. Ever since he died, I've been chased... <u>Omigod</u>!
What? Jesus, tell me!
Spunk, come back...
How is it you can look at that HairHead and see God, when all I see is a lucky asshole from Reseda.
Because I know rock-n-roll.
You know rock-n-roll? Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived. I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
Zuzu Petals, you're not bad. In fact, I was discussing this whole rock-n-roll thing with my pal Art Mooney the other day. You know him?
No. Who's Art Mooney?
Yeah, it's weird. Bobby and Johnny were such good friends...
Friends? You didn't tell me that.
Why are you depressed? You get in all the clubs, you never pay cover...
Stop. We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for...
Let's watch some 'M.T.V.'
People still watch that?
Zuzu, wake up...
Hah fluck, great video, huh?
Are you okay?
My axe!
I know the feeling. This must be hell. Can you believe, a flucking sorority... I'm gonna vomit Day-Glo.
This is boring, guys.
Ford, you were right!
I'm afraid so, you want her?
Nice left you got there, jerk.
This way...
Suck a dick, I left my purse...
As Clark Gable said to Ava Gardner in Mogambo: 'Fuck the purse, we're gonna die-e-e.'
Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
Pretty smooth, huh?
Smooth. I know this is dangerous and everything but it's kind of fun. Ever see "Batman," you know when Batman and Robin are climbing up the side of the building and somebody sticks their head outside the window and says... I forget what they said but it's pretty funny.
Ick.
Hey. God. You're an asshole.
I can't kill this kid's father...
Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth fairy. Kill! Kill! Kill!
Hello, Mr. Tongue! What a perv.
Are you okay?
Oh how sweet, your friend's got his own star.
You-see-it-all-starts-with-this- factory-in-Vancouver-and there's these-C.D.s...
Hoh graphic! I'm going to dream of ears for a year! Ugh!
So, Zuzu. Are you okay?
Fairlane, you gonna find out who killed the lead singer of Black Vomit?
Gut feeling.
When you going to let me work with you? Why you always fucking with me?
I got something serious to dis-cuss.
Well what is it? I'm not Kreskin.
Ouch.
Hey, you, get off my cloud. I'm talking to my friend. 1962 Fender Stratocaster with original humbucking pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left- handed motherfucking genius... Jimi Hendrix.
Who cares? I got a case.
This ain't no social call. One hundred bucks. To find my father.
Did he just say what I think he said?
Holy Colonel Mustard. Gosh, you didn't mention the big clue... Kid, I can't take your money.
You need it.
I'm sorry...
Shut up, you dummy. Who did this to you?
These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits. I think Armani. They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done.
Run to the nearest phone and call the police.
Fuck that, I mean, the heck with that. I kicked their ass! Well, I tried. There were two of them you know...
I tried to help you...!
And hey, I appreciate it...
Where's my father? Have you even looked?
Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
So, did you find my dad?
Well, I got some good news and some bad news.
Yeah, go on...
It's me.
What kind of sentimental bullshit is this?
Hey, I love you, too, you little jerk. Jesus, guy tries to make a commitment and he's gotta eat shit.
Who's my real father, man?
I need someone to help me with my case load, you interested? This whole father/son thing, if you're not into it, I mean, it's okay. You know what I'm saying?
Nice tie, Lt. Anus, sir.
You think you're so hot just because you can get into any club. You think you're so hot, just because you have sex with great- looking women. You think you're so hot just because you broke the Ensenada tape piracy ring...
You gotta admit those are all pretty great reasons...
What are you running from?
Why shucks, Lt. Anus, you told me to get the fuck out of here...
If you're hiding something... oh, oh, I'll have so much fun.
Why do you hate me? It's gotta be more than Me Private You, You Cop.
Two words. Disco Express.
Disco Ex -- man, that group sucked like a squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my publicist days...
'Booty Time.'
Yeah, and that lead singer, Jesus, that white Van McCoy wanna-be with the six-inch platform shoes. He looked...
Like me.
I was about to say he looked like shit, but hey, sure, he looked like you.
'It's booty time, it's booty time, across the U.S.A. It's booty time...'
Have a problem, call Ford Fairlane. He won't solve your case, but who cares, you'll be dead in a couple days anyway. Let's face it. After today, the California Raisins aren't gonna hire you.
That's okay. I'm quitting the music detective business to become a cop killer. Pay's the same, but it'll be much more fun.
God, I wish I could prove you killed everybody. Unfortunately, I know who the real killer is.
It's some psycho killer groupie. I got an anonymous letter that says she killed Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and now, this society dame.
Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies. The Village People rotted your brain.
Polo.
Feel my thumb? I keep it there forty seconds more and a welt develops cutting off the oxygen to your brain. I leave. Twenty- one minutes later, you're dead. The slowest, most painful minutes a person can experience.
I guess you never saw 'A Very Brady Christmas.'
Case closed, okay? Thirty seconds.
Fine!
What's fine?
I'm off it!
Off what? Twenty seconds...
The case!
Oh. One more thing. This is personal. I want you to tell me you're a big sissy.
You were saying, snapperhead? I'll bet you're not smiling now!
Oh, but I am. Dianetics, Ford. You should try it.
I want you to say that you're the biggest sissy in the whole wide world.
<u>I'm. The. Biggest. Sissy. In</u>. <u>The. Wide. World</u>.
How's it going?
You gotta be kidding! This is unfuckingbelievable! I have to start the evening crawling down Capital Records, I shoulda chose suicide then, but oh no, the night was young! Next up, my guitar! The second most important thing I own and now it's toothpicks for the homeless on Hollywood Boulevard! Then, then, after I burned up your brother, Jazz... I should say as a
The point?
Let me go out like a man.
How could Grendel Records sign such a wick-prick? I guess Julian Grendel really is deaf as a fucking doorknob. I hear Ray Charles is going to head up the video division.
Good to meet you, Mr. Fairlane. Your mouth makes quite a reflection. I'm Julian Grendel.
Boing. You're one hell of a lip reader.
I knew your father. He was quite...
Terrible thing, but good career move. His record sales have gone way up. I'll just have to create a new Black Vomit.
Well, hello, Ford.
Mmmmmmm. Mmmm, mmm.
So what did you think of the ballet? Was it like a warm Ice Capades?
Yeah, I did, you condescending fuck, but I miss Snoopy coming out at the end. Isn't your enjoyment impaired?
Jazz, we're talking here.
Uh, nice piano. Probably get a lot of complaints from the neighbors -- heh... It's another time, Julian, another place. If I told you Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and Colleen Sutton were the ones you were complaining about, the ones who tried to rip you off, what would your reaction be?
Shock.
And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
Actually you're a bit off in the motivation department... I mean, revenge is so... Bronson. Wait, where's the third C.D.? How could you come here without proof? It's a three piece set here! A computer disc from Colleen, Bobby's computer disc, and Johnny's computer disc. Together they make, oh fucking forget it!
Yeah, yeah, I know the third one unscrambles the high bits and the low bits. Shit, just start torturing me, man. I didn't even know Johnny had a disc and I can't deal with any 'Don't play games with me, Mr. Fairlane' bullshit.
It doesn't have to be like this?
<u>Okay</u>! Okay. You got me. Boy, you guys are tough. I have the third disc. Indeed. I. Do. Yes, sir. Yeah you assholes, it's in a very safe place with instructions to have it sent directly to the police if I don't make a phone call by seven o'clock. So if you'll excuse us...
It's 7:30. You really should get a watch.
I just gave up smoking. A last drink?
I'm running a little late. You see, I'm having a party at <u>THE</u> Club to introduce the new lead singer for Black Vomit. Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland.
What about Don?
Kill them. Not quickly.
When I say 'no,' run for the door.
Shit.
You'd said something about proof...
And may I suggest for dessert, the five copies I made...
Fuck me...
Maybe later, but first I want like to know why you'd steal from your own company...
When I was young, I read <u>Billboard</u> and I could not believe how much Grendel Records and how little of it my idiot father Old Jack Grendel got.
Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music. Those ingrates really take a bite. But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
Man, Julian, that accident took away more than your hearing.
I'm still the king!
You're that guy, the private eye.
You're a poet and didn't know it.
Do you really know everybody in the industry?
Only on a first name basis.
That's cute. You're funny.
That's funny, you're cute.
You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right? Do you suspect foul play and stuff?
Hi, private eye guy!
Hey, troops, here's that rock 'n' roll detective I told you about.
This isn't music!
I don't believe it. Getting paid to be the asshole you always were.
Fucking amazing, huh? Chevy Nova, you Bensonhurst shit! Still in La-la land. Look at us, two rock 'n' roll dicks. Unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.
Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard.
I don't remember any Arbor Day cards from Mr. Rock 'n' Roll Detective.
How nice.
It's my daughter, man. I know I never told you about her, but God, I love that girl. She calls herself Zuzu Petals and she's been swallowed up by the gorgeous hell that is L.A. A fucking groupie partying with the pros. You have to get my baby back, she's my pride and --
'Bye, Johnny...
So...
I don't take cases with foundations in bullshit. They are very hard to walk around in.
I am told it is difficult to pay the phone bill with gold chains and V.C.R.s. There's four thousand here.
Zuzu Petals. Sounds like a drug. A lethal one.
What's my name?
Doyle.
What?
Mr. Doyle.
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
What about you? Can you stand a toss?
I'm clean.
You don't use shit?
Did I say you could move that hand -- I'm not gonna get stuck am I?
No - no.
How's everything?
Everything is everything.
How come there's nothing out there? That stuff is all milk.
There's nothing around. Nobody's holding.
I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn.
Boca?
B.O.C.A.
Doesn't register.
Got a wife named Angie.
No, nothing. There's only some talk.
What?
Coming in this week, week after. Everybody going to get well.
Who knows?
Where do you want it?
Where are you?
Takin' care o' business, honey.
Takin' care o' business -- it's after midnight.
-- Well finish all your meetin' people and get back here now -- and bring a pizza with you.
Where'm I goinna get a pizza this time o' night?
Well try, okay?
I don't know where I'm gonna find a pizza joint open.
Sal --
Yeah?
What's your name, asshole?
I don't...
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
What?
Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
No... yeah...
Did you ever sit on the edge of the bed, take off your socks and stick your fingers between your toes?
Man, I'm clean.
Henri c'est gentil d'être venu. Je vous présente mon associé, Pierre Nicoli. Henri Devereaux.
Did you pick up the car?
It is waiting for you in the garage.
Did they follow you?
I wasn't looking.
Henri... I need one more favor from you. I know I am imposing...
My friend, I am not sure about what is going on -- but for me, I am finished.
Calm down -- Henri! You must trust me -- this is an extremely complicated situation to which there is a simple solution if you do exactly what I tell you. It's worth more money to you.
Allo... Salvatore...
Who's this --
Twelve o'clock... yes...
Everything's smooth. Beautiful. I will need a few more days though, the boys think we oughta cool it for awhile -- make sure there's no heat.
You must take me for an imbecile. Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington? I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a gendarme.
Look, I'll level with you -- I need a little more time -- I got to shift gears.
Are you having trouble raising the half million?
It has to be by the end of this week.
Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be reasonable.
It's your problem.
Tu sais j'ai réfléchi longuement à ton cadeau pour le voyage. Je l'ai choisi moi-même. Tiens.
Je peux l'ouvrir tout de suite?
Oh Alain! C'est merveilleux! Tu me gâtes. Je t'aime. Attends, je vais te montrer moi aussi ce que j'ai acheté.
Regarde mon pêcheur de baleine... Tu sais il va faire très froid cet hiver.
Avec ça tu pourras le supporter.
Mais non, c'est pour toi.
Pour moi?
Regarde, il te va parfaitement bien!
Formidable! Sans toi je m'habillerais encore en docker. Je suis passé voir Françoise.
Comment va-t-elle?
Le sommes nous?
Alain is the only man I know who can become as enthusiastic about a bridge as he can about a woman.
Are you sure it is dead?
I'm going to put them on the cat.
Sale boulot.
Il fallait le faire.
Il est en retard.
Je crois qu'on fait une erreur de le prendre avec nous.
Une erreur! C'est génial. C'est une vedette à la télévision. Il peut aller partout sans être soupçonné... En plus il a besoin de fric.
J'ai pas confiance en lui.
I'm afraid they've become a bit... over-cautious. Our American friends.
What happens to the schedule?
We must follow it.
I don't know. Boca is scared. He's not strong enough. He sees policemen in his soup.
He is not wrong.
There'll be someone else.
It's beautiful.
It was built in 1917 - and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world. The arch is still the largest in the world.
If this bridge were in Europe, it would be on every tourist's sight- seeing list.
Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it.
Look how gracefully they conceived that arch. Like a bowstring. It was built from both ends. With no support in the middle. Beautiful.
What's your story?
You're in show business.
All right, get up on that bar and dance.
What?
Get up on the bar and show me how you work. If I like it you don't have to go in.
I got no music!
I'm sorry, I don't know who you mean.
He got off on six.
There's nobody like that on six.
Perhaps he's visiting a guest.
There may be two... no, three who could fit it.
A Mr. Paul Ganapolos, he's here alone.
Where from?
Des Moines.
What's he do?
Mr. and Mrs. Alain Charnier, would be another. He's in shipping.
Yeh? Who else?
And a Mr. Michael Lowenstein, I don't know what he does.
This Charnier guy. He's in shipping?
Where's he from?
Marseilles.
That's in France.
What about you, Doyle? Who's the best fighter you ever seen?
What ya doin' out so late? Hidin' from the cops?
I hear the health department is going to close this joint for selling dirty beer. I come by to help you carry out your money.
They'll close you down if they ever get a look at those busted-valise broads you run with.
You want some eggs.
Why not?
Hey, Mutch! You want bacon?
Yeah!
Where the hell is it?
I got this little chick I'm tryin' to hit on. She's about 20, 21... I take her to Jilly's last night and she's tellin' me about how she wants to settle down one day, get married... I says, "Hey, this is 1971, baby, I'm just a dirty old man lookin' to score with some pussy."
Strike out, eh?
Yeah. In the late innings. Ya look like a night's sleep wouldn't kill ya.
A piece of ass wouldn't kill me.
When ya go back on?
Morning. Sometime.
Christ you should o' collared him right there.
Why don't you do the same, Doyle? You look like shit.
Look. My partner and I found this case and I don't want no Feds screwing it up.
Case? So far I haven't seen a damn thing.
Yeah, we got the Westbury covered like a tent.
That's crazy. You lost the Frog in the subway and you blew our cover. If they haven't moved already they're not gonna move now.
A bunch of lousy little spic car thieves.
Nothing in there except a New York street map.
Who stuck up the laundromat?
Havin' trouble? You're a dumb guinea.
How'd I know he had a knife.
Never trust a nigger.
Never trust anybody. You goin' sick?
Let's popeye around the Chez for a half hour, catch the end of the show and a couple drinks.
Come on -- one drink. Whatta you say?
Drink this.
I make at least two junk connections at that table in the corner. The guy is the stripe combo, I know him too.
Who is that guy?
Policy man in Queens.
No, you?
Hunh-uh. Check the bread. He spreads it like the Russians are in Jersey.
Whatta you say we wait and give him a tail?
Give who a tail?
The greaser with the blonde.
What for -- you wanna play Hide the Salami with his old lady?
Monica? Who's Monica?
If that's not a drop or a pickup, I'll open a charge for you at Bloomingdale's.
Make it Alexander's, I like the toy department.
Toy wit' this will ya.
I think we oughta burn him on suspicion.
Suspicion of what?
No sir -- this is where Joel lives.
What the hell am I drivin' for? I'm a first grade Detective. You're a second grade guinea.
I'm goin' check on this address in the Bronx, if you're bullshitting me, it's your ass.
Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.
We got information that there's no shit in the street -- it's like a desert full of junkies with a big score coming in to make everybody well.
Popeye.
Yeah.
It's Cloudy. Open the door.
Why not?
What happened to you?
You got the warrant?
Throw 'em in the bathroom, will you? How good are the warrants?
You want the red or the white?
The guy's a frog -- I'm pretty sure. Also he made me. Stayin' on four but went up to six -- cute.
What about Sal?
This fella Nicoli's got a record in France, Walter. He's wanted for questioning in the murder of a French cop.
My ass. The only reason you're in this is because you've got a big expense account for buying junk and you like to see your picture in the papers.
Timezit?
Same car.
Hey, Bo.
Hiya, Jesus.
Can you use a new suit for Christmans?
Where'd you get this fag shit?
This is what the tough guys are wearin'. You know I only steal from the best. It's Bonwit Teller.
Pass.
Forty dollars -- was $250.
There are four auto graveyards like this one in the other boroughs, handling about a thousand vehicles a month. Those that aren't claimed are auctioned here once a month.
No. Many are involved in crimes and confiscated... or just abandoned. This is, as you know, your prime source of scrap metal, M. Charnier.
Two railroads as part of a connecting railway which provided passage from New England to the South. It was actually the first railroad through New York City.
Why is it called Hellgate?
I'm afraid the rest of Ward's Island isn't nearly as romantic - a pollution plant, a hospital, a training school for garbage men and that area over there, where the old cars are kept, prior to being processed for shipment to, among other places, The Charnier Shipping Company, of Marseilles, France.
What is that old building?
Oh, it's been abandoned for years.
What was it?
It was a crematorium.
For garbage?
What am I, a shmuck? What's the hurry? He could see a couple of shows and visit the top of the Empire State Building.
So whatta you want a badge? It's your first major league game Sal. One thing I learned, move calmly, move cautiously. You'll never be sorry.
I been damn careful up to now.
Which is why your phone lines are tapped and the Feds are crawlin' all over you like flies.
I'm straight, Joel. They haven't got shit on me. Look, I'm tellin' you, he'll take the deal somewhere else.
That was over thirty years ago. I paid for that and then some.
You go to Xavier High School, Daryl?
Yeah.
You remember Mary Finelli?
What are you saying?
You know what I'm saying.
No, I don't.
Sexual assault, Daryl. Five years. But you got lucky, right? You got away with something else. Something you figured nobody knows about.
What I know is what I told you.
Let me tell you what I know, Daryl. You went to Saint Xavier with Mary. You lived five blocks from her. You liked her. But she ain't interested. That must've hurt, huh?
So what?
So, what'd you do about it, Daryl?
Oh, my God! What is that?! Why you showing me this shit!? JESUS! JESUS! Get those away from me!
You got a collar in here for the Nightingale murders?
Yeah.
I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North. You mind I take a shot at him?
That's Deleon and Hayes' collar.
They around?
Just missed Deleon. Hayes is up in the squad.
Where's the collar, in the cells?
No, I think he's up in interrogation.
Why haven't they killed the juice?
Switches are shorted out.
You're shitting me!
Wish I was. Oldest part of the system down there. We're on it, but it's gonna take awhile.
We gotta go underground. Get those guys out, now.
How do we get to the vault door?
Oh, man. Hope it ain't like this in Baltimore tomorrow.
Baltimore?
Oh, yeah. Damn. My watch is busted.
Hey, Rookie. Be cool. Just stay with me. This is what we do.
Frank. We gotta go back. Frank...
Stay with me, Gib. We're gonna do this.
Frank. Hey, man. You alright?
It looks open on the other side.
Don't know what's behind it.
Gotta be another way up, Frank.
You okay, man?
Hey, bud.
How about a little of the King?
Damn.
You alright?
What's the matter, Jules? Trouble workin' an eight hour shift, watching the kid and whipping up a little bolognese?
You didn't marry Donna Reed.
How was your tour?
Butch called.
Did he?
He did.
It was under control, Bud. Butchy's just getting tight in his old age.
Frankie, Johnny wants to say goodnight.
Frank...what's wrong?
Where's Johnny?
I tucked him in at Gordo's.
You give him his drops?
One in each ear. What would you do without me?
I love you, Bud.
Boy is he excited about the game tomorrow.
I'm off.
Wish you weren't.
There's something I gotta take care of. Something I need to tell you about.
Okay...
I've been talking to this...guy...this cop...on the HAM...and, uh, he...
Honey, what is it? Just tell me.
I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio.
I know. He loves that thing.
I'll be upstairs...if you want to play.
I'm serious.
Jules, I want you to say hello to somebody... I'm on with John - that guy I told you about.
The future guy?
Then you gotta hide it somewhere. Somewhere where nobody's gonna find it...for 29 years! Put it under the loose floorboard by the window!
Hey, bud.
Lucky throw, fire boy.
Okay, I'm on it. Hey.
Frank, we need to talk...
Satch, you gotta just give me...Satch is here John. You hear me? Satch is here.
What is going on here, Satch? What are those guys doing out there?
I think you know, Frank.
No, I don't.
Let's go outside and talk. We need to do that.
About what?
What do you mean?
415 Greenwich St. #302. Under the body of a murdered woman.
No. This isn't what you think.
I wanna be wrong here. But we need to go to the precinct and talk about it.
Okay, okay. I need to go say something to Julia and finish up with the guy on the radio.
I swear, Satch.
Uh, huh... Uh, huh. And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in?
As nuts as that sounds, yes.
Uh, huh.
Frank, this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl.
He's not gonna stop, Satch. He's gonna keep on...
What if I could prove it to you, Satch?
How's that?
What if I told you that in the bottom of the 6th we're gonna be down 3-0. And Cleon Jones is gonna get hit in the foot. It's gonna leave a scuff mark on the ball.
Frank, please...
The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park.
Frank, this is insane...
In the bottom of the 7th, Weis is gonna hit a solo home run. Jones and Swoboda are gonna score in the 8th. The Mets are gonna win 5-3. Go watch the game, Satch.
Deleon.
Satch, you gotta listen to me...
Frank. We know. We know it's Shepard.
You missed a hell of a game, Frank.
Next time lets put some money on it.
Looks like two weeks worth of allowance, Chief.
I know. Sorry, Dad.
Okay, start pedaling.
Daddy put the wheels back on. I'm gonna fall.
Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling.
Daddy, I'm scared.
Daddy, come up and sing the baseball.
I'm scared.
Don't be scared. This time I'm right behind you if you fall.
Daddy, Daddy, I can't.
You ready?
Wait...
Yes! That's it! You got it, you got it! Way to go, Chief!
Uh, hello?
WB2YKXB, who've I got?
Are you licensed to broadcast, buddy?
Look, I don't really remember how this thing works.
Listen, you can't broadcast without a license. Unless this is an emergency, you gotta get off the band.
Where are you transmitting from?
Queens, New York.
Whatta ya know. Bayside, born and raised.
I thought these things were for talkin' around the world.
15-band closes down at night. During the day you can chew the band with China if you want.
Sorry 'bout that. So Queens, you psyched for the Series?
I don't really follow baseball anymore.
What?
I got fed up with all the bullshit.
I'm right with you, man. He's got the heart of a lion. Hey, how 'bout the first game of the Series?
...WB2YXB calling unidentified station, Queens. CQ 15.
Hello?
I been Q-ing you all night. How the hell did you do it?
Huh?
The World Series. You called Buford's homer.
Wasn't too tough, buddy. Game happened almost thirty years ago.
What are you talking about? I'm talking about this afternoon.
Sorry 'bout that.
What'd you just say?
You call your son Little Chief?
Uh huh...
What'd you say your name was?
Frank...Frank Sullivan.
Is this some kind of joke? Gordo is that you? Are you fucking with me?
Look pal, I'm just askin' how you...
You're telling me your name is Frank Sullivan, you live in Queens and you just saw the first game of the '69 Series...live?
Right...and I'm asking how you called the game.
Gordo, if this is you, so help me...
What'd you say your station...uh, your call letters were?
Now you listen to me. My name is John Francis Sullivan, I live at 1060 41st, where I've lived my whole life. And I saw the first game of the '69 Series at my Uncle Butch's house with my father...
What?
29 years...?
What the hell...
I'm dreaming this. Shit, this is a dream.
What's going on?
Oh my god.
What?
You just burned the desk.
That's impossible.
Dad...?
How could this be happening?
I don't know.
We gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time.
Sun spot?
Yeah, that's how Hams work.
You sound...ground up...?
I'm thirty-five years old.
Thirty-five? That would make it...
1998...? This is wrong. Who are you? Why are you doing this?
It's really you, isn't it?
No, not yet.
Too busy playin' ball, huh?
You're still my Little Chief, right?
What's that?
I think I'm losing you.
No wait, don't go!
It's okay. I'm still here, Chief.
What are you talking about?
I lost you.
What?
I never knew you, Dad.
Why?
Fire.
On the job?
It was an abandoned warehouse - hit by lightening. Butch told Ma it was just one wrong turn. Said it wasn't your fault. You went with the training, with your instincts. If you'd just gone left instead of right, you would've made it.
That can't be...that's not gonna happen.
It did, Pop. It did.
When?
But that's tomorrow.
Don't go. Don't go in that warehouse...
Dad...?
Chief?! Is that you?
Yeah, it's me.
Dad, you there? You okay?
We're doing all right, Dad. We're doing good.
Tell me.
It's hard to explain. Something happened today. It was like a dream. And when I woke up I had all these new memories. Good times. Times we never had before.
Dad, I gotta tell you this...cause you should know. Cause I still remember.
What, Johnny? What is it?
Right here, Chief. Sorry I lost you last night. Damn thing keeps cutting out.
Dad...Dad... There's... I need to...
Are you alright"?
Something happened, something...
What? Johnny, what's wrong?
It's Mom.
What? What is it?
She's not here.
Whatta you mean she's not here?
She...she died. It's like it just happened.
She just died, your mother just died?
When?
October 22, 1969.
Murdered? Why?
There was this case. A serial. He murdered three women, all nurses, between '68 and '69. The papers called them the Nightingale Murders. They never caught him. But the killings just stopped.
What kinda twisted animal.
Dad, we did something. Something to make it worse.
Whatta you mean...
He didn't just kill three women anymore. He killed ten.
What are you talking about?
Something we did changed the case...changed history. Mom wasn't dead. But then after you didn't die in the fire something must have happened. And this guy, this Nightingale guy, he kept on killing...it was like a spree...seven more women.
I gotta take her away, John. I'm gonna take your mother away. He can't hurt her if I take her away.
I don't know... What about the other women?
I'll warn them.
That'll never work. They'll just think you're crazy.
What can we do? You don't even know who this guy is.
No. Nobody got... Wait a minute. I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be. I got the case file. We know what he's gonna do before he does it.
So what should I do? Call the police? You think they'll believe me?
They will if they catch him in the act. You can make that happen, Dad. You can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment.
I don't know, John. I'm a fire fighter. This is...this is different.
You ever talk to a victim's family? The one's left behind? They don't act like what you'd think. There's panic and fear. But mostly, it's like there's this logic problem. And if they could only solve it, everything would be okay. But if you look real close - look at their eyes - you can see it. Just a glimmer. But somewhere they know.
What if the radio stops working? Christ, what if I can't reach you again?
Why not just get the cops to watch the bar?
What do I tell them?
I'll be damned.
Did you see him? Do you know who he is?
No. I just kept talking to her. There was a lot of guys in that bar - could'a been any of 'em.
It's okay. This is working. This is gonna work.
Whatta we do now?
Got it.
Dad, I think I may be able to get you enough information to make sure the DA can nail this bastard.
How?
Coupla days ago they dug up a body in Washington Heights - Mary Finelli. Girl disappeared in '68. Turns out she was his first kill. Which means he probably knew her. Most serials know their first victim. I'm gonna do some checking - see if I can put any of this together...
Tell me something good, Chief. Tell me about the future.
What else, John. It must be different, huh? Are people living on the moon?
Didn't happen, we got enough problems down here.
What are we like in...1998?
We're okay...we're good, Dad.
Hey, what about the Amazin's? They pull it off?
You really wanna know?
Yeah, you betcha.
Well, game five was the big one. It turned in the bottom of the 6th. We were down 3-0. Cleon Jones gets hit on the foot - left a scuff mark on the ball. Clendenon comes up. The count goes to 2 2. High fastball. He nailed it. Weis slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie. Jones and Swoboda scored in the
Hang on a sec, John.
John, say hello to my wife...Julia.
John, you still there?
I'm right here, Dad.
You all right?
Yeah, I think so...
He killed her John. He killed her and I didn't do a thing to stop it.
It's not your fault, Dad.
Yes it is...we did this. We changed everything. I've been having bad dreams, Johnny. Dreams where I die...in the fire. I was supposed to die in that warehouse.
This is wrong...it's like we cheated...
I know... But Dad, you can't go back. You didn't die in that fire. And no matter what you do, nothing is gonna change that. So all we can do is deal with this...and try to make it right.
I don't think I can. I'm not a cop. I can't. I can't stop this guy.
But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
I need you to believe in me. To believe that we can do this.
John, he's got my driver's license.
What?
He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live.
He took your wallet?
No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
He touched your wallet! Where's your wallet?
In my pocket.
We got him! Dad you got him!
What?
His prints. You've got his prints. I'll run them through criminal index. You gotta get me that wallet.
How the hell am I gonna do that?
Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
What...
Please, Dad, just do it.
I got it.
Right, now I need you to tape it up on the outside, where he touched it, so the prints keep.
It's gonna work, Dad. We're gonna stop him.
You're telling me this maniac is a cop? What the hell am I supposed to do with that one?
What are you doing here, Satch? You off today?
Dad, what the hell is going on?
John, you there?
Yeah, Dad. What the hell is going on?
I'm here, Dad. I'm here.
Wait. Something's wrong. I don't...
What's wrong?
I'm not your uncle, kid. Gordo, what are you doing here?
Hey, Sull. My cable's out again.
Hey, OK if Gordy uses your old gear?
Sull! What the hell!
C'mon, man. Get inside. I'll come over. We'll play some Nintendo.
No. I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn't go in.
Go in where?
The warehouse. Buxton seeds. It's tomorrow.
How you feeling?
John. John, you all right?
Longbranch...?
My father didn't die in a fire?
Huh?
My father didn't die in a fire?
Fire? What are you talking about? He had cancer, John.
Cancer. It was the cigarettes. Right? The cigarettes?
Huh?
This is the Space Cowboy. I'm an intergalactic traveler from the Federation planet earth.
Gordo?
I better give you my address then.
Oh don't worry kid, I know where you live. Now I want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy Yahoo. You got that Space Cowboy. Y-a-h-o-o. It's a magic word and I never want you to forget it.
Don't choke on your pride, Sull. You ain't ever gonna catch another one like that.
She made up her mind. Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
You're not looking too good.
Maybe you outta lay off a little...
Another rough night, huh? That it?
This is getting real old, John. And I'm tired up to here with it...
I'm sorry. I just...you know...I...
She makes ten.
Ten? No. I remember this case. Three. He killed three women.
That's what we need here, Satch. A lucky break.
Our lucky break. Mario ID'd the dental. Mary Finelli...reported missing April 16, 1968.
April 16...? That means she was the first.
Which means he probably knew her.
Okay, lemme walk you through it.
I ran him through BCI...got a hit. Busted for sexual assault: March 22, 1970. Eight days after the last Nightingale murder.
So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street. Then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?
Not the first time that's been true. I'm telling you, I got a feeling about this guy. This is the guy, Satch.
Uh, huh.
What?
Got a minute?
He ain't our guy, John.
Hi, this is Julia. Please leave a message after the tone.
I thought it'd be nicer to eat here.
Sounds good.
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
I'm sure everything'll work out. She really loves you...
So how are things at the hospital?
Fine. You know Dr. Schwartz retired last month?
No kidd'n, he musta been pushing 90!
So how'd you like LION KING?
Oh, I loved it. I wish you'd gone.
I know. I'm sorry. Work.
You work too hard, John.
Hey, future boy. Frank tells me you're a cop?
My six year-old here keeps telling me he wants to be a policeman. Right after he retires from the majors. We just gave him a badge and a whistle for his birthday.
Yeah...I remember. I used to play cops and robbers but y-- ...my mom wouldn't let me have a toy gun.
You're mom sounds like she's got some smarts.
She's pretty special.
Are you a good cop, John?
I try to be.
Then I'll bet she's real proud of you, huh?
Yeah. I just wish I'd told her how proud I was of her.
Just came by to wrap up over there. Thought I'd say "hello."
Wife around?
No. No. Well, sort of. In my heart. Been dead 29 years.
You used to be on the job?
Yeah, long time ago. I know you?
I look familiar?
The 2-3. Homicide.
A hot shot, huh?
Nah, just working the job.
I hear that.
No kiddin'?
Huh.
Who are you?
Hell-
Who the fuck is this?
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
Sullivan?
You have the right to speak to an att --
Fuck you, asshole.
My name is Abel. And I am my brother's keeper.
Where are you going?
Going? How do you mean?
I mean, is there any place in particular where we can drop you off?
What is that?
I found this today. There were other pieces of the body lying there, but I believe "he" wanted me to have this...
That's an eyeball! Oh, God!
Dammit Shelly! Why do you always have to be such an asshole!
I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole. I'm an actor.
Look Shelly, you're my roommate and I like you... most of the time. But you gotta stop doing these things. Now, I set this date up for you, didn't I? So don't embarrass me. When you meet this woman, just relax and be yourself.
No more... I can't!
Who brought up this bright idea?
... One thousand twelve... one thousand thirteen... one thousand fourteen... What's the World's Record for this?
According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago.
You're all just jealous.
What're you gonna do?
So what would a weekend in the country be without sex?
Cool it, Andy.
Breakfast?
What was that?
Why don't we go take a swim?
I don't know...
We'd be all alone. We could do anything we wanted and nobody would see.
What're you doing?
We haven't looked in the barn, yet. Let's take a look.
How about a roll in the hay?
How about you and I whacking a couple of balls around?
How do we do it?
First we take off our clothes, then you get on top of me or I get on top of you...
Think you can figure it out?
That was the best yet. Was it you... me... or the hammock?
I vote for me.
What're you doin'?
I think it's called "a shower". You might try it sometime.
Hey Deb... can you hear me?
Barely.
I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one?
Do you want a beer or not?
Destroy the evidence? No, man!
I'm gonna be sicker than all of you, man. Now I gotta spend the whole weekend totally straight... I don't think I can make it, man!
I'm a slow eater.
It's dark down there.
That's the way it is, man. Cellars are dark.
Maybe we should do some exercise.
I can't find the bong anywhere. Can't you remember where you dropped it?
I can't even remember what day it is, man.
What's the matter?!
Nothin'. I was just foolin' around.
Here. Go down the cellar and check the fusebox.
Will you come with me?
Which one is it?
I appreciate the fact that you worry about me, but don't.
What are they saying?
Come on down!
What's this?
Your bed.
A hammock?
Derek... stop.
You know what I've been through. Don't ever scare me like that.
I'm sorry. I just wanted to surprise you. What can I say?
You can say... "Hello, how are you?"... for starters.
You haven't changed a bit. Always so sure of yourself. Even when we were kids, when you wanted something, nothing could stop you.
Is that so bad?
I don't know.
You're irresistible. I lose control.
Just slow down. Let me get to know you again. Let me get to know this place again.
This door was open just a minute ago, wasn't it?
What?
Look what I found. Remember these?
Did you stay here last night?
No. I got here just before you did.
Somebody was in here.
Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
Shelly! Where are you?!
Let's spread out and check all the rooms. Outside, too. You stay with me.
This is too painful to look at.
You know, I'm not sure I could live anywhere else. The nights are always so peaceful and quiet.
It's deceiving.
What do you mean?
Why did you come back here?
... To prove something to myself... to prove I'm stronger than I think I am.
And, what about us?
I'm here with you. Can't that be enough for now?
I don't know. I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us. How do I break through?
What happened that night?
You promised you'd never ask me.
When you dropped me off at the house, it was very late. My parents were waiting up for me. As soon as I got in the door, they starting yelling and cursing at me. I was so upset... I told them I slept with you. My mothers slapped me. That was the first time she'd ever hit me. I couldn't believe it. I ran
Could we move a little faster?
You know him?
Hi.
You're Shelly?
What d'ya got in there?
My whole world.
In that little thing?
What are we gonna do?
Faster! Eat faster!
Why don't you help us?
That scarecrow? Can't you tell how weird his is just by looking at him.
Come on, Shelly. Who else is gonna give him a lift?
Is... is everything all right?
Everything's gonna be fine.
Please... be cool.
Are they following us?
Yes.
See anything?
Just a dirty window. Next time, I'll know how to handle a situation like that. Let's just hope that "next time" isn't too soon.
I don't see anything.
Got any good ideas?
This is no time to celebrate!
What're you doing?
No time to explain. Just listen. When I yell "stop," you jam on the brakes as hard as you can. Okay?
Bullseye!
This has been on helluva beginning to a quiet weekend in the country.
We had a slight misunderstanding with that motorcycle gang... ... but Shelly made them see the error of their ways.
We're really sorry, but it wasn't our fault.
Vera... you and I have had a chance to really get to know one another today. I like you... very much. I was thinking that maybe.
You've just learned a valuable lesson. A beautiful girl like you should never go out in the dark alone.
Why do you do these stupid things?!
I have to.
You don't "have to."
I just want you to like me.
I do like you. But not when you act like a jerk.
Being a jerk is better than being nothing.
I never said you were "nothing".
You don't to say it. I can tell.
I thought that was the end of the song.
If this thing is burned out, friggin' Horace will ground my butt.
Who's Horace?
What?
Go out and plug the cord back in.
Will you hurry up! I gotta get this fuckmobile back before Horace finds out I took it.
That's it. Pull over. I'm drivin'.
Will you slow down? It's hard enough to read this thing.
Well, who told me to take this cow path?
You admit the sign did say "Camp Forest Green," with an arrow pointing this way.
Darren, we better turn around.
Why?
Yeah... We're gonna scare him.
That's right. Just drive toward him. He'll move. Nobody wants to die.
That's a freakin' fact. Least of all us.
Oh, jeez.
Don't worry about it. Just stay cool.
It's kinda frightening to think that a kid like that can go so far over the edge. Jason really screwed up the poor sonofabitch's mind.
He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?
I'm getting real tired of this maniac.
Maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic.
Is that all you found?
Better get out the Hefty Bags... Looks like our boy desperately wants us to believe his story.
He sure chose the right day to pull this shit.
Whaddya mean?
You just sit tight, Jason. Once the authorities from Carpenter get here, you'll...
....with a woman's touch.
Now wait a second! I thought Burt shot you.
Come on, you guys! The game's over!!
You don't know for sure. What about Roy? Nobody's seen him.
Of course not. If he hasn't already accidentally pelleted himself, I'm sure he's lost.
Ahh, nothing.
Once we nail Roy, that's it. Victory is ours.
This is taking forever. I'm starving.
That's your problem, Larry. That's why your sales are always below quota. Your instinct to eat is stronger than your instinct to win.
My ass.
You become a whole other person when you're out here, Stan. And I don't like it.
Never should've let her play.
Come on, Dad. You could have Rick drive down Cunningham Road and look for them.
Jason who?
But, Dad, we...
When are you going to stop treating me like one!
When you stop acting like one... Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. And you...
How do you know? Did you take his temperature?
What it is?
Not what...who. Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned.
I thought Jason was only a legend?
...And I said, shut up!
Can't you at least call the camp and make sure everything's all right?
Rick. Keep and eye on our wacko kid. I'll be back as soon as I can.
Daddy, what is going on?
No. No, it's not...
Yeah, hi. Listen, I've got to talk to your dad. About Jason. I've got a plan. I need to buy some things first but mainly need help to...
Tommy, my father is out looking for you right now. Something happened tonight and he's sure you're responsible. If he finds you, he'll...
What?
Didn't you say you needed some supplies to do this?
Uh...yes. But...
You got it. Just keep an eye out for roadblocks.
It's all over.
So what are ya drawin'?
There...Ya happy?
No.
Why?
Okay, give it back.
Sorry, Megan. Not this time.
Wait a minute. I just...
Are you sure this is gonna work? I mean, why didn't we bring that gun and just blast him away?
It probably wouldn't have any effect on him. The only sure way to stop Jason is to return him to his original resting place, where he drowned in 1957.
Lake Forest Green?
They did show up. Isn't that great?
Whew...Okay, hand me those padlocks.
Did you hear me?!
So what happened?
You mean you had a bad dream.
Okay, listen...what's your name, sweetie?
Nancy.
...Good. So no more bad dreams can come around here, huh?
Where'd you get this?
You know what? Sissy and Cort are playing jokes. You know, trying to scare each other.
Why?
Well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared.
Are they grown-ups?
That's debatable.
I can't believe no one called back. I better...
But what if they try and scare us?
I'm sure Cort and Sissy are back in their cabins. So you just go back to sleep and don't worry.
But what I get scared again?
It's just that Darren and Lizbeth are in charge of organizing and setting up the new campgrounds.
So where's Cort gone off to?
Are you ready? He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
Which is?
Boy scouting.
Okay, okay. I suggest that the crime was committed in the bedroom, by Colonel Mustard, with the knife.
Huh? Oh, come on, Sis. I'm tellin' ya, we can't play Clue with just two people.
Why not? I used to play it alone. I love murder games. Have you ever played The Consulting Detective?
No...Did Megan say when she's coming back from her...visit?
Hi. Everything's all right now. We're here.
I just realized something. Where's Cort? I haven't seen him for hours.
I don't know. He called somebody, then took off.
He didn't say anything?
What's goin' on?
Now you better cool out a minute, boy. You already almost got your head blown to pieces.
Will you listen, dammit!
Jason is alive. We dug up his body. I was gonna cremate it and...
Hold it. Whoa... What's your name, son?
Aren't you the kid whose mother and friends were....
Yeah. Jason murdered them and...
And you've been at some psychiatric clinic ever since, haven't you?
No problem, Rick. Come over and meet a former resident here, Tommy Jarvis. He's got some kinda prank going about...
Why didn't you cremate him?!
If you'd just go to the cemetery, you'll see I'm not lying.
Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.
You're gonna be sorry you didn't listen to me.
I sympathize with you kids. The best I can do is call the station in Carpenter and have them keep a lookout for them.
Yes!
I was going to call the clinic and have them collect your ass. But I don't want you around here any longer poisoning my daughter, or anyone else, with your warped mind.
I gotta show you Jason's grave.
I've seen it.
Don't concern yourself, Martin. This boy needs treatment. We're taking care of it. Sorry for the disturbance.
With extreme car, for God's sake. If that kid is with her, there's every good chance he'll do something crazy.
You got me where you want me. There's no reason not...
Doesn't that tell you something?!
Mr. Duke, how can you claim that Jason Voorhees is not truly dead?
How many times has Jason been reported killed before, Mr. Campbell?
Eight times.
Eight times. They've burned him, dipped him in nuclear waste --
-- But this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.
Well, let's hope not!
In the media, you've frequently been described as "salty" --
-- look, just shut up. Let's cut through the shit. You asked me here because you want me to catch and kill Jason Voorhees for ya'. I'll do it, but it won't be easy...and it won't be cheap. One hundred grand, non- negotiable.
I understand. However, our audience should be aware that you only charged forty thousand dollars to catch the Idaho skin stretcher.
Mr. Duke tonight I'm prepared to offer you your sum of one hundred thousand dollars, payable only after you provide American Casefile with incontrovertible proof of --
Diana -- you heard from Jessica lately?
...but there just may not be enough time. If you still care about her, if you still want to try to make things better between you two...we should talk.
So let's talk.
You have to...save...Jessica... Save Jessica and save the...
The what?
Steven...
I'm here.
Anything else?
I know who you are.
I need to talk to you.
I'm kind of busy right now...
I'm going to kill Jason Voorhees -- and I need you to help me.
Jason Voorhees is dead.
You know he's not...and he's coming for you.
No, I --
Twenty.
Look --
Thirty. Name your price. Everyone has a price, what's yours?
Look, I don't want your money!
What do you want?
You know what I want. You know why I need you.
You need to leave.
I know everything about you, Diana.
Everything going okay?
It's going.
Legs giving you trouble?
Steven buggin' you?
Ed...
Okay. So how is Jessica? You talked to her lately?
I gotta get back to work.
What's the problem here?
Hello...
Jesus!
Sorry, Di. I was just going to my car. I didn't mean to frighten you...
Listen...don't you worry about Ed. He'll come around. He's too good a Sheriff to let you give him the slip.
I'm just too old for going steady, Josh.
Everything'll work out. Trust me on that.
Okay.
Good night, beautiful.
Maybe you should be moving on.
Maybe you should mind your own business.
Get up!
You're talking about my lady.
She's your lady only cause she ain't had a taste of the Duke yet.
Careful, Chief. I don't think you know who I am.
I know who you are and the last thing we need around here is some freak show "bounty hunter" making trouble. I want you outta town and I want you outta town now!
That's very colorful, chief.
Where the fuck is she, Duke?!
Why did you want her body?
For a good reason.
Tell me.
Sorry.
Tell me!
Lock this asshole up.
Jessica, I'm so sorry. I...I wanted to have this cleaned up before you got here.
She's beautiful.
Her name's Stephanie.
Why didn't you tell me?
Does he know about what happened?
Jesus, Steven, that's...that's really lovely.
I mean, how can you go through life without never having made a prank call?
It was a community service.
What are you doing?
Showing Vicki what she missed out on by being such a dull kid. Now, the first thing you need in making a prank call is, of course, a phone. This one, for instance.
Steven, c'mon, we're not thirteen...
...and it's now ringing...ringing... and -- Hello? Anthony's Pizzeria? Yeah, this is officer Randy Parker over at the station.
Oh, c'mon, would you stop, please?
Is this Anthony?...Yeah, well, I just have one question for you, Anthony -- did you fuck my dog?
Oh my God, Steven.
Yeah, well somebody fucked her and if I find out it was you, I'm gonna come over there and shoot you in the head.
I'm now begging you.
Randy, you dipshit! Take these off!
Sorry, I'm working now. You see, I have a job...
Randy, c'mon!
Wanna know how I did that?
Yeah...
Well?
I'm sorry. I have to bring you to a cell.
Are you crazy?!
I'll be back later. You just be cool, okay.
Okay.
Don't do anything stupid.
What am I gonna do -- I'm locked up in a friggin' cell?!
I'm gonna get your outta this. Just hang tight. Okay?
Oh, my dear God...
How many times do you want to hear this?
Until I hear the truth.
I've told you the truth.
The truth? That Josh, a man I've trusted with my own life on more than one occasion -- let me see if I've got the order right here -- tried to rape Diana...got the back of his head blown off...took a poker through the gut...fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night.
I know what it sounds like.
You don't know shit!
I didn't kill her!
Then why were you at her house?! She didn't want anything to do with you.
She asked me to come over. She said she had something to tell me.
About what?
About Jessica.
That's a lie. Diana would never talk to you about Jessica. Not after what you did to her.
Look, I know I treated her bad --
You call what you did bad?! You knocked her up and then left her!
No -- she left me! After her miscarriage, I --
-- Miscarriage?! Who the fuck told you Jessica had a miscarriage?!
My God...you are one sorry son-of-a- bitch.
She did have a miscarriage, didn't she? Didn't she?!
What do you mean you've never made a prank call?
Never.
You mean never as in really never, or never as in it was just so stupid you don't want to tell us about it?
I mean really never.
That's disgusting.
Steven!
She's a waitress at Joey B's but she needs some extra cash. Ward's the pimp.
I'm literally going to kill you!
Ten dollars! Hell, I can't do that to you -- you can have her for a pizza.
What's going on? I heard on the P.A. system that...
The Captain's been murdered. The buzz is that Jason might be on board.
Have you seen Tamara?
No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.
But she might be in trouble...
So what else is new? Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise up -- it's not hip to be her friend.
I hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties.
Really?
It's my graduation gift from Daddy. It cost over a thousand bucks but it's the best.
He bought you that?
A major prick.
What are you going to do?
He's undefeated, you know that? Julius is the only senior I'd even consider doing it with. If he wasn't black, that is.
My parents are open minded about that sort of thing.
I think it's time for some recreational activity, girl.
Sounds good. I hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool...
No thanks.
What? Don't be a lightweight...this is top dollar toot.
It's not that, it's just that... It I get caught, I'll lose my science scholarship and everything.
You're talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do you really think I'm going to risk getting caught?
I guess not.
A real space cadet. I wonder if she'll narc on us...
I have her in Creative Writing and she's fairly nice.
What are you going to do?
That was truly excellent.
Yeah.
Time to check out the waiters.
I think I'll pass. See you later, okay?
Well...how do you feel?
What's wrong?
What murders?
Never mind, you don't want to know about it.
Tell me.
Right.
I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?
Right.
Did you hear that?
All right, all right -- I'm a major ass.
And you'll never do it again.
And I'll never do it again. Forgive me?
Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. McCulloch?
But I thought...
Where's the radio?
Christ...where's Rennie??
She's...she's dropping the anchors. I thought the Coast Guard could find us easier if...
What's that?
She never should've set foot on this ship. This is your fault!
This is Jason's fault!
Dear Christ...
Jason's here in New York.
All right. But if it mysteriously disappears en route, I'll have you sent back home the minute we dock. Understood?
What are you doing in here?
I'11 be coming around your stateroom in exactly fifteen minutes, Miss Mason. You'd better have your biology project ready or I'm phoning your parents.
They're out of town.
Where did you get that alcohol?
That's it. You're not setting foot off this ship until we return home.
Hello, Charles. Has everyone checked in?
Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. I'm a little concerned.
Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.
You have no right...
And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do.
She doesn't know what she wants. She's never had a stable life.
And she sure doesn't have one now, either. She needs to live.
I'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else, and I alone know what's best for her. End of discussion.
She's fine, Charles. Take it easy...
I thought I told you to stay away from her.
I demand to know what is going on...
What are you doing??
That lunatic has been spouting off about Jason since we boarded... It's no coincidence.
But that doesn't prove that he's the one!
Did you find Rennie?
He's doing the best he can, Charles.
I doubt very much that one even exists.
What are you talking about?
What did you do with Rennie??
There must be a phone around here somewhere.
Everyone split up -- we'll cover more ground that way.
I don't think that's such a safe idea
What a beautiful day.
You've been coming out here every summer for the last three years, young lady, and you still haven't learned how.
He never learned how either and he's still at the bottom of this lake.
He is not.
Oh, he is indeed. And ready to pull down anybody who falls in and can't swim.
You're telling a lie.
I...I can't...
You're making a big mistake, Rennie. It's not too late to put you back on land.
I'm staying.
If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of...
She didn't push me into coming.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Facing your fear doesn't always conquer it.
You had me worried to death!
But Sean said...
Can't we at least talk about it?
I refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship.
Whatever you've been...imagining... has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees. I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's all I care about.
I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.
Get in the boat, Rennie!
I...I can't...
You pushed me...
I'm glad you decided to come after all.
Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles will be.
You let me worry about him, okay? Personal experiences are what fuel the minds of great writers, Rennie. You made the right decision.
Everything okay?
Did you know that I'm giving up teaching?
Really?
Since the school is closing anyway, I'm going to write that novel I've been threatening on everybody.
Stephen King supposedly used it when he was in high school.
I don't know what to say...
Rennie -- I was just on my way over to your room
Have you seen my dog anywhere?
So, are you having fun yet?
Yeah...a lot.
I seem to detect a hint of ingenuousness in your tone. In other words, level with me.
I can't swim.
I had a skiing accident in high school, broke my left leg. It took three winters before I would even look at the snow again...but the solution kept eluding me. I finally took lessons. I've never broken a bone since.
It's not that simple.
Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
When did this start?
About four years ago...at Crystal Lake. I spent a few summers there with Uncle Charles inbetween boarding school.
Did you have an accident in the lake?
No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out.
The Captain and Chief Engineer... they've been...they're dead.
What is your location?
I...I don't know...
Is your ship equipped with Omega satellite navigation or LORAN?
Yes...
I've got the numbers.
Rennie...
Hi, Sean.
I heard you weren't coming.
I got you a present.
But I didn't get you one...
I thought maybe we could hike to the top of the Statue when we got there, if you felt like it. It's supposed to be 22 stories tall.
It's okay...you're going to be okay.
Can he really take us home?
Not completing a voyage is against everything he stands for. But I think I can convince him to call a Coast Guard cutter for you.
What about you?
I don't know...we've gone off course or something...
I think so. But we have to lower the anchors so we don't drift any further...
Where are they?
I didn't mean for you to go!
Rennie...??
Rule one, don't panic. Rule two, assess the damage and act accordingly...
We'll be okay. I want you to wait by the lifeboats, just in case.
I'm not going near any lifeboat!
But Rennie...
Rennie...what'd they do to you??
You have to call the police...
I used to drive a taxi.
I used to be head of neurosurgery. Big hospital in USSR. This hospital, I'm not kidding.
Very big.
I opened thousands of brains.
What did you find?
Big mess every time.
I wrapped my sandwiches in tinfoil. I ate and drove. I had one of those big checkered cabs.
You are going where?
Crosstown.
We must abandon.
What do you mean, we must abandon?
We must abandon.
Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud.
I never left the garage without my Windex.
I was barrister in Kenya. I said to him, get off from here. I cannot drive with your body on my windscreen.
Under the Manhattan Bridge.
Guys ready to order?
Paisley Porter. I didn't know you were waiting tables.
Elliot?
This is a great young out-of-work actress.
Say it again.
Alla puttanesca.
Nicky. I was thinking about you. I went to the preview last night.
A lovely piece of theater. Small but important.
Shut up, Elliot.
You're an artist. I'm a craftsman.
Press a button and they give us money.
How is Lillian? I haven't seen her.
She wants a divorce.
Don't talk like that.
It's over, finished and done with.
That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?
I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.
But didn't we know it would happen?
Don't needle me, Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. We're suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do.
Very dangerous.
Asbestos lining.
We must abandon.
I'm trying to think. When did you start looking so terrible? You look awful.
I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute.
You used to love life. You don't exude this any more.
What do I exude?
Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread.
Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
Tonight. What's tonight?
Shit. They don't have any carrot soup.
You mean because What's-His-Name.
You will suffer because he is in the theater. And you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears.
It's just a review.
It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.
What's the fuss? I don't get it.
That's what I said eighteen months ago.
What happened eighteen months ago?
Before his Broadway days. He reviewed the one-act I did at the Fulton Fish Market. We did this play at four AM, outdoors in the rain. One performance. For the fish handlers.
And he was there?
Steven Schwimmer. I memorized every word of this review.
That's awful.
I recite it to myself with masochistic relish.
Do you want me to tell you what it was like, reading that review at the newstand with trucks rumbling past and street vendors facing Mecca?
What was it like?
Is it safe?
Do we care?
I think we Nought to wait.
I say we go.
You say we go?
Do not inhale.
I'm not ready.
The man has taken over my mind. He's not only out there. He's in my head and I can't get rid of him. I can't write a word without imagining his response. I'm paralyzed as an artist.
Where are you going?
Don't wait Efor me.
He carries a gun.
I used to carry a gun when I drove a cab.
Where is it?
I gave it away. I thought, I'm a writer now.
We're making too much of this.
No, we're not.
I'm not a lonely spooky writer like you. Nursing a hundred grudges. I'm a man who loves life.
In other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse? The man is out there ruining lives.
It's your best play, Nicky.
He'll hate it.
We were thinking of putting in a pool.
`The most interesting thing about Elliot Litvak is that he writes the way he looks -- fuzzy, grubby and shifty-eyed.' I'm telling you as a friend.
What?
Shoot him.
The American theater doesn't need people like that.
Shoot him, Nicky. Not that we really mean it. But where does he live?
Keep going west. Last building before the river.
How do you Eknow.
Paisley Porter.
What do you mean?
About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn't tell me who.
Had to be him.
Great game.
Unbelievable.
I think you're a little confused. Nothing personal friend.
What are you talking about?
What are we talking about?
Of course I saw it.
Did you see the winning run score?
This could be it.
This could be it.
Let's work on it.
This could Pbe it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
Does it feel comfortable?
Does what feel comfortable?
This could be it.
Last night. Alan Albright called me a handsome woman. Second time he's done that. Son of a bitch.
I hear Alan's sick.
Alan's very sick. He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution.
You know about Adele.
What about her?
She's dying.
She died.
I talked to her two days ago.
Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.
Our Peter?
Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie.
Can he get through it?
They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all.
I've got bigger problems, Joanna. Personal problems.
That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed.
About what?
Steven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan.
Look. All I want is a haircut. I'm not worried about this guy.
Ever since he started reviewing the Broadway theater, nobody in this business has been worried about anything else.
They can send their heartless brilliant boy-critic. There's a much bigger thing going on than tonight's opening.
What?
The Red Sox
You mean the World Series? I thought the Red Sox were winning.
Three games to two. But if you know their history, you realize there's a tragedy in the making. I've been carrying this franchise on my back since I was six years old.
I'm proud of this play. It's so different from anything you've done.
This is how we've managed to last.
We're able to surprise each other.
In and out of bed.
Because we're completely mismatched.
I used to tell myself. Talent is more erotic when it's wasted. Will I see you tonight?
It makes me so mad. Steven Schwimmer ready to strike. The exterminating angel.
It's all worked out. They'll lose tonight. Then they'll lose tomorrow. I see it with stunning clarity.
It's your best play, Nicky.
They'll lose because they're my team.
I never see you anymore. Where are you all day?
I go to college. I thought you knew.
Do you want to get some coffee?
I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?
Why do you need a radio?
So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?
That's completely crazy.
Is it?
Don't talk like that. How prominent? What are you implying?
She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee'
If lawyers for the mob are called controversial, why are divorce lawyers called prominent?
Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.
Because you refuse to believe she's serious. You've always refused.
Don't be so steely-eyed. It's that course you're taking in criminology.
Oh please. Not now. She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.
You're too young to be studying criminal behavior. It's making you obsessive.
She is kicking you out.
Mother won't tell me how long you've been seeing this person. She's embarrassed to tell me. So why don't you tell me?
Don't call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom?
I didn't turn her into Mother. You did.
Laurel. Tickets are all set. I double-checked.
Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
Opening night?
Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it.
Take it yourself. Take a date.
And you blame me. It's because we never talk. Let's talk.
I have a class. I'm late.
Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?
Look. I'm sorry you keep running into dishonest men. But you're only eighteen. We can still turn it around.
Except I won't have a father anymore.
What will we talk about?
Will I believe you when you tell me something?
I see the outline of your body in chalk on this very floor.
Why won't you tell me your name?
I'm willing to tell you my name.
You have to tell me what you thought of the play.
First you tell me.
What else?
Packs an emotional wallop.
What else?
If you're wondering about the firearm.
Yes.
I have this thing where I have to know a person is being honest with me before, you know, I can feel completely free to be myself.
We're strangers in the night. The last thing we want is honesty.
What do we want?
Mystery. Deception.
Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy.
What's sexy?
Knowing who a person is. Down deep.
Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking?
Am I really so deeply repugnant?
Yes. And no more evasive tactics.
It's your best play, Nicky.
See, Daddy.
I've seen it twice. I went back tonight to be sure. It's a brave and honest piece of work.
What else?
See, Daddy.
Your father said you might be here.
Two-all after six.
I've been looking for you because I want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column.
We stranded five runners in the first two innings. This will come back to haunt us.
I want to be fair-minded, Nicky.
All right. What's been going on?
I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.
How prominent?
I'll have whatever she's having.
I don't want to be responsible for his food. Just a small green salad. And a Perrier.
Opening night, Lillian.
Who the hell cares?
The whole thing is my fault. I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me.
That's always been my problem.
And you've been extremely patient.
You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.
You smoked because I smoked. We were falling in love, remember? I used to see certain movies only because you had seen them. I wanted to see what you saw.
I'd forgotten that.
I went because you went. You smoked because I smoked.
That's very lovely actually.
Laurel wants us to be honest and open. Let's be open with each other.
Be open with me. I'd like that.
There may be things you'd rather not know about.
I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.
I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
Joanne Bourne.
Alma Wetzel.
Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?
I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman.
I am really, deeply sorry.
It violates so many trusts.
It was an animal thing. No real intimacy.
I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.
We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.
I'm glad we're having this talk.
What happens if somebody comes in here right now and shoots you?
What's it like to shoot somebody?
Great game. Red Sox are winning.
Life is good.
People are dependable.
All the failures, all the fatalism.
Washed away.
It's Stanley. It's the Steamer. Fate has spoken to this man in the depths of the night.
What did it say?
A thousand things.
This could be it!
Life is true.
Who is it?
I'm at the door.
Go way. I'll call a cop.
Pop, will you let me in?
Where the hell are you?
What do you want?
It's me. Nicky.
Nicky comes on Sunday's.
Where are your glasses? Go get them.
If it's you, what are you doing here?
I'm on my way to get a haircut.
Across Ninth Avenue. Dodgie's. Where you've been getting your hair cut for fifty years. Where Uncle Billy and Uncle Marty got their hair cut. Where Jim Rorty shot a man for cheating at poker.
It's a constant shock to me, how small this place is. How did we do it? Five people in these little rooms.
We must have been heroic.
Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.
Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'
You know the answer to that.
I do know the answer to that. Why don't we watch the ball game later? We'll go to Mannion's.
They're only gonna lose.
Of course they're gonna lose. We'll watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand?
Remember 1949? Last two games of the season. Against the Yankees. The Sox lost on Saturday. Then they lost on Sunday. First I cried for twenty-four hours. Then I had fist- fights the rest of the week.
It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things.
It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.
But the son is suppose to stop crying.
You'll need these. Tonight. For the play.
Don't make me sit through one of your plays.
Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.
Since when did that matter?
Let's not start that again.
My back is killing me.
Where's your elastic brace?
I can't find it.
You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble.
I lost it. I lose everything.
`Why doesn't he come live with us?' Because everything is here.
I know, Pop.
I'm lucky they don't knock down the building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is right here.
I think the building's okay. At least for the time being.
You didn't think it was okay when you lived here. You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a marathon.
Normal boy's ambition. I like coming back. You know that.
I was in a hurry to do big things, make big mistakes. Any mistakes were okay as long as it was big. But I'm trying to see these things clearly and honestly. That's the play they're going to kill starting tonight. There's a guy out there getting ready to rip it apart. And that's us. Who we were and where we come from.
So what are you going to do about it?
What do you want me to do?
I'm looking at you trying to think. Put your face in the mirror. I know I recognize you from somewhere.
Everybody else does. Why not you?
You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.
Oh yeah?
Some little kid stole the hubcaps.
The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
How come you got the kid with you?
Matthew's my grandson.
A grandmother. God bless you.
He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.
It's the kid's lucky day.
This is one charming crook. If shooting people is charming.
Now that's a complicated subject.
That's a simple subject.
You see what you're doing, don't you?
What am I doing?
You're charming the boy.
Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury.
Go on, tell him. Tell the truth. Tell him how you feel, shooting a piece of hot metal in somebody's flesh who was once a child, who was once the same age as this boy. Somebody's flesh who was innocent once.
You're a family man, Frankie?
Wife and daughter. My father's still alive. He outlives me, starting tonight. Because the Mets just tied the score. It was only a matter of time, wasn't it?
An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do?
I don't know Toyota. What does he do?
It's a complicated subject.
Your problem is you take the easy way out. Losing is easy.
Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It's a lifetime's work.
You made him strike out. You wished it on him. You want to lose. It's too hard for you to believe in something. It's hard to have faith. It's hard Nwork to trust somebody.
"It looked extremely rocky for the Boston nine that day."
You're afraid to risk believing. Believe in them. Believe in your self. Take a risk. It will humanize you as a person.
I want to believe.
Say it and you'll believe it. Life is good. Say it.
I want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments.
Then say it.
Life is good.
I don't know.
This is something no one has been privileged to see in almost seventy years. Very few people now alive can say that they have seen what you are about to see, Matthew. The Red Sox win a World Series. This is deeply, intensely personal. All the mistakes I've made, all the envy, fear and violence that's encased in this little envelope we call a
Because God loves a winner.
All the times I died when the Red Sox lost an important game they should have won. All the awful things I said to my mother and father. To Tmy wife and daughter.
Washed away.
Because life is good.
Don't worry. It's a test.
This could be it!
Then they lost?
Why does it matter?
If they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's all over.
Why do you care?
They're my team.
They're my team, too. I grew up on Boyleston Street. Right by Fenway Park. I went to fifty or sixty games a year. All by myself. I was one of those kids with scabby elbows. I called out to the players. `Look over here. Hi, I'm Steven. My parents are divorced.'
I went to college in Boston so I could be near the Red Sox. I took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game. My wife is from Boston. Lillian Ziegler?
The Red Sox were my world. I surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one.
If you're such a devoted fan, why were you at the play tonight instead of the game? Answer carefully. This is important. You could have gone to the theater last night. There was no game last night.
I was six years old the day Pesky hesitated throwing home and Slaughter scored all the way from first. That's when I knew the Red Sox were my team. Pity and terror.
When I traveled through Asia this summer, I went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so I could call up Sports Phone in New York and get the scores. I drove through the war in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone like every hour on the hour, for updates.
And you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand?
aybe we ought to postpone the opening.
Joanna loves this play. She has sunk tons of money. She is completely Ncommitted.
I had lunch with Joanna. She said she told you about Peter. You weren't concerned, she said.
hat was this morning.
'm not worried about this kid.
Well I am. Worried sick. Everybody quotes Steven Schwimmer. He's here to announce the death of civilization. He kills a play every time he farts.
Postpone. We have every right.
Too late. All the elements are in place. Delay the opening and we lose the theater.
I've had three straight washouts, Sidney.
I hate the Mets.
How come?
Have to hurry back.
Hurry back. Hurry back to what?
Game six is history,pal.
What do you mean?
To go to the theater. Wears I don't know what. Make-up, padding.
Why?
Yessiree, Bob.
Finally, I get a waiter who doesn't know "Macbeth".
Sidney remains optimistic.
Sidney.
Sidney Fabrikant. Our producer.
I was educated by nuns.
Yes.
I have excellent long-term memory.
Yes.
I kissed Shirley Felder on the teeth.
Yes, Peter.
But my parasite is consuming all the new memories. Eating my lines.
You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.
What color?
What was your favorite color crayon, growing up?
Burnt sienna.
Mine was cobalt blue.
This is your history, isn't it? Nicky? All around us. And my parasite is consuming it.
Yes.
I kissed her while she was laughing.
Yes.
And the Father replies?
This could be it.
What's good?
You've worked with Elliot?
I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him?
There was a review.
I think I remember.
So does Elliot.
Not one of Steven's finer moments.
Oh. You know him.
A little.
And he has finer moments now and then.
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
Endearing.
Engaging.
Elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike.
A little drastic maybe?
Say it again.
What?
You know what.
Alla puttanesca.
You keep slipping away. How do you do that?
I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.
I was all noise. Played the radio loud. Battled constantly with my brother and sister. Here I am, world.
I hear good things about the new play.
So do I. Over and over.
Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.
Would you like to meet him?
He doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue.
I'm trying to prolong our afternoon. In case you haven't noticed.
The fact is, I have to get going.
Is it true?
Is what true?
He wears a disguise.
Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
But you're his friend.
Do you think he can do it?
I don't know.
He's a very sweet man.
Where are you going now?
Home.
Someone waiting for you?
No one's waiting.
There's a certain kind of wounded young man who uses his oddness to get laid. Is that our Steven?
If I'm sleeping with him, and I haven't said I am, then so what?
So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm.
But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom?
I know you both. Enough. How much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy.
Do you want to talk about doing crazy things.
Yes.
What? Come on, Paisley.
Our Steven not only disguises himself.
Yes.
He feels he has to defend himself if necessary.
You've come to me. I wanted to believe you would one day.
I haven't come to you.
In other words I never understood until today how much pain and anxiety you've been causing with your reviews. Steven, it's so unfair.
Of course it's unfair. The truth is always unfair. Why do you think I live this way? Hiding out. Stealing electricity from a lamp post. Because people who write the truth are outcasts of society. I can't live openly, in a nice clean doorman building, with my name on the mailbox. They'd come after me in packs.
Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently.
Yes. I've seen your victims. One past and one future. I thought I might convince you to reconsider.
And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me.
Stay. Teach me to be compassionate.
"A high court judge has confirmed that Mr. Gandhi would have been within his rights to prosecute for assault since neither he nor Mr. Khan resisted arrest." -- I told you about English law.
Just like proper English gentlemen. I'm proud of them.
Here, you see? Even the South African papers apologize -- "a monstrous attack."
Are you sure?
Oww!
Sora was sent to tell me I -- I must rake and cover the latrine.
Everyone takes his turn.
It is the work of untouchables.
In this place there are no untouchables -- and no work is beneath any of us!
I am your wife.
Please! You're being foolish!
God gave you ten thumbs.
"Take a fifth step, that we may serve the people."
"Take a sixth step, that we may follow our vows in life."
No -- prison is rather agreeable to me, and there is no doubt that after the war, independence will come. My only worry is what shape it will take. Jinnah has --
"...what shape it will take." Jinnah has -- what?
But do you really believe you could use non-violence against someone like Hitler?
Is my finger supposed to be wrapped around that?
No. That is what you get for distracting me.
What do you expect when you talk like that?
You really are going to Pakistan, then? You are a stubborn man.
Enough.
Just an admirer...
You'd be Gandhi -- ...I thought you'd be bigger.
I'm sorry.
I -- I mean it's all right. It doesn't matter. I'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews. I've come from India -- I've read a great deal about you.
You're a clergyman.
Yes. I've -- I've met some very remarkable people in India... and -- and when I read what you've been doing here, I -- I wanted to help. Does that surprise you?
That was lucky.
I thought you were a man of God.
That's the sort of thing you'll be seeking on this "farm"...
No violence, please.
What are you doing?
Not quite. They're only "holding me" until the Magistrate's hearing. Then it will be prison.
If I want to be one with them, I have to live like them.
I'm sure your legs are quite as handsome as mine.
They're calling you "Bapu." I thought it meant father.
...and I knew something had to give. And I was determined to be here when it did.
How does a reporter in Central America learn that Gandhi was born in Porbandar anyway?
You mean Gandhi?
Back in South Africa... long time ago.
What was he like?
Lots of hair... and a little like a college freshman -- trying to figure everything out.
What'd he say?
Tell me -- do you think about hell?
"Hell!"
Excuse me, baas, but how long have you been in South Africa?
A -- a week.
I'll take your luggage back, baas.
We only make wild speeches, or perform even wilder acts of terrorism. We've bred an army of anarchists but not one single group that can really fight the British anywhere.
Fortunately such news comes very slowly where I live.
Maybe I'm wrong... maybe we're not ready yet. In South Africa the numbers were small...
The Government's afraid, and they don't know what to do. But they're more afraid of terrorists than of you. The Viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non- violence.
What can we do?
If we obtain our freedom by murder and bloodshed I want no part of it.
It was one incident.
I don't believe it -- even the British can't be that stupid!
And Jinnah?
He's waiting. He's not prepared to accept it will mean as much as you think.
They are only clinging to old dreams and trying to split us in the old way. But the will has gone -- Independence will drop like a ripe apple. The only question is when and how.
What do you want?
Without a paper -- a journal of some kind -- you cannot unite a community. You belong to a very important profession.
Hm. And what should an "important professional" write about your response to General Smuts's new legislation?
I don't know... I'm still searching for a "response."
You will respect the law.
Well, it's quite a place, your "ashram" -- is that right?
You're an ambitious man.
It's beautiful.
And you've come all this way because you think something is going to happen?
Hm. Is it?
Do you remember much of South Africa?
A great deal.
You've done me a great service.
Is it over if they arrest you now?
Are you going to walk all the way?
It has. But you'd be surprised. They understand -- they really do. It's not the workers you have to worry about.
Good. Ba will have to teach you to spin too.
I would rather march.
Do you find me stubborn?
I'm sure I'm fit for at least five hundred miles.
It is foolish if it is just to save the life of an old man.
We hope you intend to join us in the struggle for Home Rule, Mr. Gandhi.
The honor is ours. May I introduce Mr. Kallenbach. He's an old friend and his interest is in flowers. I presumed to tell him he could wander your gardens while we talked.
You mean a general strike?
After what they did at the massacre -- it's only an eye for an eye.
I will not sit by to see the mastery of the British replaced by the mastery of the Hindus!
Who is that young man?
I must say when I first saw you as a bumbling lawyer here in Bombay I never thought I'd be greeting you as a national hero.
I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.
Oh, yes, you are. It's been two hundred years since an Indian has cocked a snoot at the British Empire and got away with it. And stop calling me Mr. Patel, you're not a junior clerk anymore.
I am beginning to know Mr. Nehru.
It must have been the only Non-violent campaign ever led by a man who wanted to kill everybody every day.
They are preparing for war. I will not support it, but I do not intend to take advantage of their danger.
We need your help!
In England, I was a poor student but I --
You mean you employ Mr. Baker as your attorney, but you can't walk down the street with him?
Well, then, it must be fought. We are children of God like everyone else.
Allah be praised. And what battalions will you call upon?
They're sparing no one, I see.
No. You were the surprise. It's been all over the prison. We thought they'd be too afraid of the English press.
I don't know who they've left out there to do the work. There can't be one mine left open. Have they touched the women?
My wife publicly defied the law. They've arrested her and four others.
The fools! Sorry...
It's split the Government.
If we hold firm, it won't be the last.
Will you have a glass of sherry?
Perhaps some tea?
I dined at the prison.
Mr. Gandhi, I've more or less decided to ask the House to repeal the Act that you have taken such "exception" to.
Hm. Of course it is not quite that simple.
I'm glad to hear you say that... very glad. You see if we repeal the Act under pressure under this kind of pressure it will create a great deal of resentment. Can you understand that?
Good. Good. I have thought of calling for a Royal Commission to "investigate" the new legislation. I think I could guarantee they would recommend the Act be repealed.
You're an extraordinary man.
Assuming we are in agreement?
Yes -- yes. It's just that... in these clothes I'd -- I'd prefer to go by taxi.
All right. Fine.
I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.
And that's the basis of this "Declaration of Independence"?
...There's been no time to keep figures, but there must be ninety -- a hundred thousand under arrest. And it still goes on.
Who's leading them?
He's addressed this letter directly to you, has he?
Yes, sir, he has. The usual -- India's salt belongs to India -- but then he says flatly that he personally is going to lead a raid tomorrow on the Dharasana Salt Works.
Ah -- we should invite Gandhi. What the devil has happened to him anyway?
Have you read his magazine?
Bapu, for me, and the rest, if that is what you want, we will accept it. But out there already there is rioting because Hindus fear you are going to give too much away.
He was right. It's insane -- anything would have been better.
In Calcutta it's like civil war. The Muslims rose and there was a bloodbath, and now the Hindus are taking revenge -- and if we can't stop it there'll be no hope for the Hindus left in Pakistan.
Could we cut all news off? I know --
You almost sound like you believe that.
Come with me now, Vincent. You've gone as far as you can go.
There are a few million miles to go yet.
It's over.
Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton, to see me fail?
It's for the best.
Well? You have all the answers. How is that possible?
You didn't beat me that day. I beat <i>myself</i>.
Who are you trying to convince?
How are you doing this, Vincent? How have you done <i>any</i> of this?
Vincent, where's the shore? We're too far out. We have to go back!
We were wondering if we should leave some things to chance.
You want to give your child the best possible start. Believe me, we have enough imperfection built-in already. Your child doesn't need any additional burdens. And keep in mind, this child is still you, simply the <i>best</i> of you. You could conceive naturally a thousand times and never get such a result.
Is there any reason you'd want a left-handed child?
Er, no...
Some believe it is associated with creativity, although there's no evidence. Also for sports like baseball it can be an advantage.
I like football.
How much extra?
I'm sorry, there's no way we can.
So you've finally seen sense and come back to your old job, Vincent.
Not yet, I'm afraid.
No? What's keeping you?
I guess I'm a slow learner.
I guess so. Well, while you're up there, maybe you could tidy the place up a bit.
And don't go getting everybody lost out there. You'll give us a bad name. You won't have me to keep an eye on you, you know.
By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
I don't understand why you were dragged out here, Sir. It's hardly worth wasting your time--a no-nothing case like this.
A man's dead, Detective.
Of course, Sir. We're checking the entry log, alibis, grudges...
Grudges?
I look around, I see a lot of dry eyes. The Director was not... ...universally loved. He was leading the cut-backs in the program. You're looking at a room full of motives.
No, <i>this</i> is your man.
With respect, Sir--it may be the only unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests--
According to this, he's a sick man. Congenital heart condition. Who knows how long the specimen has been here but there's an 80 percent chance the owner of that eyelash has already died himself from natural causes.
Even if this Vincent Luca <i>is</i> alive, is it likely he could bludgeon a man to death?
Of course that doesn't jibe with what we found. This was an angry killing.
Who knows with these "deficients"? His profile indicates a proclivity for violence.
I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--
--I've already run it. There's no record of any living relative.
What a pity.
We're in the wrong place. We're wasting time.
--There's that word again. I have a feeling This man doesn't play the odds, Detective. Not exactly a slave to probability. Is it "likely" that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come to us now like a lamb?
Is there something more we should know about this suspect, Sir? I mean besides what's on his sheet.
Since going underground, traces of this In-Valid have shown up at the scene of four serious felonies. Do you need any more than that?
With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes. Maybe he's just unlucky.
I don't like anybody <i>this</i> unlucky. Widen the sweep. The West side. Draw a five mile radius around Gattaca. Hoover some of the classier establishments. Random car stops.
We're already getting complaints about frivolous search.
The skin flake was found in Michael's Restaurant. The employees are all accounted for.
A customer? Does this Michael's cater to misfits?
Of course. He's a "de-gene-erate". He works at Gattaca. Why else would we find the eyelash near the washroom? Nobody stops to take a leak during a murder.
He was afraid of being exposed. That's why he did it.
It is hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers. You've seen their security system. They know who works there. Even if you ignore the man's expiration date, his profile suggests that he doesn't have the mathematical propensity let alone the stamina to pass their physicals.
Don't underestimate these imposters.
None of the ID photos match the enhancement.
You know their workforce. Two-thirds at least fall into the category. We'll be closing down their operation for days. At least go with a fingertip sample or urine.
That's the last.
Something's not right.
He's not here. It's a blind alley.
No, we've missed something. We Hoover again.
We don't have the manpower.
Get it. From outside, if you have to.
From what budget?
What are you waiting for?
Where do we start?
Positive saliva match. The cup was definitely used since the original sweep.
We found his spit in the dead director's eye. He's signed a confession--supplied us with the suit he wore on the night. What more do you want?
It's not <i>exactly</i> him.
How often do you test, Director?
Often.
Surely you know what you have.
We believe we have a suspect.
What a relief.
Would you care to look--in the telescope?
Thank you, no.
One look through there and you would know why I can't possibly allow you to disrupt operations any further.
You're so unconcerned that you have a killer in your midst.
Right now, <i>your</i> presence is creating more of a threat. I don't think you have any concept of what we do here--how meticulous our preparations must be. We are about to send twelve people through 140 million miles of blackness to rendezvous with an object the size of a house and the color of coal. So it's rather critical to point them in the
Twelve have a mission within the week.
At least it's nothing contagious.
Hello.
Jerome--?
Good to see you're feeling better.
Now <i>you're</i> here. Who are your "friends"?
It's about the Director.
That's where we get rid of the traces of him although we never truly succeeded.
I've been looking for him. Do you know where he is?
Don't be deceived, Irene. These are just the clothes. He has to wear them. Something I could never do.
What's wrong with him?
Okay, how tall did you <i>used</i> to be?
Six one.
You okay, Jerome?
What's wrong with it?
I think I'd better choose the menu. After all, you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning how to be <i>you</i>.
Suit yourself.
Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?
German.
I don't know exactly, Jerome.
I have to know where you come from.
If anybody asks, tell them the truth-- your family disowns you. You are a disappointment, Jerome.
What about this?
It needs work.
You had to be a right-hander.
You really need that much?
<i>More</i> than that. You'll get used to it.
God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet?
Leave? Just a few million years ago every atom in this hair--in our bodies--was a part of a star. I don't see it as leaving. I see it as going home.
It's not too late to back out.
What about you? What's in this for you, Eugene?
Who died?
The Mission Director.
You wish.
What an act of benevolence--a service to the community. So that's it. Now there's nothing between you and ignition.
He was still warm when they confirmed.
This calls for a celebration. Doesn't it?
The place is crawling with Hoovers.
That's not the point.
Hey, how much of you can be there? Even if the "J. Edgars" do find something, in a week-- you'll be slightly out of their jurisdiction. Come on, we've got to get drunk immediately.
Let's get out of here.
I gotta stop!! I gotta stop!!
At least up there your piss will be worth something. You'll all be showering in it, right?
And drinking it. It's like Evian by the time it's filtered.
11.15 to the port. A maintenance crew.
How long do you stay up there before you go?
A day or so.
Up there they wouldn't be a problem.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's okay, Eugene.
You know I wasn't drunk--I knew what I was doing when I walked in front of that car--
--What car?--Go to sleep.
It's all right.
Call German.
Any particular reason?
We can't stay here.
What are you talking about?
What makes them think that?
They found my eyelash.
Where?
In a corridor.
Come on--we're taking off.
I'm not going anywhere. Less than a week to go. Not on your life--
--You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again. We should cut our losses.
Where is your head, Jerome? You're acting like a guilty man. They won't marry the eyelash to you. They won't believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years.
They'll recognize me.
And keep your lashes on your lids where they belong. How could you be so careless?
You really had other offers?
So it's not just the Hoovers who've got you rattled.
You're the one who said not to change anything. She's my ear to the investigation.
Is that all?
I've got enough on my mind without that.
If you say so. The stripe.
Not thirsty? We've got enough virgin samples to last us the week.
I don't feel too good. I think I'm still drunk from last night.
Never stopped you before. And for God's sake stop plucking your hair. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldn't go bald.
How was your evening?
Complicated. I couldn't stop her apologizing.
You <i>are</i> a catch. No doubt she's worried that she would lower the standard of your offspring. Everybody wants to "breed up". What's wrong with her?
You know how it is with these altered births --somebody told her she's not going to live forever and she's been preparing to die ever since.
You're not thinking of telling her, are you?
Of course not. But she's have to know eventually.
Where are we going?
I'm sorry. I've got plans.
Again?
She's already got her doubts. I have to act like nothing's wrong.
Where are you taking her?
Everybody goes there.
You may as well invite her here.
Will you be okay?
Don't worry about your little pin cushion. To be honest, I'm looking forward to having the place to myself.
We'll still be able to talk when I'm away. The conversation will just keep getting longer.
How long?
By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, "How are you?" Forty-five minutes later I reply, "Not bad. How are you?"
Hello?
How would you like to be yourself for the day?
How are you, Jerome?
Not bad, Jerome.
How the hell did you get here.
I have your samples ready.
Have you forgotten? I don't need any samples where I'm going.
Why have you done this?
In case you get back before I do.
Where are you going?
Thank you.
First, we may as well decide on gender. Have you given it any thought?
You've already specified blue eyes, dark hair and fair skin. I have taken the liberty of eradicating any potentially prejudicial conditions - premature baldness, myopia, alcoholism and addictive susceptibility, propensity for violence and obesity--
Anything I've forgotten?
We want him--we were hoping he would get married and have children. We'd like grandchildren.
I understand. That's already been taken care of. Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.
Antonio, the choir...
What will happen to the others?
What do you think?
Vincent...Vincent...
German, is that you?
He has the heart of an ox. He could run through a Goddamn wall--if he could still run. Actually, he was a big college swimming star.
I hope he's not just a body.
No problem. Before he dropped out he was an honor student, the right majors--
How do I square the accident?

Yeah.
I'd have to bleach my hair.
Why are you inventing problems? You two are a couple of goddam clones. You look so right together, I want to double my fee.
You can wear lifts.
Even with lifts I'm never that tall.
My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.
Why not?
These new personality corrections I've been reading about.
You worried about the cost?
Not that.
Hugo! I've found him!
I've found him too.
No bother.
I've been asked to compile a log for the investigators--they want to know everyone's whereabouts last night.
Can that be, er, verified? Were you alone?
Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene? What about <i>you?</i> Where were you last night?
I was at home.
Were <i>you</i> alone?
Yes.
So we don't know for sure about you, either.
No.
Why don't we say we were together?
Why would we do that?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean anything.
We were just looking.
Have they found our friend?
Friend?
It was a mercy-killing after all.
They found an eyelash.
Where?
In the South Wing.
Does it have a name?
Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene.
You didn't know?
Yes...<i>yes</i>...
You're angry--
I envy you, Jerome.
You'll be next.
It's here. My heart. I'm careful--weekly check-ups. I'm on a drug maintenance program, blood thinners, diet-- I just want you to know what you'd be getting yourself into.
What exactly is wrong?
Of course I think about it every day.
So you didn't do it after all.
What <i>is</i> this place?
Why are we leaving?
What about the car?
Let's walk.
Who are they?
I can't.
Come on.
My medication. I left it back there.
What happened?
You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender. Looked right instead of left.
So you're not so smart after all. I want you to know--if it ever came to it-- I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg Bank. In fact, I'd <i>rather</i> use a donor egg-- --<i>if</i> it came to it.
But "if it came to it" then it couldn't have your-- --nose. How perfect does your child have to be?
You hypocrite. Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--<i>what</i> you are? Don't you get <i>any</i> satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?
What is it?
--when you go away.
A year is a long time.
Jerome...never shy. Pisses on command. You've got a beautiful cock. I ever told you that, Jerome?
If everything goes to plan, this could be the last time I see you for a while. One week to go. Please tell me you're the least bit excited.
I've got enough here.
What's this, Lamar?
Flight got you nervous?
There's a problem, Lamar.
Just remember, Lamar, I could have gone up and back and nobody would have been the wiser--
What are you doing?
I can't do this.
I told you, the government pays. It's all taken care of.
The doctor will give you something.
I'm not doing it.
--I've read your profile. I don't know about the father but you carry enough hereditary factors on your own. You can have other children.
Not like <i>this</i> one.
The name? For the certificate.
You gotta be kidding.
All it takes is a long arm.
Hard to judge how these things happen. The Parole Board almost never reverses their decisions.
I guess it was because I was a model prisoner.
You're back with your own people now. Got you some professionals.
I get my own help.
What about them?
Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson...
Sure, You're working on the passports... ... and visas?
They will be ready. You guys do your job.
I'll take care of my end.
Hello, McCoy.
Beynon.
Three... Rudy got ambitious.
And you got him...
What about your wife?
You hired Jackson and Rudy., not me.
They may nail me into this now, McCoy.
That's your problem.
You know, you and I may be two of a kind.
I'm in a hurry.
You still don't get the picture do you? I've always heard what a smart ass operator you are.
A simple reason, McCoy. The obvious reason. To rob a bank.
I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8.
What do you add up to here?
One. The radio's rappin' about $750^000. We only got a half a million.
A little more was taken out before. My brother's a director of that Bank, Mr. McCoy... I had a few pressing debts.
So we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.
The obvious. But we are both not interested in that right now.
No. My old lady must have made a lot of promises.
Close... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings I pulled.
Don't think too badly of her... After all, you were in jail a long time and she is a healthy young woman.
We'll try again.
Hello, Doc.
Hi.
You okay?
You want to drive?
My license expired, let's get out of here.
I'm sorry I was late... I got my hair done... the girl was slow.
Feel good?
Yeah.
Where do you want to go?
It doesn't look like that.
What do you mean? You've never been there.
What's Beynon got set up?
Where did you get those?
I've been doing my homework.
Just like old times?
Better than old times.
I hope so. I am not looking forward to another stretch.
I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
Where did you get them developed?
Assumed name... Houston.
Half a million.
That Beynon's got a long arm.
What do you want for dinner?
How does it taste?
You been okay?
Pretty good... Made a quick trip to Oregon, saw my brother and the kids. Figured it would be my last chance, unless they wanted to travel.
How's Estelle?
Fatter... some things never change.
Boring.
Nothing's been boring since you found me.
That's not all of it.
You go out much?
After four years and now the question comes up.
Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
I guess I'm kind of...
It's all right.
It's just been a while.
Wait... give me a minute.
I'll be okay.
Listen, I'm just as nervous as you are.
Really?
How was it?
I was going to fix you breakfast.
You were asleep.
Yeah, well, I think I'll stick with what I've got.
$250,000 right off the top.
Is he straight?
Thanks again. I 'm glad you waited.
I couldn't have... much longer.
Yeah... I know.
Why are you laughing?
I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that wasn't enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to believe, I'm happy just loving you.
That doesn't hurt.
But sometimes I cried a lot too.
I didn't. I just waited.
... Bank President, three tellers and one guard...
Usually on the right side as you go in.
Nail him first, be careful he doesn't panic and want to shoot somebody. Local police have one car, a rover, shouldn't be in the vicinity at the time we hit unless it's answering an emergency call... if the cop car shows up remember it doesn't have any automatic weapons. Only a shotgun braced on the dashboard. Get into a tight spot, you'll be out
For exits off Main Street.
Keep going over these. I don't want anybody getting lost.
You know how I feel?
Promise you won't laugh.
If it's funny I'm going to laugh.
I feel like the night before the first day of school.
It will be such a relief not to have to think about it any more.
Waiting's hard. You never learn how.
You know I've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes... worn out waiting.
At least you were outside.
It doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, Doc.
Bullshit.
I mean it.
I know you do. But it is different. It's different. We'll be all right tomorrow.
We are always going to be all right tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few todays.
We're going to have a lot of those, We're just going to get the money and then go all the way.
What about the bank?
Doc...
They checked in.
Call the ranch, tell Beynotr we'll leave his cut here --
Why?
There are three men dead.
So what. I've got to give him his money. That was our end of the deal.
He might be ready to chop us up.
Tell me about Beynon's ranch.
Do you trust him?
I just figure the percentages. He wouldn't try a cross until he's got the money.
Let's send his cut back -- Just keep going.
If we make a mistake., he'll burn us. You make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up.
I don't want to go there.
Why didn't you tell me?
There wasn't any way to explain it.
Yeah.
You sent me to him.
When I got out, why didn't you tell me where it was?
What the hell do you want? Mary Tyler Moore?
Who's she?
She's on TV.
If you don't start telling the truth...
What do we do?
A man helped me open it...
And switched keys.
He must have.
How long ago.
Fifteen minutes.
There better be a guy with the
Your kind of mistakes are going to land me back in Huntsville.
I wouldn't worry Doc. I can always get you out... I'll screw every prison official in Texas if I have to.
Texas is a big state.
I can handle it.
I'll bet you can.
When we had trouble before it was different.
You don't like the way things are, I don't like the way things
What do you want to do?
Maybe we should split up... I'll cut the money with you.
Do you mean that?
We'll grab a room for tonight then you go out tomorrow and buy yourself some new clothes, pick some up for me... Grab some food now, paper bag it, we eat in the room.
You've got all the answers. What about when they find the body on the train?
You've got it all figured.
No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on.
There may be a hunting party.
Why, there's nothing on the news?
What?
You're full of ifs.
Maybe. At least I got to him. Where do we go from here?
That would be the first time.
When are you going to learn?
From now on you just shut up and do as you're told.
You can't trust anything these days.
I trust... Want to see what I trust... In God we trust... The word's on every bill!!!
Only one car.
Where are you going?
How much?
Are you hungry?
Okay?
No scars?
Do what I tell you, it's not a game.
We better stick here till tonight.
We're going to make it.
I want to say something.
I don't want to hear it.
Look, what you said yesterday... I guess that was right. It isn't worth anything if we don't make it together.
I don't think we can any more... If we ever get out of here, maybe I should take off...
We got this far.
We've come a lot of miles. But we're not close to anything.
I always thought jails make people hard. Not you. You're just not tough enough to forget about Beynon. I chose you, not him.
Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. We got to go one way or another.
No more about Beynon.
Sounds good.
You want to try with me?
Things can't get much worse can they?
Okay.
You and me.
Can we make it?
We get to Mexico, we can have a life.
We've got some food coming, should be here any minute.
Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.
Ten. Laughlin's going to take us across at four A.M.
Oh, Jesus... how?
Jeep. There's a dry river bed fifteen miles east. He takes us to the Mexican side, drops us off at the airfield by breakfast... we've got a 9 o'clock flight.
I'll be ready.
Yeah.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.
What is it?
Laughlin. He's always got his family around... that wife and kid of his have to stand by his side to make sure he stays off the juice and horses.
So what?
You're crazy.
Come on, come on.
Who was it?
You okay?
Where do we go from here?
I don't know, airport I guess.
They will have our description before we can get a plane.
How long before this car's hot?
Are we going to make it?
Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.
Whatever happens... we're going all the way.
Yeah, why not? We're the good guys.
What now?
That's right.
Where's home?
Utah, the Bee-Hive state. I'm from Orem, right near Salt Lake ... Say, you wouldn't happen to be a Mormon, would you?
No, I'm not.
Me, neither. There's about twelve people in the state that aren't Mormons and I'm one of them.
That certainly makes you kind of special...
You wouldn't be taking the train to Salt Lake, would you?
No, I'm afraid not.
STANDS AND PAUSES FOR A MOMENT.
I really hope you have a nice trip.
Three years ago I dynamited some fish at the reservoir.
Oh my God.
Hope you get to where you're going.
Thanks. Hope you do too.
One thing though... how do I explain this to my wife?
Can I help you?
Sure can. I'd like an Invicta 12-gauge pump with the twenty-inch barrel.
All right. Shells?
Two boxes of double-ought buck.
Gonna knock down a wall?
You're out of touch. Cops blew him up.
Where?
Chicago.
You were with him?
Yeah. I got out.
Just in case someone gets a shot off.
I worked ten years without one, I don't need one now.
Suit yourself.
Okay. How many bank exits?
Two.
What about the vault?
Chambers - Reilly. Time lock opens 20 minutes before they start doing business...
Wire pull over?
One-inch stuff on a three-number combination.
I'm good at that.
I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way...
I'll hang on to these. We don't need them till we get to Gollie«s. Okay. Any questions?
Aren't we going a little hard?
What do you have in mind?
It's just a walk-in bank. You don't have to be Dillinger for this one.
How's Mama and the kids?
Growing -- all of them - every day. 318, you'll be the only ones on the floor.
My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.
Just sandwiches...
When she gets here, have that kid of yours help her with the suitcase.
He took the day off.
Then you do it.
Drive.
How was that?
Just fine.
Where we go in1?
Mexico. I'd like to find a quiet place to cross.
I guess you ain't gonna shoot me, are you?
Let's just get to the border.
Which way?
Juarez - Chihuahua City road.
Don't you want to go to the airport?
Listen... how much money did you make this year?
What's it to you?
Come on. How much?
'Bout five thousand.
How about if I buy your car for ten grand?
You serious?
Sure am.
And I keep my mouth shut?
That's what I want.
I don't report the car and I don't know either of you?
You got it.
You're going to have to walk back to the border.
Well, I paid a hell of a price. Now for God's sake keep your mouth shut.
Wish you hadn't said that. When Slim Canfield's lips are sealed, they're sealed.
Is it possible, Mrs. Clinton?
What kind of car do you have, Harold?
A Ford... We have a Ford.
You do what he says, Harold.
I don't think you have to worry much about Harold. He won't do anything.
That right?
You can trust him...
How long have you been married?
Two years.
Can he trust you?
Something ought to loosen him up ... how comes we're going to El Paso, Rudy?
What's the damage?
Collar bone is broken. No infection yet... the bandages should be changed twice a day.
I got a nurse in mind.
The glucose will begin working in half an hour. You'll feel better then...
The three of us are going to do some traveling. We're going to take your car to El Paso.
I've got to stop.
Hello, Jack, I don't know anything, Jack.
Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you.
You can't get away from me, Albert.
I didn't know who Doreen was. Thought she was just another bird.
Did Eric Pake pull her?
Yes.
How?
I dunno. He's got his ways. He knows Margaret.
When did you find out?
A couple of weeks back.
How?
No choice. I had a visit from somebody.
Who?
Cliff Brumby. He'd seen the film. He wanted to meet Doreen.
Do you want to be dead, Albert?
Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he's rumbled. Somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat. I thought they'd just duff him up a bit. Honest.
What did you do? Albert?
Nothing. What could I do?
Did Eric know that Frank was my brother?
Yes. I told him.
What did he say?
You knew what I'd do.
What do you want?
What happened to this car?
What's it got to do with you?
This is my brother's car.
Oh ay?
Yeah.
Well, he drove it into the river.
What about the brakes?
Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
How'd it happen, then?
He was drunk. Drunk as a lord.
You know what the bloody time is! It's two o'clock in the bloody morning!
I know.
I made a mistake.
What?
I made a mistake.
What about?
Bloody well tell me who sent you.
A new venture of mine. It's going to be a restaurant. Do you like it?
Yes.
Five grand. It belongs to you. Along with a little name I'm going to give you.
What name?
Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear. Kinnear did it.
Why?
I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day, he was dead.
Why?
That's not good enough.
Christ, what...
Do me a favour. You don't really expect me to fix Kinnear on your say-so? Just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. Stroll on.
Jack, you're wrong.
Good afternoon, Mr Brumby. Carter exits.
You shouldn't have shown the film to Frank.
Jack?
Good evening.
I'd like a word with you, Jack.
That's nice.
Confidential, like.
Train goes at four minutes past twelve. You've just got time.
That's very kind of somebody. Who do I have to thank? What happens if I miss the train?
I've been asked to make sure you don't.
Who paid you to see me off?
I can't Jack. How can I?
No, don't Jack, don't.
Who sent you, Thorpey?
Where's he living these days?
He's got a new place at Burnham.
Address?
Can I go now?
Everyhing go off all right?
Fine... I want to talk to you.
What about?
She's nothing to do with me.
What do you mean? You've been Frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off. You're closer to her than anyone.
Hold it! Hold it! Who killed Frank, Margaret?
Really.
I must go. I'm in a hurry.
I want to talk to you later.
I can't.
How were things between you and Frank?
He was all right to me.
Nothing more? Just another feller?
Nicer than most.
But he was just another feller, wasn't he?
Yes.
Though nicer than most?
Yes. I can't help the way I am.
Why'd you see him so regular?
Once a week?
I call that regular.
He was gentlemanly. I like that.
Once a week you like a gentleman?
Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not. Why all the bloody needle?
What was bugging Frank?
I don't believe you, Margaret. Frank wasn't like that. I'm the villain in the family, remember?
It is. Honestly.
You bloody whore. Frank was too careful to die like that. Who killed him?
You know Sid Fletcher?
What?
You know Sid Fletcher?
I work for him.
Do you?
I know him too.
Who?
Sid Fletcher.
Oh, do you?
Yes.
Yes. I met him last year.
Go on.
Oh yes. When he came up on business.
Really?
He came to see Mr Kinnear.
We went about together.
Really?
Yes, while he was here.
While he was here. You went about together?
He was here for four days.
Was he?
Could you do me a favour?
Yeah, I'll do you a favour.
You didn't know you had a fairy godmother, did you?
No. I didn't know that.
A fairy godmother, all of your own. Aren't you lucky?
So where are we going, Princess?
To the demon king's castle, of course.
How'd you know where I'd be?
You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited.
Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk!
Nasty.
He must have been pretty sure I'd come.
Oh, he was. He told me a magic spell that would make you come.
And what was that?
Who's setting you up in this place?
Brumby.
Is he coming here?
Aren't you scared Kinnear will find out?
What does he want that bloody great country place for?
Entertaining.
What kind of entertaining?
Does Brumby get a kick out of that crap?
That's why you waited for me.
Not entirely. No.
You sure about that?
I want to give you an Oscar.
You've been watching the film.
Tell me about the girl.
What girl?
The young girl. Who pulled her?
I don't know.
Was it Albert?
Shouldn't think so.
Is it one of Kinnear's films?
Yeah.
Who set it up? Eric?
Yeah.
Then he must have pulled her.
Expect so.
Did my brother Frank find out?
Now tell me the truth.
The girl's name was Doreen. That's all I know.
And you didn't know her last name?
No.
We weren't sure where it was taking place, like.
Nice of you to come.
It's a bloody funny thing. You know a bloke for six bloody years and all the time he's as calm as gentle Jesus... ...then he goes and does a thing like that. It's a bloody funny thing.
Let her go. She'll be OK. Sorry about that.
Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.
Have another?
Look, look. Get your suit cleaned.
No. It's all right.
Thanks for coming.
Sorry about your father.
Yeah.
Tell me, Doreen, did the police say anything?
How's school?
I left last year.
Oh, what you doing now?
Working at Woolworths.
That must be interesting.
You all right now?
Yeah.
You coming to South America?
Where you going to live, then?
At me friend's house.
Where's that?
Wilton Estate.
Good. I'm off tomorrow, so I don't suppose I'll see you again. There. Go and get your hair done.
I couldn't believe it when I heard. Carter is suddenly attentive.
What?
I mean, I was surprised when he didn't turn up for work. He was always on time.
Did you work with him, Keith?
I mean, what for?
That's what I was wondering.
Come off it. Frank was... well... straight. He had no worries I know. Hell, we worked together every day for a year. It would have showed.
Why would it?
It just would. He was always the same.
Since when did he drink whisky?
Don't know.
You work here, Keith?
Keith, if anybody comes in here and asks for me, you let me know. Right?
Right.
I'm at the Las Vegas. Behind the dance hall. Do you know a man called Albert Swift?
Yeah. He comes in here a bit.
Where would I find him?
How'd you know Albert?
What you having, Jack?
Heard of a man called Thorpe?
Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a long time.
Said he'd heard you were up in town. Wondered if I knew where you was staying. Wanted to look you up. Old time's sake.
That's nice. What'd you tell him?
Nowt.
See you later.
Where you off to?
Thorpey. They were waiting for us in the car park.
How many?
Ah, Edna, come in. Join the tea set.
Who's Brumby?
Ever been into an arcade there and put a penny in the slot machine?
Yeah.
What happened to you, then?
Did they give you a rough time?
No. You bastard. You knew they'd come back.
No, I didn't, Does Albert Swift still live over the ferry?
Get knotted.
All right. All right. I want to square things with you first.
Stuff it! My girl friend's coming from Liverpool tonight. Nice surprise, isn't it?
I won't be using the room tonight.
I see.
I'm staying with a friend.
Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
It's not like that, luv.
Are you a traveller?
Definitely.
Will this do?
Very nice. I'll pay you for tonight as well.
Don't be bloody silly. You're the first since Monday.
Ta.
What is it?
My brother, Frank.
Is he staying the night?
Funny. Can I phone London?
What the bloody hell do you think you're at?
I'm sorry.
You don't look it.
No. Really, I am.
Inside? Why should I give house- room to your sort?
And what you going to do?
Make us a nice cup of tea and I'll tell you. I might even let you watch.
I'll call the police.
Suppose you tell me what the bloody hell's going on. It's my house, you know.
Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ...
Now just a minute...
You sod.
They came back?
What'll they do to him?
They bloody hurt me.
You're lucky. They kill as well.
Thorpey nearly died laughing.
That little shit!
What about Keith?
What about Keith?
What you going to do?
Pension him off.
You're a bastard.
So shut up.
What's that gun doing in your room? Suppose I phoned the police and told them there's a bloke staying in my hotel who's planning to shoot somebody?
You wouldn't.
How'd you know I wouldn't?
'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.
What's that supposed to mean?
Are you awake?
No.
Do you want breakfast?
You must be joking. I never eat breakfast, Did you sleep well?
Did you sleep well?
Are you tired?
No. Are you tired?
Do us a favour?
What, and get myself beaten up again?
No chance of that.
Not much.
They're friends of mine.
And that'll make me feel better?
What you going to do?
You coming back?
Is he?
Jack Carter.
Eric. Eric Paice.
What you doing around here then?
Didn't you know this is my home town?
No, I didn't know that.
Thanks. So what're you doing? On your holidays?
No. I'm visiting relatives.
Oh, that's nice.
It would be. If they were still living.
Meaning what?
A bereavement. A death in the family.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Well, well. Small world, isn't it?
Very... So, who you working for these days Eric?
Oh, I'm straight. Respectable.
What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
Oh, you've been watching television.
What's it to you anyway?
I've always ad your welfare at heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm nosy.
That's not always a healthy way to be...
So you're doing all right then, Eric. You're making good.
Making a living.
They're still the same. Piss holes in the snow.
Still got a sense of humour?
Yes, I retained that, Eric. Do you know a man called Albert Swift, Eric?
Jack! I didn't like that.
You should have told me who you were working for.
Cyril didn't like it, either.
Oh, Cyril, eh? So it's all girls together, is it?
You're finished, Jack. You know that, don't you? I've bloody finished you.
You couldn't win an egg and spoon race, Eric.
Eh? Have a drink.
Yes, I can see your problem, Mr Kinnear.
Sit down, Jack, I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them, Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?
Scotch, please.
Eric told me of your bereavement.
Yep.
Do you know, I never knew he worked in one of my places!
No? Funny that. Neither did I.
If I'd known, I'd have fixed him up with something better.
Yeah.
Nasty way to go.
Not going, Jack?
I have to. Things to see to.
Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.
Gerald phoned us in the middle of the night, said he'd heard you've been making a nuisance of yourself.
We've got to take you back to London.
We know why you're all steamed up, and so do Gerald and Sid.
Put it away, Jack. You know you won't use it.
Gerald wants to see him first.
Bollock naked with his socks still on?
They do that up North.
Ask me?
Not suede boots!
Knock it off, Gerald.
Are we here to play cards or talk about the old days?
Oh... I think I'll stay as I am.
You're bluffing, you bastard!
What's that? A hundred?
That's right, Harry.
What's that?
That, Harry? That's another hundred - twenty-five pounds notes of the realm.
Three hundred altogether?
All right. Two hundred.
What's that?
Four hundred?
That's right.
You're not seeing me?
I'll see you, then.
How about that, Jack? Old Harry thought I was having him on.
Polacks and deadbeats.
...Polacks...
Deadbeats all.
...they hold on to their money...
All of 'em. They, hey: it happens to us all.
You have to cheer up, George, you aren't out yet.
I'm not?
You missed a fucking sale. Big deal. A deadbeat Polack. Big deal. How you going to sell 'em in the first place...? Your mistake, you shoun'a took the lead.
I had to.
You had to, yeah. Why?
To get on the...
To get on the board. Yeah. How you goan'a get on the board sell'n a Polack? And I'll tell you, I'll tell you what else. You listening? I'll tell you what else: don't ever try to sell an Indian.
I'd never try to sell an Indian.
You get those names come up, you ever get 'em, "Patel?"
Mmm...
You ever get 'em?
Well, I think I had one once.
You did?
You had one you'd know it. Patel. They keep coming up. I don't know. They like to talk to salesmen. They're lonely, something. They like to feel superior, I don't know. Never bought a fucking thing. You're sitting down "The Rio Rancho this, the blah blah blah," "The Mountain View--" "Oh yes. My brother told me that..." They got a grapevine. Fuckin' Indians, George.
What?
The whole fuckin' thing...The pressure's just too great. You're ab...you're absolu...they're too important. All of them. You go in the door. I..."I got to close this fucker, or I don't eat lunch," "or I don't win the Cadillac..." We fuckin' work too hard. You work too hard. We all, I remember when we were at Platt...huh? Glen Ross Farms... didn't we sell a bunch
They came in and they, you know...
They did.
They killed the goose.
They did.
And now...
We're stuck with this...
We're stuck with this fucking shit...
...this shit...
It's too...
It is.
Eh?
It's too...
You get a bad month, all of a...
You're on this...
All of, they got you on this "board..."
I, I...I...
Some contest board...
I...
It's not.
And it's not right to the customers.
I know it's not. I'll tell you, you got, you know, you got...what did I learn as a kid on Western? Don't sell a guy one car. Sell him five cars over fifteen years.
That's right?
Eh...?
That's right?
Goddamn right, that's right. Guys come on: "Oh, the blah blah blah, I know what I'll do: I'll go in and rob everyone blind and go to Argentina cause nobody ever thought of this before."
...that's right...
Eh?
No. That's absolutely right.
And so they kill the goose. I, I, I'll...and a fuckin' man, worked all his life has got to...
...that's right...
Shoes, boots, yes...
For some fuckin' "Sell ten thousand and you win the steak knives..."
For some sales pro...
...sales promotion, "You lose, then we fire your..." No. It's medieval... it's wrong. "Or we're going to fire your ass." It's wrong.
Yes.
Yes, it is. And you know who's responsible?
Who?
You know who it is. It's Mitch. And Murray. 'Cause it doesn't have to be this way.
No.
Look at Jerry Graff. He's clean, he's doing business for himself, he's got his, that list of his with the nurses...see? You see? That's thinking. Why take ten percent? A ten percent comm...why are we giving the rest away? What are we giving ninety per...for nothing. For some jerk sit in the office tell you "Get out there and close." "Go win the Cadillac."
That's thinking. Now, he's got the leads, he goes in business for himself. He's...that's what I... that's thinking! "Who? Who's got a steady job, a couple bucks nobody's touched, who?"
Nurses.
So Graff buys a fucking list of nurses, one grand--if he paid two I'll eat my hat--four, five thousand nurses, and he's going wild...
He is?
He's doing very well.
I heard that they were running cold.
The nurses?
Yes.
You hear a lot of things...He's doing very well. He's doing very well.
With River Oaks?
River Oaks, Brook Farms. All of that shit. Somebody told me, you know what he's clearing himself? Fourteen, fifteen grand a week.
That's what I'm saying. Why? The leads. He's got the good leads... what are we, we're sitting in the shit here. Why? We have to go to them to get them. Huh. Ninety percent our sale, we're paying to the office for the leads.
The leads, the overhead, the telephones, there's lots of things.
What do you need? A telephone, some broad to say "Good morning," nothing...nothing...
No, it's not that simple, Dave...
Yes. It is. It is simple, and you know what the hard part is?
What?
Starting up.
What hard part?
Of doing the thing. The dif...the difference. Between me and Jerry Graff. Going to business for yourself. The hard part is...you know what it is?
What?
Just the act.
To say "I'm going on my own." 'Cause what you do, George, let me tell you what you do: you find yourself in thrall to someone else. And we enslave ourselves. To please. To win some fucking toaster...to...to... and the guy who got there first made up those...
That's right...
He made up those rules, and we're working for him.
That's the truth...
That's the God's truth. And it gets me depressed. I swear that it does. At MY AGE. To see a goddamn: "Somebody wins the Cadillac this month. P.S. Two guys get fucked."
Huh.
You don't ax your sales force.
No.
You...
You...
You build it!
That's what I...
You fucking build it! Men come...
...you're absolutely right.
They...
They have...
When they...
Look look look look, when they build your business, then you can't fucking turn around, enslave them, treat them like children, fuck them up the ass, leave them to fend for themselves... no. No. You're absolutely right, and I want to tell you something.
What?
I want to tell you what somebody should do.
What?
Someone should stand up and strike back.
What do you mean?
Somebody...
Yes...?
Should do something to them.
Something. To pay them back. Someone, someone should hurt them. Murray and Mitch.
Someone should hurt them.
Yes.
How?
How? Do something to hurt them. Where they live.
Someone should rob the office.
Huh.
What could somebody get for them?
How many leads have we got?
The Glengarry...the premium leads...? I'd say we got five thousand. Five. Five thousand leads.
And you're saying a fella could take and sell these leads to Jerry Graff.
Yes.
How do you know he'd buy them?
Graff? Because I worked for him.
You haven't talked to him.
Yes. I mean are you actually talking about this, or are we just...
No, we're just...
We're just "talking" about it.
We're just speaking about it. As an idea.
As an idea.
Yes.
No.
Talking about it as a...
No.
As a robbery.
As a "robbery"?! No.
Well. Well...
So all this, um, you didn't, actually, you didn't go talk to Graff.
You didn't?
No. Not actually.
Did you?
What did you say?
Yes. I said, "Not actually." The fuck you care, George? We're just talking...
Because, because, you know, it's a crime.
That's right. It's a crime. It is a crime. It's also very safe.
You're actually talking about this?
You're going to steal the leads?
Did I say that?
Did you talk to Graff?
Is that what I said?
What did he say?
Yes.
What will he pay?
A buck a shot.
For five thousand?
However they are, that's the deal. A buck a throw. Five thousand dollars. Split it half and half.
You're saying "me."
A job with Graff.
Is that what I said?
He'd give me a job.
Yes. It is, George. Yes. It's a big decision. And it's a big reward. It's a big reward. For one night's work. But it's got to be tonight.
What?
What? What? The leads.
You have to steal the leads tonight?
That's right, the guys are moving them downtown. After the thirtieth. Murray and Mitch. After the contest.
You're, you're saying so you have to go in there tonight and...
You...
I'm sorry?
Me?
Yes.
I...
It's not something for nothing, George, I took you in on this, you have to go. That's your thing. I've made the deal with Graff. I can't go. I can't go in, I've spoken on this too much. I've got a big mouth. "The fucking leads" et cetera, blah blah blah "...the fucking tight ass company..."
They'll know when you go over to Graff...
Dave.
Yes.
You want me to break into the office tonight and steal the leads?
Oh, yes, George.
What does that mean?
Listen to this. I have an alibi, I'm going to the Como Inn, why? Why? The place gets robbed, they're going to come looking for me. Why? Because I probably did it. Are you going to turn me in? George? Are you going to turn me in?
What if you don't get caught?
They come to you, you going to turn me in?
Why would they come to me?
They're going to come to everyone.
Why would I do it?
You wouldn't, George, that's why I'm talking to you. Answer me. They come to you. You going to turn me in?
No.
Are you sure?
Yes. I'm sure.
...you don't have to come in...
...and rob the place...
...I thought that we were only talking...
...they take me, then. They're going to ask me who were my accomplices.
Me?
Absolutely.
That's ridiculous.
Well, to the law, you're an accessory. Before the fact.
I didn't ask to be.
Then tough luck, George, because you are.
Why? Why, because you only told me about it?
That's right.
Why are you doing this to me, Dave. Why are you talking this way to me? I don't understand. Why are you doing this at all...?
Well, well, well, talk to me, we sat down to eat dinner, and here I'm a criminal...
You went for it.
In the abstract...
So I'm making it concrete.
Why?
Why? Why you going to give me five grand?
Do you need five grand?
Is that what I just said?
You need money? Is that the...
Hey, hey, let's just keep it simple, what I need is not the...what do you need...?
What is the five grand? What is the, you said that we were going to split five...
I lied. Alright? My end is my business. Your end's twenty-five. In or out. You tell me, you're out you take the consequences.
I do?
And why is that?
Can we get some coffee...?
Fine.
Uh-huh.
I, you know, they should be insured.
Then, you know, they wouldn't be so ups...
Yeah. That's swell. Yes. You're right. How are you?
I'm fine. You mean the board? You mean the board...?
I don't...yes. Okay, the board.
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm fucked on the board. You. You see how...I... I can't...my mind must be in other places. 'Cause I can't do any...
I can't close 'em.
Well, they're old. I saw the shit that they were giving you.
Yes.
Huh?
Yes. They are old.
They're ancient.
Clear...
It is dead.
It's a waste of time.
Yes. I'm no fucking good.
That's...
Everything I...you know...
That's not...Fuck that shit, George. You're a, hey, you had a bad month. You're a good man, George.
I am?
You hit a bad streak. We've all... look at this: fifteen units Mountain View, the fucking things get stole.
He said he filed...
He filed half of them, he filed the big one. All the little ones, I have, I have to go back and...ah, fuck, I got to go out like a fucking schmuck hat in my hand and reclose the... I mean, talk about a bad streak. That would sap anyone's self confi... I got to go out and reclose all my... Where's the phones?
They stole...
What. What kind of outfit are we running where...where anyone...
They stole the phones.
Where criminals can come in here... they take the...
You think they're going to catch... where are you going?
Were the leads...
...what am I going to do all month...
He said we're all going to have to go talk to the guy.
He said we...
To the cops?
Yeah.
Yeah. That's swell. Another waste of time.
A waste of time? Why?
Why? 'Cause they aren't going to find the guy.
The cops?
Yes. The cops. No.
They aren't?
No.
Why don't you think so?
Why? Because they're stupid. "Where were you last night..."
Where were you?
Where was I?
Yes.
I was at home, where were you?
See...? Were you the guy who broke in?
Was I?
Yes.
No.
Then don't sweat it, George, you know why?
No.
You have nothing to hide.
When I talk to the police, I get nervous.
Yeah. You know who doesn't?
No, who?
Thieves.
Why?
They're inured to it.
You think so?
Will you excuse...
Where did Moss...? I...
Will you excuse us please?
Did they...?
You understand?
Did they catch...?
Did the leads come in yet?
No.
Oh, God, I hate this job.
Read it. Bruce and Harriett Nyborg. What happened here?
Shelly, the Machine, Levene.
You...
That's great.
Wh...wh...Wha...?
...how can you talk to me that... that...
Rick, I'm going to flag a cab.
Who used to say that?
I, um, and may...maybe they're in... they're in...you should, John, if we're ins...
I don't know, George, why?
What?
That they're going to be upset.
Shelly: get in the office.
...Come in here...I work here, I don't come in here to be mistreated...
Go to lunch, will you...
I want to work today, that's why I came...
The leads come in, I'll let...
...that's why I came in. I thought I...
Just go to lunch.
I don't want to go to lunch.
Go to lunch, George.
Where does he get off to talk that way to a working man? It's not...
Will you take it outside, we have people trying to do business here...
That's what, that's what, that's what I was trying to do. That's why I came in...I meet gestapo tac...
I meet gestapo tactics...I meet gestapo tactics...That's not right... No man has the right to..."Call an attorney," that means you're guilt... you're under sus..."Co...," he says, "cooperate" or we'll go downtown. That's not...as long as I've...
Mmm.
Williamson...Williamson, they stole the contracts...?
Excuse me, sir...
Excuse me, fella.
...did they...
Would you excuse us, please...?
Oh, fuck. Fuck. FUCK FUCK FUCK! WILLIAMSON!!! WILLIAMSON!!! OPEN THE FUCKING...WILLIAMSON...
Who told you...?
Who told me wh...? You've got a fuckin', you've...a...who is this...? You've got a board-up on the window...Moss told me.
Moss...Who told him?
And I don't want any fucking shit and I don't give a shit, Lingk puts me over the top, you filed it, that's fine, any other shit kicks out you go back. You...you reclose it, 'cause I closed it and you...you owe me the car.
Fuck insured. You owe me a car.
Please don't leave. I'm going to talk to you. What's your name?
Aaronow...
Listen to me, the statute, it's for your protection. I have no complaints with that, in fact, I was a member of the board when we drafted it, so quite the opposite. It says that you can change your mind three working days from the time the deal is closed.
Levene!
Which, wait a second, which is not until the check is cashed.
Roma! I'm talking to you...
I've...look. Will someone get this guy off my back.
You have a problem?
Roma, would you, I'd like to get some lunch...
I'm talking with Mr. Lingk. If you please, I'll be back in. I'll be back in a while...I told you, check with Mr. Williamson.
The people downtown said...
You stupid fucking cunt. You, Williamson...I'm talking to you, shithead...You just cost me six thousand dollars. Six thousand dollars. And one Cadillac. That's right. What are you going to do about it? What are you goin to do about it, asshole. You fucking shit. Where did you learn your trade. You stupid fucking cunt. You idiot. Whoever told you you could work with men?
Could I...
I'm going to have your job, shithead. I'm going downtown and talk to Mitch and Murrray, and I'm going to Lemkin. I don't care whose nephew you are, who you know, whose dick you're sucking on. You're going out, I swear to you, you're going...
Hey, fella, let's get this done...
Mr. Levene...?
You're done, come down, and let's...
Would you come in here, please?
Mr. Levene, I think we have to talk.
Hey, hey, hey, easy friend. That's the "Machine." That is Shelly "The Machine" Lev...
John...John...John. Okay. John. John. Look: The Glengarry Highland's leads, you're sending Roma out. Fine. He's a good man. We know what he is. He's fine. All I'm saying, you look at the board, he's throwing...wait, wait, wait, he's throwing them away, he's throwing the leads away. All that I'm saying, that you're wasting leads. I don't want to tell you your job. All that
Shelly, you blew the last...
No. John. No. Let's wait, let's back up here, I did...will you please? Wait a second. Please. I didn't "blow" them. No. I didn't "blow" them. No. One kicked out, one I closed...
...you didn't close...
Shelly...
...and what is that, John? What? Bad luck. That's all it is. I pray in your life you will never find it runs in streaks. That's what it does, that's all it's doing. Streaks. I pray it misses you. That's all I want to say.
What about the other two?
What two?
Four. You had four leads. One kicked out, one the judge, you say...
...you want to see the court records? John? Eh? You want to go down...
...no...
...do you want to go downtown...?
...no...
...then...
...I only...
...then what is this "you say" shit, what is that? What is that...?
What is this "you say"? A deal kicks out...I got to eat. Shit, Williamson, shit. You...Moss... Roma...look at the sheets...look at the sheets. Nineteen eighty, eighty-one...eighty-two...six months of eighty-two...who's there? Who's up there?
Roma.
Under him?
Moss.
Bullshit. John. Bullshit. April, September 1981. It's me. It isn't fucking Moss. Due respect, he's an order taker, John. He talks, he talks a good game, look at the board, and it's me, John, it's me...
Not lately it isn't.
Lately kiss my ass lately. That isn't how you build an org...talk, talk to Murray. Talk to Mitch. When we were on Peterson, who paid for his fucking car? You talk to him. The Seville...? He came in, "You bought that for me Shelly." Out of what? Cold calling. Nothing. Sixty-five, when we were there, with Glen Ross Farms? You call 'em downtown. What
...it isn't you...? Who is it? Who is this I'm talking to? I need the leads...
...after the thirtieth...
Bullshit the thirtieth, I don't get on the board the thirtieth, they're going to can my ass. I need the leads. I need them now. Or I'm gone, and you're going to miss me, John, I swear to you.
Murray...
...you talk to Murray...
I have. And my job is to marshal those leads...
Marshal the leads...marshal the leads? What the fuck, what bus did you get off of, we're here to fucking sell. Fuck marshaling the leads. What the fuck talk is that? What the fuck talk is that? Where did you learn that? In school? That's "talk," my friend, that's "talk." Our job is to sell. I'm the man to sell. I'm getting garbage. You're giving
You're saying that I'm fucked.
Yes. I am. I'm sorry to antagonize you.
...and I'm going to get bounced and you're...
...let me...are you listening to me...?
Yes.
Let me tell you something, Shelly. I do what I'm hired to do. I'm...wait a second. I'm hired to watch the leads. I'm given...hold on, I'm given a policy. My job is to do that. What I'm told. That's it. You, wait a second, anybody falls below a certain mark I'm not permitted to give them the premium leads.
Then how do they come up above that mark? With dreck...? That's nonsense. Explain this to me. 'Cause it's a waste, and it's a stupid waste. I want to tell you something...
You know what those leads cost?
The premium leads. Yes. I know what they cost. John. Because I, I generated the dollar revenue sufficient to buy them. Nineteen senny-nine, you know what I made? Senny-nine? Ninety-six thousand dollars. John? For Murray... For Mitch...look at the sheets...
Murray said...
Money. A fortune. Money lying on the ground. Murray? When was the last time he went out on a sit? Sales contest? It's laughable. It's cold out there now, John. It's tight. Money is tight. This ain't sixty-five. It ain't. It just ain't. See? See? Now, I'm a good man--but I need a...
Murray said...
John. John...
Will you please wait a second. Shelly. Please. Murray told me: the hot leads...
...ah, fuck this...
The...Shelly? The hot leads are assigned according to the board. During the contest. Period. Anyone who beats fifty per...
That's fucked. That's fucked. You don't look at the fucking percentage. You look at the gross.
Either way. You're out.
I'm out.
Yes.
I've seen those leads. I saw them when I was at Homestead, we pitched those cocksuckers Rio Rancho nineteen sixty-nine they wouldn't buy. They couldn't buy a fucking toaster. They're broke, John. They're cold. They're deadbeats, you can't judge on that. Even so. Even so. Alright. Fine. Fine. Even so. I go in, FOUR FUCKING LEADS they got their money in a sock. They're
...they kicked out.
Why?
The leads are assigned randomly...
Bullshit, bullshit, you assign them... What are you telling me?
...apart from the top men on the contest board.
Then put me on the board.
You start closing again, you'll be on the board.
I can't close these leads, John. No one can. It's a joke. John, look, just give me a hot lead. Just give me two of the premium leads. As a "test," alright? As a "test" and I promise you...
Of what?
And what if you don't close.
I will close.
I will close.
What if you don't? Then I'm fucked. You see...? Then it's my job. That's what I'm telling you.
I will close. John, John, ten percent. I can get hot. You know that...
Not lately you can't...
Fuck that. That's defeatist. Fuck that. Fuck it...Get on my side. Go with me. Let's do something. You want to run this office, run it.
Alright.
And fifty bucks a lead.
What are we going to say?
No. You're right. That's for later. We'll talk in a month. What have you got? I want two sits. Tonight.
I'm not sure I have two.
I saw the board. You've got four...
I've got Roma. Then I've got Moss...
Bullshit. They ain't been in the office yet. Give 'em some stiff. We have a deal or not? Eh? Two sits. The Des Plaines. Both of 'em, six and ten, you can do it...six and ten...eight and eleven, I don't give a shit, you set 'em up? Alright? The two sits in Des Plaines.
Alright.
Now? Now?
I wish I could.
You fucking asshole. I haven't got it. I haven't got it, John. I'll pay you tomorrow. I'm coming in here with the sales, I'll pay you tomorrow. I haven't got it, when I pay, the gas...I get back the hotel, I'll bring it in tomorrow.
Can't do it.
I'll give you thirty on them now, I'll bring the rest tomorrow. I've got it at the hotel. John? We do that, for chrissake?
No.
I'm asking you. As a favor to me? John. John: my daughter...
Well, I want to tell you something, fella, wasn't long I could pick up the phone, call Murray and I'd have your job. You know that? Not too long ago. For what? For nothing. "Mur, this new kid burns my ass." "Shelly, he's out." You're gone before I'm back from lunch. I bought him a trip to Bermuda once...
Wait. Alright. Fine. The one. Give me the lead. Give me the one lead. The best one you have.
Why?
Because I say so.
You want to do business that way...? Alright. Alright. Alright. Alright. What is there on the other list...?
You want something off the B list?
Is that what you're saying?
That's what I'm saying. Yeah. I'd like something off the other list. Which, very least, that I'm entitled to. If I'm still working here, which for the moment I guess that I am. What? I'm sorry I spoke harshly to you.
That's alright.
What happened?
Ah, fuck. Leads! Leads! Williamson! Send me out! Send me out!
The leads are coming.
Get 'em to me!
I talked to Murray and Mitch an hour ago. They're coming in, you understand they're a bit upset over this morning's...
How could I tell 'em your sale? Eh? I don't have a tel...I'll tell 'em your sale when they bring in the leads. Alright? Shelly. Alright? We had a little... You closed a deal. You made a good sale. Fine.
It's better than a good sale. It's a...
Look: I have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, I'm trying to make some sense...
All that I'm telling you: that one thing you can tell them it's a remarkable sale.
The only thing remarkable is who you made it to.
What does that fucking mean?
That if the sale sticks, it will be a miracle.
Why should the sale not stick? Hey, fuck you. That's what I'm saying. You have no idea of your job. A man's his job and you're fucked at yours. You hear what I'm saying to you? Your "end of month board..." You can't run an office. I don't care. You don't know what it is, you don't have the sense, you don't have the
Would you? Would you...? Or you're gonna what, fire me?
It's not impossible.
Mmm.
You can't think on your feet you should keep your mouth closed. You hear me? I'm talking to you. Do you hear me...?
Yes. I hear you.
You can't learn that in an office. Eh? He's right. You have to learn it on the streets. You can't buy that. You have to live it.
Mmm.
You are?
Yes, I am.
What are you trying to tell me?
What Roma's trying to tell you. What I told you yesterday. Why you don't belong in this business.
Why I don't...
You listen to me, someday you might say, "Hey..." No, fuck that, you just listen what I'm going to say: your partner depends on you. Your partner...a man who's your "partner" depends on you...you have to go with him and for him...or you're shit, you're shit, you can't exist alone...
Excuse me...
How do you know I made it up?
What?
How do you know I made it up?
What are you talking about?
You said, "You don't make something up unless it's sure to help." How did you know that I made it up?
What are you talking about?
I told the customer that his contracts had gone to the bank.
Well, hadn't it?
No. It hadn't.
Well, I'm saying this, Shel: usually I take the contracts to the bank. Last night I didn't. How did you know that? One night in a year I left a contract on my desk. Nobody knew that but you. Now how did you know that? You want to talk to me, you want to talk to someone else...because this is my job. This is
You're so full of shit.
You robbed the office.
Sure! I robbed the office. Sure.
What'd you do with the leads? You want to go in there? I tell him what I know, he's going to dig up something...You got an alibi last night? You better have one. What did you do with the leads? If you tell me what you did with the leads, we can talk.
I don't know what you are saying.
If you tell me where the leads are, I won't turn you in. If you don't, I am going to tell the cop you stole them, Mitch and Murray will see that you go to jail. Believe me they will. Now, what did you do with the leads? I'm walking in that door--you have five seconds to tell me: or you are going to
I sold them to Jerry Graff.
How much did you get for them? How much did you get for them?
Five thousand. I kept half.
Do I have to tell you? Moss.
It was his idea.
Was it?
I...I'm sure he got more than the five, actually.
Uh-huh?
He told me my share was twenty-five.
Okay: I...look: I'm going to make it worth your while. I am. I turned this thing around. I closed the old stuff, I can do it again. I'm the one's going to close 'em. I am! I am! 'Cause I turned this thing a...I can do that, I can do anyth...last night. I'm going to tell you, I was ready to Do the Dutch.
What?
Wait...uh, look... Look, twelve, twenty, two, twen... twenty-five hundred, it's...take it. Take it all... Take it!
No, I don't think so, Shel.
I...
No, I think I don't want your money. I think you fucked up my office. And I think you're going away.
I...what? Are you, are you, that's why...? Are you nuts? I'm...I'm going to close for you, I'm going to... Here, here, I'm going to make this office...I'm going to be back there Number One...Hey, hey, hey! This is only the beginning...List...list... listen. Listen. Just one moment. List...here's what...here's what we're going to do. Twenty percent. I'm going to give you twenty percent of my
What sales...? I just closed eighty-two grand...Are you fuckin'...I'm back...I'm back, this is only the beginning.
Only the beginning...
Abso...
Where have you been, Shelly? Bruce and Harriet Nyborg. Do you want to see the memos...? They're nuts... they used to call in every week. When I was with Webb. And we were selling Arizona...they're nuts...did you see how they were living? How can you delude yours...
I've got the check...
The check's no good?
You stick around I'll pull the memo for you. I'm busy now...
Their check's no good? They're nuts...?
Call up the bank. I called them.
Don't.
I'm sorry.
Why?
Because I don't like you.
John: John:...my daughter...
You did that?
Those fuckin' deadbeats...
My ass. I told 'em. Listen to this: I said...
Give me some leads. I'm going out... I'm getting out of...
"...you have to believe in yourself..."
Na, fuck the leads, I'm going home.
Hey, they're fuckin' garbage any case...This whole goddamn...
"...You look around, you say, 'This one has so-and-so, and I have nothing..."
Shit.
"'Why? Why don't I get the opportunities...?"
...the fuck is that supposed to mean...?
"You do get the..." Huh? Huh?
Fuck is that supposed to mean?
"You do get the opportunity...You get them. As I do, as anyone does..."
I got 'em in the kitchen. I'm eating her crumb cake.
Rick. Let me tell you. Wait, we're in the...
Dave...
Get the chalk. Get the chalk...get the chalk! I closed 'em! I closed the cocksucker. Get the chalk and put me on the board. I'm going to Hawaii! Put me on the Cadillac board, Williamson! Pick up the fuckin' chalk. Eight units. Mountain View...
You sold eight Mountain View?
Eight units?
That's right.
Shelly...!
Williamson, get on the phone, call Mitch...
They took the phones...
When?
They took the leads?
Just now.
Fuck you, Dave...
Fuck you care...?
How was it...?
From the store.
Fuck her...
"What we have to do is admit to ourself that we see that opportunity...and take it. And that's it." And we sit there. I got the pen out...
"Always be closing..."
That's what I'm saying. The old ways. The old ways...convert the motherfucker...sell him...sell him... make him sign the check. The...Bruce, Harriet...the kitchen, blah: they got their money in government bonds...I say fuck it, we're going to go the whole route. I plat it out eight units. Eighty- two grand. I tell them. "This is now. This is that thing that you've been dreaming of,
Harriett...
The only arrangement I'll accept is full investment. Period. The whole eight units. I know that you're saying 'be safe,' I know what you're saying. I know if I left you to yourselves, you'd say 'come back tomorrow,' and when I walked out that door, you'd make a cup of coffee...you'd sit down...and you'd think 'let's be safe...' and not to disappoint me you'd
Like you taught me...
You closed 'em today?
Yes. I did. This morning. What I'm saying to you: things can change. You see? This is where you fuck up, because this is something you don't know. You can't look down the road. And see what's coming. Might be someone else, John. It might be someone new, eh? Someone new. And you can't look back. 'Cause you don't know history. You ask them.
...yes...
...and you don't remember. 'Cause you weren't around. That's cold calling. Walk up to the door. I don't even know their name. I'm selling something they don't even want. You talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it.
And, and, and, I did it. And I put a kid through school. She...and...Cold calling, fella. Door to door. But you don't know. You don't know. You never heard of a streak. You never heard of "marshaling your sales force..." What are you, you're a secretary, John. Fuck you. That's my message for you. Fuck you and kiss my ass. You don't like it,
Oh, Christ.
The hell with him. We'll go to lunch, the leads won't be up for...
You're a client. I just sold you five waterfront Glengarry Farms. I rub my head, throw me the cue "Kenilworth."
What is it?
I own the property, my mother owns the property, I put her into it. I'm going to show you on the plats. You look when you get home A-3 through A-14 and 26 through 30. You take your time and if you still feel.
Glad to meet you.
I just put Jim into Black Creek...are you acquainted with...
No...Black Creek. Yes. In Florida?
Yes.
I wanted to speak with you about...
Well, we'll do that this weekend.
My wife told me to look into...
Mr. Morton's with American Express... he's... I can tell Jim what you do...?
Sure.
Ray is director of all European sales and services for American Ex... But I'm saying you haven't had a meal until you've tasted...I was at the Lingks' last...as a matter of fact, what was that service feature you were talking about...?
Which...
"Home Cooking"...what did you call it, you said it...it was a tag phrase that you had,,,
Uh...
Home...
Home cooking...
The monthly interview...?
Oh! For the magazine...
Yes. Is this something that I can talk ab...
You're sure?
Go ahead.
Well, Ray was eating at one of his company's men's home in France...the man's French, isn't he?
No, his wife is.
Ah. Ah, his wife is. Ray: what time do you have...?
Twelve-fifteen.
Oh! My God...I've got to get you on the plane!
Didn't I say I was taking the two o'...
No. You said the one. That's why you said we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.
What?
Kenilworth...?
I'm sorry...?
Kenilworth.
Rick...?
Rick...?
Rick...
I've wanted to talk to you for some time. For a long time, actually. I said, "The Machine, there's a man I would work with. There's a man..." You know? I never said a thing. I should have, don't know why I didn't. And that shit you were slinging on my guy today was so good...it...it was, and, excuse me, 'cause it isn't even
Me.
Yeah.
Mm.
Well, you want to swing by the Chinks, watch me eat, we'll talk?
Ricky, I...
Okay, okay, I'll be at the resta...
...all train compartments smell vaguely of shit. It gets so you don't mind it. That's the worst thing that I can confess. You know how long it took me to get there? A long time. When you die you're going to regret the things you don't do. You think you're queer...? I'm going to tell you something: we're all queer. You think that you're
Did I...?
Yes.
Or a piss...? A great meal fades in reflection. Everything else gains. You know why? 'Cause it's only food. This shit we eat, it keeps us going. But it's only food. The great fucks that you may have had. What do you remember about them?
What do I...?
Yes.
Mmmm...
Money? If that's what it signifies to you. Security? Comfort? All it is is THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO YOU. That's all it is. How are they different? Some poor newly married guy gets run down by a cab. Some busboy wins the lottery. All it is, it's a carnival. What's special...what draws us? We're all different. We're not the same. We are not the
Gimlet.
Well, let's have a couple more. My name is Richard Roma, what's yours?
Lingk. James Lingk.
I've got to talk to you.
I've got to talk to you...
It's funny, you know, you get a picture of the Corporation-Type Company Man, all business...this man, no. We'll go out to his home sometime. Let's see. Tomorrow. No. Tomorrow, I'm in L.A....Monday...I'll take you to lunch, where would you like to go?
My wife said I have to cancel the deal.
Monday.
She called the consumer...the attorney, I don't know. The attorney gen...they said we have three days...
Who did she call?
I don't know, the attorney gen... the...some consumer office, um...
I don't know. They said we have three days. They said we have three days.
Three days.
No, I don't know. Tell me.
To change our minds.
Jim, Jim, you saw my book...I can't, you saw my book...
But we have to before Monday. To get our money ba...
Three business days. They mean three business days.
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
I don't understand.
You don't count Saturday.
I'm not.
No, I'm saying you don't include Saturday...in your three days. It's not a business day.
But I'm not counting it. Wednesday. Thursday. Friday. So it would have elapsed.
What would have elapsed?
If we wait till Mon...
When did you write the check?
Yest...
What was yesterday?
Tuesday.
And when was that check cashed?
I don't know.
Today. Today. Which, in any case, it was not, as there were a couple of points on the agreement I wanted to go over with you in any case.
The check wasn't cashed?
I'm very sorry, Jimmy. I apologize to you.
It's not me, it's my wife.
What is?
I told you.
What's going on here?
Tell me again. Your wife.
I told you.
You tell me again.
She wants her money back.
We're going to speak to her.
No. She told me "right now."
We'll speak to her, Jim...
No, no. That's just something she "said." We don't have to do that.
She told me I have to.
No, Jim.
I'm...
Where are you going...? This is me...This is Ricky, Jim. Jim, anything you want, you want it, you have it. You understand? This is me. Something upset you. Sit down, now sit down. You tell me what it is. Am I going to help you fix it? You're goddamned right I am. Sit down. Tell you something...? Sometimes we need someone from outside. It's...no,
I can't regotiate.
What does that mean?
...what, what, say it. Say it to me...
I...
What...?
I...
What...? Say the words.
I don't have the power. I said it.
What power?
The power to negotiate.
To negotiate what? To negotiate what?
This.
The deal.
The "deal," forget the deal. Forget the deal, you've got something on your mind, Jim, what is it?
What? What? What, Jim: I tell you what, let's get out of here...let's go get a drink.
She told me not to talk to you.
Let's...no one's going to know, let's go around the corner and we'll get a drink.
She told me I had to get back the check or call the State's att...
What?
And the check is...
What are the police doing?
It's nothing.
You cashed the check?
Fuckin' asshole.
What, they beat you with a rubber bat?
Cop couldn't find his dick two hands and a map. Anyone talks to this guy's an asshole...
You going to turn State's?
Guess what the Machine did?
Fuck the Machine.
Mountain View. Eight units.
Fuckin' cop's got no right talk to me that way. I didn't rob the place...
You hear what I said?
Yeah. He closed a deal.
Eight units. Mountain View.
Fuck you.
Guess who?
You just this morning...
We haven't got a lead...
Why not?
It means, Dave, you haven't closed a good one in a month, none of my business, you want to push me to answer you. And so you haven't got a contract to get stolen or so forth.
Bring that shit up. Of my volume. You were on a bad one and I brought it up to you you'd harbor it. You'd harbor it a long long while. And you'd be right.
Who said "Fuck the Machine"?
Is that what I did? Dave? I humiliated you? My God...I'm sorry...
Sittin' on top of the world, sittin' on top of the world, everything's fucking peachfuzz...
I'll show you how to chew it." Your pal closes, all that comes out of your mouth is bile, how fucked up you are...
Who's my pal...? And what are you, Ricky, huh, what are you, Bishop Sheean? Who the fuck are you, Mr. Slick...? What are you, friend to the workingman? Big deal. Fuck you, you got the memory a fuckin' fly. I never liked you.
What is this, your farewell speech?
I'm going home.
Your farewell to the troops?
I'm not going home. I'm going to Wisconsin.
Have a good trip.
They didn't get your contract. I filed it before I left.
They didn't get my contracts.
They didn't get the contracts.
Did they...
They got, listen to me...
Listen to me: They got some of them.
They took some of the con...
...some of the contracts...Lingk. James Lingk. I closed...
You closed him yesterday.
Yes.
It went down. I filed it.
You did?
Yes.
Then I'm over the fucking top and you owe me a Cadillac.
Where are you going?
To the restaura...what do you fucking...?
Aren't you going out today?
With what? With what, John, they took the leads...
I have the stuff from last year's...
...you want to go out today...?
Patel? Ravidam Patel? How am I going to make a living on thses deadbeat wogs? Where did you get this, from the morgue?
If you don't want it, give it back.
I don't "want" it, if you catch my drift.
I'm giving you three leads. You...
What's the fucking point in any case...? What's the point. I got to argue with you, I got to knock heads with the cops, I'm busting my balls, sell you dirt to fucking deadbeats money in the mattress, I come back you can't even manage to keep the contracts safe, I have to go back and close them again...What the fuck am I wasting
The word from Murray is: leave them alone. If we need a new signature he'll go out himself, he'll be the president, just come in, from out of town...
Three? I count two.
Three.
Yes.
Mr. Lingk and I are going to...
We had a slight burglary last night.
It was nothing...I was assuring Mr. Lingk...
Mr. Lingk. James Lingk. Your contract went out. Nothing to...
John...
...Mr. Williamson...
...I wouldn't worry about it.
Are you alright?
Yes.
Did you like your party?
I got lots of presents.
Do you like them?
I didn't know the people who gave them to me.
Did you see my present for you?
No, where is it?
On your pillow.
I'm leaving very early tomorrow, before you wake up.
I know. How long will you be gone?
Just a few days.
Will you take me?
I can't.
Why do you have to go?
To do business.
I can help you.
You've grown so tall... so tall in the last year. You're much taller than me.
I was taller than you when I was fourteen.
Sit down. Your Aunt Connie and I waited for you to have some lunch, but now it's all dried out.
I'm not hungry.
Mr. Cicci. From the year 1927 to the present time, you were an employee of the &quot;Genco Olive Oil Company.&quot;
That's right.
But in actuality, you were a member of the Corleone Crime organization.
The Corleone Family, Senator. We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;
What position did you occupy?
I have a friend who has a fine rug. Maybe your wife would like it.
We have no money for a rug.
Your friend lives in a fine building.
They say Fanucci has a license from Maranzalla himself to work this neighborhood.
Fanucci is not connected; he is alone.
What? You read it in the papers?
Who is the greatest man you can think of?
What took so long?
Do you think he'd be satisfied with the two hundred dollars? I think he would.
That scar-faced bastard will find out what we got from the wholesaler. He won't take a dime less than three hundred dollars.
What if we don't pay?
You know his friends...real animals. And his connections with the police. Sure he'd like us to tell him our plans so he can set us up for the cops and earn their gratitude. Then they would owe him a favor; that's how he operates. We'll have to pay. Three hundred, are we agreed?
Vitone! Our driver has drunk too much wine.
He's going to kill Fanucci.
Constanzia. We expected you last week; we sent the car to pick you up at the airport last week.
I know, it was chaos; but anyway, here I am one week late. This is for my Mama. You remember Merle?
Yes, thank you.
How are the kids?
Well, thank you, they asked for you all week.
I got surprises for everybody!
Bought at the airport.
This is swell. Where's Michael? I've got things to get straight with him and I can't wait on line.
It means we should all live happily for one hundred years. The family. If my Father were alive, it'd be true.
Connie.
How are you, honey? You've met Merle, haven't you. He was with me in Vegas.
I saw him with you.
We're going to Europe next week. I want to get passage booked on the Queen.
The ink on your divorce isn't dry. Your children see you on weekends; your oldest boy, Michael Francis... was in some trouble with the Reno police over some petty theft that you don't even know about.
Michael...
You fly around the world with lazy young men who don't have any love for you, and use you like a whore.
You're not my father!
Then why do you come to me?
Because I need MONEY!
Connie, I want to be reasonable with you. You have a house here, with us. You can live here with your kids...and you won't be deprived of anything. I don't know much about Merle; I don't know what he does for a living; what he lives on. Why don't you tell him marriage is really out of the question; and that you can't see
Is Kay coming?
No.
Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama. He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you.
Tom is right.
I want to talk to you, Michael.
The children can stay.
Honey! Wait a minute; let's go for a drive.
I just had a drive; besides, I want to see my brother-in-law Michael.
Goddamn bitch.
Listen, Michael's got a lot of nice people here. Friends of Kay's. He'll never forgive me if you ruin his party.
I hate to see you cringe in front of him. How come you're so scared of your own kid brother?
What's 'cent' Anne?'
I wanta dance...whatsa matter with that?
Dancing is alright; you're falling on the floor.
Whatsamatter, you don't want me to dance with him 'cause he's a man!
Deanna, I'm going to belt you right in the mouth!
Deanna, will you get back into the house!
I don't want to stay here...
Would you like some?
No, Dad.
Now what is this talk about joining the army? Eh?
It's not talk; I'm doing it.
You would risk your life for strangers?
Not for strangers; for my country.
Anyone not in your family, is a stranger. Believe me, when trouble comes, your country won't take care of you.
That's how it was in the old world, Pop, but this is not Sicily.
Don Francesco. You murdered my husband, because he would not bend. And his oldest son Paolo, because he swore revenge. But Vitone is only nine, and dumb-witted. He never speaks.
I'm not afraid of his words.
He is weak.
He will grow strong.
The child cannot harm you.
Otherwise the police will come to see you and your wife and children will be dishonored and destitute. Of course, if my information as to your gains is incorrect, I'll dip my beak just a little. Just a little, but no less than one hundred dollars, and don't try to deceive me, eh paisan?
My two friends have my share of the money. I'll have to speak to them after we deliver these to the wholesaler.
You tell your friends I expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner. Don't be afraid to tell them. Clemenza and I know each other well, he understands these things. Let yourself be guided by him. He has more experience in these matters.
You must understand, this is all new to me...
I understand...
But thank you for speaking to me as a Godfather.
I think there's only two hundred dollars under my hat. I'm right. Only two hundred dollars.
I'm a little short. I've been out of work. Let me owe you the money for a few weeks.
Ten to one shot, you said. Ten to one shot in my favor, and I lose.
Get a good night's sleep. We got a new suit, new shirt, new tie, and I'm going to shave you myself. Tomorrow we want you to look respectable for fifty million of your fellow Americans.
My life won't be worth a nickel after tomorrow.
We have a special home for you for the rest of your life. Nobody gets near you. You're not going any place.
Why'd you do it, Frankie? After all these years, why'd you turn against him?
Ready, Frankie.
Who's that? Pentangeli? Frankie &quot;Five-Angels&quot;...thought you were never coming West.
Gee, Frankie, it's good to see you. Reminds me of old times.
You remember Willy Cicci, don't you, Freddie? We was all together with the old man Clemenza in Brooklyn... before...uh...
We were all upset about that.
That's what I'm here to talk to your brother about. What's with him, I got to get a letter of introduction to have a 'sitdown'?
Hey Mike, what can I say?
Hiya, Freddie Corleone.
Oh, 'scuse me.
It's all right. He stays with me all the time.
Oh. Mikey, what's up? I'm totally in the dark.
We're making an investment in Havana.
Great, Havana's great. Lots of activity in Havana! Anybody I know here. Five-Angels? Anybody?
Johnny Ola... Hyman Roth.
I never met them.
Pentangeli's dead. He was ambushed by the Rosato Brothers. Didn't you know that?
No. No, I didn't. Who tells me anything? I been kept in the dark so long, I'm getting used to it.
I want you to help me, Fredo.
That's what I'm here for.
Tonight I want to relax with you. The Senator from Nevada is here with some people from Washington. I want to show them a good time in Havana.
Count on me; that's my specialty.
I'd like to come along. There's been a lot of strain, and I've been cooped up in this room for three days.
Jeeze, it's great you came along, Mike... You know, we've never spent a night out on the town together. I always thought you looked down on me for liking a good time.
Mike, I got something special up my sleeve for these boys. You ever hear of &quot;Superman?&quot; And I don't mean the comic book.
No.
Mikey, why would they ever hit poor old Frankie Five-Angels? I loved that ole sonuvabitch. I remember when he was just a 'button,' when we were kids. We used to put bedsheets on our heads, you know, like we were ghosts. An' ole Frankie come peek into our room, we'd jump up, and he'd always pretend like he was really scared. You remember?
It was hard to have him killed.
You? What do you mean you, I thought...
It was hard to have him killed.
You? What do you mean you, I thought...
It was Frankie tried to have me hit.
No. I mean, are you sure?
You know otherwise, Freddie?
How is your wife, Fredo...your marriage?
&quot;Yo soy un hombre sincero...&quot; I am a sincere man, From the land of the palms...
What's that?
The song. Are you sincere with me, Fredo?
Sincere. What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike.
Then I'm going to confide in you; trust you with something.
Mike, are you crazy, I'm your brother.
Tonight we've been invited to a reception at the Presidential Palace; to bring in the New Year. You and I will go in a special car that's being sent. They'll have cocktails... then dinner, and a reception with the President. When it's over, it will be suggested that you take Questadt and his friends from Washington to spend the night with some women. I'll
...Who?
The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.
But, you told me yourself...
It was never Pentangeli... I've always known that. It was Roth all along. He talks to me as a son; as his successor, but the old man thinks he'll live forever.
What do you want me to do?
To go tonight, with me, as though we know nothing. I've already made my move.
What is it? Can I help?
Fredo. Where are you going?
I don't have a lot to say, Michael.
We have time.
I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much.
What about now, is there anything you can help me out with?
I didn't know it was a hit. I swear to you I didn't know. Johnny Ola contacted me in Beverly Hills -- said he wanted to talk. He said you and Roth were in on some big deal, and there was a place for me in it if I could help them out. They said you were being tough on the negotiation, and if
And you believed that story.
He said there was something good in it for me...me on my own.
I've always taken care of you.
Taken care of me. Mike, you're my kid brother, and you take care of my. Did you ever think of that. Ever once? Send Fredo off to do this, send Fredo to take care of that... take care of some little unimportant night club here, and there; pick somebody up at the airport. Mike, I'm your older brother; I was stepped over!
It's the way Pop wanted it.
It wasn't the way I wanted it! I can handle things. I'm not dumb Christ, not like everyone says. I'm smart; and I want respect.
There's nothing more you can tell me about this investigation?
The lawyer; Questadt, he belongs to Roth.
I know what you are thinking, Vitone, but you don't understand yet how things are. Fanucci is of the Black Hand. Everyone in the neighborhood pays him, even my father.
He's an Italian?
Why? Why does he bother other Italians?
Because he knows them; he knows they have no one to protect them. Vitone? What do you think of my angel?
Beautiful.
Beautiful.
For you, she is beautiful. For me, there is only my wife!
I bet you can't guess what happened?
What?
Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped Fanucci today; slit his throat from ear to ear.
No, I didn't know. Is he dead?
Nah. Those guys aren't murderers. They wanted to scare him, that's all. Make him look bad.
In Sicily, when you attack a man, you had better finish him.
I wish they had. He takes fifty dollars a week from my father's cash drawer. But you can't kill a man like Fanucci.
Why?
What did I tell you. The one who cut him was found in an alley. And the family of the others paid Fanucci all their savings to make him forswear his vengeance.
And he agreed?
The 'patrone' is here.
Chi?
It's Michael's request...for your safety. We can send out for anything you need.
I'm supposed to stay in my house.
Within the compound will be fine.
I was supposed to take the children to New England next week.
That's off now.
I'm going to see my parents.
Kay, Michael didn't tell me a lot; and what he did tell me, I can't repeat. But the responsibility for you and the kids was the most important thing he left me with.
How long does this go on?
I don't know. I'm sorry, Kay...
Am I a prisoner?
... He said he had shot his Grandfather with a gun, and then he died in the garden. And he asked me... he asked me, Tom, if that meant now his father would shoot him out of... revenge. How does a four year old boy learn the word... 'revenge'?
Kay... Kay...
What kind of a family is this... are we human beings? He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo. He heard Connie.
You don't know that's true. But Kay, just for the sake of an argument, let's assume it is, I'm not saying it is, remember, but... What if I gave you what might be some justification for what he did... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did.
That's the first time I've seen the lawyer side of you, Tom. It's not your best side.
Okay, just hear me out. What if Carlo had been paid to help get Sonny killed? What if his beating of Connie that time was a deliberate plot to get Sonny out into the open? Then what? And what if the Don, a great man, couldn't bring himself to do what he had to do, avenge his son's death by killing his daughter's husband?
He's not the same as when I met him.
If he were, he'd be dead by now. You'd be a widow. You'd have no problem.
If you told Michael what I've told you today, I'm a dead man.
When is it finally over? I want it to be over before my baby is born.
Where's my wife?
He doesn't want my help any more. He doesn't need it.
We don't know that's true, he never said that.
Just now when Johnny Ola showed up, he asked me to leave them alone. Ola is Hyman Roth's Sicilian contact. I was on the inside of ten, twenty meetings with him. But today Mike asked me to leave, like an outsider.
Talk to him. Tell him how you feel.
Hello?
What do you mean gone?
The Barretts from Rubicon Bay came by in a new speedboat. Rocco tried to say she wasn't in, but Kay spotted them and asked if they would take her and the kids for a ride. That was three hours ago.
Why didn't someone tell me!
You're going to talk to him now.
Yes.
Will you tell him?
Rocco!
I know. I went down to the Barrett house. But she's gone. They drove her and the kids to North Tahoe airport.
Goddamn it, where were you?
She took a flight to San Francisco. We figure she's going to connect to New Hampshire; her parents' place.
Me too, Tom?
I'm sorry; of course, you know that.
Two-thirty. That gives me time to see my boy.
Tom isn't going to sit in with us, Johnny. He only handles specific areas of the family business. Tom?
If you need anything, just...
There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom. I know that's upset you in the past; and you've felt that it was because of some lack of trust or confidence. But it is because I do trust you that I've kept so much secret from you. It's precisely that at this moment, you are the only one that I can completely trust. In time,
But your people... Neri... Rocco; you don't think...
Mikey, I hoped...
I've prepared this; have had it for over a month. It won't explain everything; but indicates where I will be, so in a sense, it is my life. Also, there are three tasks that must be executed immediately. Pop would have given those to Luca -- You knew Pop as well as anyone, act as though you were him. It discusses Kay as well;
Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
I don't think so. Unless I'm very wrong...they're already dead. Killed by someone inside...very frightened that they botched it. That's why I am going to disappear in a few minutes, and leave everything to you.
But if you're wrong...
Do you think they have somebody to back up Cicci?
Did the boy get something from me for Christmas?
I took care of it.
What was it, so I'll know.
Where's my brother?
Roth got out on a private boat. He's in a hospital in Miami. Had a stroke but he's recovered okay. Bussetta's dead.
I asked about Fredo?
The new government arrested him, held him for a couple of days with a lot of the other casino people, including Roth's brother, Sam. The American Embassy arranged flights for citizens; I'm not sure, but I think he's somewhere in New York.
I want you to reach Fredo. I know he's scared, but have one of our people reach him. Assure him that there will be no reprisals. Tell him that I know Roth misled him.
My information is that Fredo thought it was a kidnapping. Roth assured him nothing would happen to you.
They can come in now.
Wait... there's something else.
Go on, tell me.
Was it a boy or a girl?
Mike, at three and a half...
What is it, can't you give me straight answers anymore!
It was a boy.
And Kay...she's all right?
She took the Senate Investigation worse.
Does she blame it on me? The baby?
How did they get their hands on Pentangeli?
He says he doesn't know anything, and I believe him. Roth played this one beautifully.
Sit down, Tom. Have you heard about our friend and partner, Mr. Hyman Roth?
They won't take him; not for a million, not for ten million.
His medical condition is reported as... &quot;terminal.&quot;
He's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years.
That plane goes to Miami...
I want it met.
Mike, it's impossible. He'll be met by the Internal Revenue; the Customs Service, and half the FBI.
I don't like it when you use the word impossible; nothing is impossible...
Mike, it would be like trying to kill the President; there's no way we can get to him.
I'm surprised at you, Tom. If there's anything certain; certain in life; if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill... ANYBODY. But perhaps your relucatance is because you've come to tell me that you're moving your family to Vegas, that you've been offered the Vice-Presidency of the Houstan Hotels there. Or weren't you going to tell me at all?
Are you so hungry for traitors; do you want to find them everywhere?
They are everywhere!
I turned Houstan down; I didn't see why I should tell you about an offer I turned down. Are you sure, Mikey? Are you sure of what we're doing; what we'll gain; what does the family gain? Forget that, Mike; I already know the answer.
I know you do, Tom. Then I can count on you to help me do the things I have to do. If not, call Houstan, and become a Vice-President. Take your family and your mistress and move them to Las Vegas.
Why do you hurt me, Michael? I've always been loyal to you.
Good. Then you're staying.
Fifteen percent skim?
It might show.
We've never sent this much with one courier.
What's up?
No questions.
I got to ask questions, Tom, there's three million dollars cash in that pouch; Mike is gone and I have no word from him.
Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Don.
The High Court of Israel turned down his request to live as a 'returned Jew.' His passport's been invalidated except for return to the U.S. He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday, offered a gift of one million dollars if they would give him citizenship. They turned him down.
I think I prefer to see my client privately.
The room has a bug in it.
Everything is going to be okay, Frankie, don't worry.
Did my brother go back?
Yeah, but don't worry.
He's ten times tougher than me, my brother. He's old-fashioned.
Yeah. He wouldn't even go out to dinner. Just wanted to go home.
That's my brother. Nothing could get him away from that two mule town. He coulda been big over here -- he could of had his own Family.
You're right.
Frankie, you were always interested in politics, in history. I remember you talking about Hitler back in '43. We were young then.
Yeah, I still read a lot. They bring me stuff.
You were around the old timers who dreamed up how the Families should be organized, how they based it on the old Roman Legions, and called them 'Regimes'... with the 'Capos' and 'Soldiers,' and it worked.
Yeah, it worked. Those were great old days. We was like the Roman Empire. The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire.
The Roman Empire... when a plot against the Emperor failed, the plotters were always given a chance to let their families keep their fortunes.
Yeah, but only the rich guys. The little guys got knocked off. If they got arrested and executed, all their estate went to the Emperor. If they just went home and killed themselves, up front, nothing happened.
Don't worry about anything, Frankie Five-Angels.
...and the tape will be running.
What the hell are you talking about?
We know you're a busy man, with plenty of enemies -- we saw the opportunity to do you a favor, and we did. No strings.
No strings.
You know there's a Senate Investigating Committee recently set up; we thought it would be unfortunate if they were to trace anything though-provoking to your name.
No one can trace anything to me; I pride myself on that.
Do you gamble?
A little; what's so thought- provoking about that?
Do you owe markers?
There's thirty grand worth of paid off markers -- I never owed that much.
Our mistake. But what does it matter; it was our money. We don't even expect thanks.
You paid off thirty grand I never owed.
We'll keep it quiet; the people who know are trustworthy...the Committee needn't find out.
And what's the price of their not finding out.
Simple. Be friendly like us. Not hostile.
Senator, my client would like to read a statement for the record.
I don't think that's necessary.
Sir, my client has answered every question asked by this committee with the utmost cooperation and sincerity. He has not taken that Fifth Amendment as it was his right to do, and which because of the extreme legal complexity of this hearing, counsel advised him to do. So, I think in all fairness this committee should hear his statement and put it in the
Mr. Hagen, would you kindly identify to this committee that gentleman sitting on your right hand?
Yes, sir. His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
Is he related to the witness?
Sir, the gentleman does not understand English. He would not in any case, take the stand. He came, at his own expense, to aid his brother in his trouble. He is not under any jurisdiction of our government and his reputation in his own country is impeccable.
Senator Kane.
This meeting is adjourned.
This committee owes an apology!
Yes.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone. We're not to let you through.
I'm going to the market.
If you could just give us a list, we'll pick up anything you want.
Whose orders are these?
Anthony, Daddy's busy.
This is my boy, and my wife. Mr. John Ola of Miami.
I'm sorry, Michael. Senator Geary's here, and Mr. and Mrs. Barrett wanted to thank you before they left. Won't you join us, Mr. Ola?
Kay.
How's the baby?
Sleeping inside me.
Does it feel like a boy?
Yes, Michael, it does.
I'm sorry about some of the people I had to see today. It was bad timing... but it couldn't be helped.
Leave her alone! You're talking as though she has no right to be frightened when there are machine guns going off in her backyard.
I had no idea...
I wanted to see you before you went back to Nevada. Also, the children - Michael, they're here.
Where?
In a minute. They're outside with Esther. I'm very happy for you... I suppose I knew that you're simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you.
Why don't you sit down?
I'm not going to stay long; I can't.
There are a lot of things I want to talk to you about. Things I've been thinking about -- changes I want to make.
I think it's too late for changes, Michael. I promised myself I wouldn't talk about it and I've gone and spoiled it.
Why too late?
Tell me, Michael. What really happened with Pentangeli?
His brother came to help him.
I didn't even know he had a brother. And where is he now?
On a plane back to Sicily.
And that's all he had to do. Just show his face.
That's all. You see, in Sicily, in the old days... there was only one legitimate reason to kill a blood relative... only one. IF he was a traitor.
You would have killed his brother?
When he saw his brother in the hearing room, he knew what was at stake. I don't think Vincenzo would have done it. He loves the kids, too. Omerta, Kay. Honor, silence. It had nothing to do with me. It was between those brothers.
I'll bring the children up now; they want to say goodbye.
Kay, I told you...
Goodbye, Michael.
I won't let you leave! Christ, do you think I'm going to let you leave.
Michael.
No, I don't want to hear anything. There are things between men and women that will not change; things that have been the same for thousands of years. You are my wife, and they are my children... and I love you and I will not let you leave, because you are MINE!
Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless. You held me a prisoner once; will you try again?
If that's what it takes; then yes, I will.
At this moment, I feel no love for you at all. I never thought that could happen, but it has.
We'll go back tonight. Bring the children.
How can I let you leave; how can I let you take my children away? Don't you know me? You understand, it's an impossibility. I would never let it happen; no, never, not if it took all my strength, all my cunning. But in time, soon, you'll feel differently. You see, you'll be happy that I stopped you. I know you. You'll forget about
The baby I lost...
I know what it meant... and I'm prepared to make it up to you. I will make changes; I can. I CAN change; that I have learned, that I have the strength to change... And we have another child, a boy... and you'll forget the miscarriage.
Are you Klingman?
Who's asking?
Where can we talk?
Right here.
I represent the interests of the Corleone family. We make the invitation to you to tie up your affairs and be out of the hotel by Monday morning.
Who do you think you're talking to?
You said you were Klingman.
You don't come in here, talk to an owner in Las Vegas like that.
You missed my point; you are no longer an owner.
It's Michael. How are you, Mom?
I'm alright. Will you stay home for awhile?
There are still things I have to do.
Well, we can all have a nice dinner together tonight. How are your eyes?
Alright. They bother me once in awhile. Tell me, when Pop had troubles... did he ever think, even to himself, that he had gone the wrong way; that maybe by trying to be strong and trying to protect his family, that he could... that he could... lose it instead?
You talk about the baby. She can have another baby.
No, I meant lose his family.
Your family? How can you ever lose your family?
Sit down, this is almost over. You follow the baseball games?
Not for a few years.
I like sporting events -- I really enjoy watching them in the afternoon. One of the things I love about this country. I loved baseball ever since Arnold Rothstein fixed the World Series of 1919...I heard you had some trouble.
Yes.
What a mistake; people behaving like that, with guns. It was my understanding we left all that behind. But, let me tell you, the important thing is that you're all right. Good health is the most important thing; more than success; more than power; more than money.
The incident of the other night is a nuisance that I can take care of. I came to you because I want nothing to affect our agreement; I wanted to clear everything I'm going to do with you, just in case.
You're a considerate young man.
You're a great man, Mr. Roth, I have much to learn from you.
However I can help you...
The Rosato Brothers have performed services for you in the past; I understand that they are under your protection.
We do favors for each other...
Nothing is more important.
Pentangeli is a dead man; do you object?
It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.
Then it's done. I must choose his replacement: it cannot be Rosato.
I still don't speak Spanish, Michael.
Enjoy.
You have to be careful what you say in front of the others... they frighten easy. It's always been that way, most men frighten easy.
We're making a big investment in Cuba. That's my only concern.
My concern is that the three million never arrived at Batista's numbered account in Switzerland. He thinks it's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels.
The money was sent.
Then you have to trace it. Michael, people here look at me as a reliable man. I can't afford not to be looked on as a reliable man. But you know all that; there's nothing you can learn from me. You shouldn't have to put up with a sick old man as a partner.
I wouldn't consider anyone else.
If only I could live to see it, kid; to be there with you. How beautifully we've done it, step by step. Here, protected, free to make our profits without the Justice Department, the FBI; ninety miles away in partnership with a friendly government. Ninety miles, just a small step, looking for a man who desperately wants to be President of the United States,
This doubles my investment.
Still no word of your courier? We'll find him. But at least this will satisfy our friends here. You've been invited to the New Year reception at the Presidential Home. I understand your brother is here as well; I hope he'll come.
You're a careful kid, and that's good. But look. An international dispatch on the wire service. American journalism, not propaganda. The government troops have all but eliminated the rebels. All but their radio station.
I've read it; I'm pleased that the government is doing so well. As a heavy investor, I'm pleased. How did the doctor find you?
Terrible. I'd give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting.
Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?
Why...the Rosato Brothers.
I know it wasn't me...so that leaves you.
Hiya, Mr. Corleone, I'm Sam Roth. Welcome to the Capri; my brother's upstairs. You wanta take a rest before you see him, or can I get you something, anything at all?
This is it! We think it makes Vegas look like the corner crap game.
Very impressive.
It occurred to me: the police are paid to fight, and the Rebels are not.
So?
You know my lawyer, Tom Hagen. Johnny Ola.
I just left our friend in Miami.
How is his health?
Not good.
Is there anything I can do; anything I can send?
The hotel's registered owners are one Jacob Lawrence, and Sidney Barclay, both Beverly Hills attorneys. In reality it's split between the Old Lakeville Road Group from Cleveland, and our friend in Miami. He takes care of others outside the country, you know who I mean. Meyer Klingman runs the store, and does all right, but I've been instructed to tell you, that if you
He's very kind, tell him it's appreciated. I'm sure it will be profitable all the way around.
They asked him to sign paper to take down the markers; but he got mad; told them to wait until he was finished.
Let him gamble.
Are you the son of Vito Corleone?
I'm sure we all agree with our esteemed colleague. Now, Mr. Corleone, you have been advised as to your legal rights. We have had testimony from a preceding witness who states you are head of the most powerful Mafia family in this country. Are you?
No.
This witness has testified that you are personally responsible for the murder of a New York Police Captain in the year 1947 and with him a man named Virgil Sollozzo. Do you deny this?
I deny his every charge.
Is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the Five Families in New York, to assume and consolidate your nefarious power?
That is a complete falsehood.
Is it true that you own a controlling interest in three of the major hotels in Las Vegas?
Mr. Corleone, do you have any hotel interests in the state of Arizona? Or any gambling interests in that state?
I do not.
Do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of New York.
I know.
When do we talk?
Sure, Pete Clemenza died of a heart attack, but the Rosato Brothers gave it to him.
We were all heartbroken at the news; but that wasn't cause to start a war.
Okay, now it's my family in Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up Clemenza's loyalty to you. But how can I run my family with you challenging my every move? You're too far from the street, Mike, the only way to reason with the Rosato Brothers is to whack 'em and whack 'em fast.
You were unfair with them.
Says who?
Clemenza promised Rosato three territories in the Bronx after he died, and then you took over and welched.
Clemenza promised them nothing, he hated the sonsuvbitches.
They feel cheated.
Michael, you're sitting up here in the Sierra Mountains with champagne cocktails making judgment on the way I run my family.
Your family still carries the name Corleone, and you will run it like a Corleone!
And while I feed my family in New York, you put the knife in my back in Miami.
Frankie, you're a good old man, and you've been loyal to my Father for years...so I hope you can explain what you mean.
The Rosatos are running crazy; taking hostages, spitting in my face, because they're backed by the Jew in Miami.
I know. That's why I want you to be fair with them.
How can you be fair with animals? They recruit niggers and spicks; they do violence in their own Grandmother's neighborhoods. And everything is dope and whores; the gambling is left to last. Let me run my family without you on my back. I want them taken care of.
No. There are things that I have planned with Hyman Roth. I don't want them disturbed.
You give your loyalty to a Jew over your own blood.
Frankie, you know my father respected Roth, did business with him.
Don Corleone, I wish you let me know you was coming. We could have prepared something for you.
I didn't want you to know I was coming. You heard what happened in my home?
Michael, yes, we was all relieved...
I want you to help me take my revenge.
Michael, anything. What is it I can do for you?
I want you to settle these troubles with the Rosato Brothers.
I was just going to contact you, Michael; we just had a 'sit-down' - in fact, I just come from there.
I want you to settle on their terms.
Mike, I don't understand. Don't ask me to do that.
Trust me; do as I ask.
It would be the beginning of the end for my family. How can I keep all my other territories in like if I let two wise-guys stand up and demand this and that, and then give it to them?
Frankie...do you respect me? Do I have your loyalty?
Always... But sometimes I don't understand. I know I'll never have your kind of brains, in big deals. But Mike, this is a street thing. And Hyman Roth in Miami is behind the Rosato Brothers.
I know.
Then why do you want me to lay down to them?
Frankie, Roth tried to have me killed. I'm sure it was him, but I don't know yet why.
Jesus Christ, Michael, then let's hit 'em now, while we still got the muscle.
This was my father's old study. When I was a kid, we had to be quiet when we played near here. When I was older, I learned many things from him here. I was happy that this house never went to strangers; first Clemenza took it over, and then you. My father taught me, in this room, never to act until you know everything
Sure, Mike. I'll go along.
My lawyer, Tom Hagen. He arranged this all through your man Turnbull.
I thought we would meet alone.
I trust these men with my life. They are my right arms; I cannot insult them by sending them away.
The Corleone family controls two major hotels in Vegas; one in Reno. The licenses were grandfathered in, so you had no difficulties with the Gaming Commission. But I have the idea from sources... ...that you're planning to move in on the Tropicana. In another week or so you'll move Klingman out, which leaves you with only one technicality. The license, which is now in
Turnbull is a good man.
Senator Geary, I speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state. I have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here. The license fee from the Gambling Commission costs one thousand dollars; why would I ever consider paying more?
We're all part of the same hypocrisy, Senator. But never think it applies to my family.
They're still on the property. Maybe you better stay inside.
We'll try.
Your family all seem to be okay in the other houses; your Mother's still sleeping.
And?
On the phone?
Rosato, where's your brother?
He don't want to talk?
We worked it all out beforehand.
Are we going to eat or what?
Sure, on me. I got Diner's Club.
Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite. You're making big trouble, Carmine.
You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
We could have talked first, saved a lot of running around.
You wasn't listening, you didn't want to talk.
Don't I look like I'm listening?
We want Brooklyn one hundred percent. No more taxes to you. We want to be only loosely connected with your family -- sort of a under-family all of our own. Then we can act on all internal matters without talking. Also we want you to inform Michael Corleone that we can deal directly with him.
I'm a little hungry, maybe I'll order something. Joe. Get me some bracciole or something. And pay cash. And in return for these concessions, what do you do for me?
We will release the hostages, number one. Number two, we're here for you to count on when you need us. We're independent, but we're here if you need us. In general, we'll cooperate with you and your businesses, and you in turn will cooperate with us. Pari persu.
Pari Persu; what the fuck is Pari persu...?
My lawyer went over this beforehand.
What assurances do I have that there will be no more kidnapping, no more hits?
The same assurance we got from you.
What if I say shove it?
Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue DeRosa will need to be fitted for slabs.
You want a war?
We got no choice.
You know if there's a way I'll go to the commission and the commission will side with me. That puts me and the other New York families against you.
We got friends in the commission.
I'm talking about Italians!
What about Michael Corleone?
He supports me.
What's this?
I have already rented the apartment to another family.
I told her I would speak to you, that you are a reasonable man who acted out of some misunderstanding. She has gotten rid of the animal that caused all the trouble, so why shouldn't she stay. As one Italian to another, I ask you the favor.
I've already rented it; I cannot disappoint the new tenants. They're paying a higher rent.
How much more a month?
Here is the six month's increase in advance. You needn't speak to her about it, she's a proud woman. See me again in another six months. But of course, you'll let her keep her dog.
Excuse me, I hope I am not a disturbance, Don Corleone.
Yes.
Your good heart in helping the poor widow has shamed me, and I want to show that I, too, have some Christian charity. Her rent will remain what it was.
What was that?
I accept your generosity...
Thanks, doll.
I say let loverboy watch his movie. And be grateful Boone's not cutting Shirley Temple's lawn.
What makes you say that?
Just thinking out loud.
Yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself.
All right, then. He's interested in you for your conversation. We know what a great talker you are.
Fuck you.
Not anymore you don't. Doll.
This looks corny.
These old movies are such a hoot. They thought they were being scary, but they're just funny.
Maybe it's supposed to be funny.
So what did you think?
You know what? I think you guys are all jealous.
What's to be jealous of?
I've gotten to know someone who's famous.
Not so famous any of us have ever heard of him.
What's that mean?
It means it's too cold to go swimming. And I don't mean the water.
I wasn't going to try anything.
This old guy -- he's the kind of person I expected to meet when I moved out here. Someone who's done things with his life.
Do you realize you're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me?
It's different. He's a man. And by the way you have no business calling him a homo.
It never crossed your mind?
He's an artist. Anyway, he's too old to think about sex.
You picked up that girl right in front of me.
Hey, no strings, right? That's what you always said. Just good pals who have the hots for each other.
It still hurt. A lot.
I didn't mean to...
No, I'm actually kind of glad it happened. It made me wonder what the hell I was doing with my life. Letting you pull me into bed whenever the spirit moved you.
You liked it too.
Sure. I loved it.
If you enjoy it, you should do it.
You know, I just can't do that anymore. I still have time to get things right. Get married again --
The look on your face! You're not marriage material. You're not even boyfriend material. You're a kid. A big, fun, slightly irresponsible kid.
I'm not a kid.
I like my life. I'm a free man.
So you don't want to fuck. That's what you're telling me?
Is that all this conversation means to you? Am I going to put out or not?
Don't worry, you already paid me. I'm here because --
It's your job, lady, not mine. I'm here so he can draw my picture.
I'm keeping away. What you are doing is no business of mine.
What're you talking about?
What kind of man are you? Are you a good man?
Yeah, I'm a good man. Something make you think I'm not?
You will not hurt him?
Gimme a break. I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures. Is that going to hurt him?
No. No. I am sorry. Forget everything I say. Here. I will take the tray.
Something I can do for you?
The Master wants to know if you are free for lunch. I tell him you will be having other plans, but he insists I ask.
Got a lawn this afternoon, but I'm free until then.
The Master is dressing. I am to offer you a drink. There is whiskey and there is iced tea.
No. You are a guest now. You go in the living room.
How long you worked for Mr. Whale?
Long enough. Fifteen years.
I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go? Movie stars?
No. We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I. People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim. You have people, Boone?
You mean family? All in Joplin, Missouri.
Your wife?
I'm not married.
Why?
Oh, I don't know. Because no girl in her right mind will have me?
A man who is not married has nothing. He is a man of trouble. You need a woman.
You ever been married, Hanna?
Of course. I am married still.
Yeah? What's your husband do?
He is dead now, twenty years.
Then you're as single as I am.
No. I have children, grandchildren too. I visit when I can. But now that Mr. Jimmy cannot be left very long, I do not get away much. Poor Mr. Jimmy. There is much good in him, but he will suffer the fires of hell. Very sad.
You're sure of that?
This is what the priests tell me. His sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven.
Sins of the flesh? Everybody has those.
What is the good English? All I know is bugger. He is a bugger. Men who bugger each other.
A homo?
That is why he must go to hell. I do not think it fair. But God's law is not for us to judge.
You're telling me Mr. Whale is a homo.
You did not know?
Well...no, not really --
You and he are not doing things?
No!
Good. That is what I hope. I did not think you a bugger too. I fear only that you might hurt him if he tries.
I'm not going to hurt anyone.
It's not what you think.
I have brought you your clothes. All I ask is that you get dressed and go. We are having a guest for breakfast.
I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale.
There is nothing you can say that will surprise me.
Maybe. But I still need to talk. Do I have time for a cup of coffee before I go?
Thanks. Why do you do it?
What do I do?
Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood.
What have you done with him?
I didn't do it. This wasn't me.
Oh, Mr. Jimmy.
He wanted me to kill him, but I didn't. He did it himself.
You must leave. You were not here this morning.
But I didn't do this!
The police will not know that. They will want to investigate.
We have his note.
Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy? Please, Clayton. It will be better if I find the body alone.
But how're you going to explain this? How did you get him out of the pool?
Good morning.
Mornin'.
My name is Whale. This is my house.
Nice place.
And your name is --?
Boone. Clayton Boone.
I couldn't help but notice your tattoo. That phrase? Death Before Dishonor. What does it mean?
Just that I was in the Marines.
Getting to be a warm day. A scorcher, as you Yanks call it.
Everything alright, Mr. Boone?
I was just about to ask Hanna to bring down iced tea. I'd like it very much if you'd join me.
I stink to high heaven right now.
Or would you prefer a beer?
No. Iced tea's fine.
These are your paintings?
What? Oh yes.
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
You know what they say. If you have to ask --
I'm just a hick who cuts lawns. But some of these look familiar.
They were familiar when I painted them. That one's copied from a Dutch still life done almost three hundred years ago. And that's a Rembrandt.
They're just copies then. Gotcha.
But before I retired, you might say I had a brief time in the sun. Fame, as it were. Tell me, do you like motion pictures?
Sure, everybody does. When I was a kid I'd go with my sister twice a week. Why? Were you an actor or something?
In my youth, yes, but never in Hollywood. No, I was merely a director here.
Yeah? What were some of your movies?
This and that. The only ones you maybe have heard of are the "Frankenstein" pictures.
"Frankenstein" and "Bride of" and "Son of" and all the rest?
I made only the first two. The others were done by hacks.
Still. You must be rich. Making a couple of famous movies like those.
When they stay in your employ too long, servants begin to think they're married to you. Please, Mr. Boone. Help yourself.
What did she mean by going flooey?
I returned recently from a stay in hospital.
What was wrong?
You must excuse me for staring, Mr. Boone. But you have a marvelous head.
Huh?
To an artistic eye, you understand. Have you ever modeled?
You mean, like posed for pictures?
Sat for an artist. Been sketched.
What's to sketch?
You have the most architectural skull. And your nose. Very expressive.
Broke is more like it.
But expressively broken. How did it happen?
Football in college.
You went to university?
Just a year. I dropped out to join the Marines.
I apologize for going on like this. It's the Sunday painter in me. Of course I can understand your refusal. It's a great deal to ask of someone.
You mean -- you really want to draw me?
Indeed. I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
But why?
Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him.
And it's just my head you want? Nothing else?
What are you suggesting? You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder.
You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?
All right then. Sure. I could use the extra dough.
Did you see this? They're showing one of your movies tomorrow night.
You don't say? Which picture?
"Bride of Frankenstein."
That shirt, Mr. Boone.
It's new.
I'm sorry. It's too white, too distracting. Would it be asking too much for you to take it off?
I'm not wearing an undershirt.
Pish posh, Mr. Boone. I'm not your Aunt Tilly.
But it's just my face you want to draw.
We could wrap this like a toga around your shoulders. Would that help you overcome your schoolgirl shyness?
Take a picture, it lasts longer.
Would you be more comfortable barefoot? Feel free to remove your boots and socks.
No. I'm fine.
Dripping? Do you ever eat dripping in this country? The fat from roasts and such, congealed in jars. Used like butter on bread.
Sounds like something you feed the dog.
It is. Only the poorest families ever ate it. We kept ours in a crockery jar.
Your family ate dripping?
I'm sorry. I've just realized how terribly ironic it all is.
What?
There's something about the openness of your face that makes me want to speak the truth. Yes, my family ate dripping. Beef dripping and four to a bed, and a privy out back in the alley. Are you also from the slums, Mr. Boone?
We weren't rich. But we weren't poor either.
No, you were middle class, like all Americans.
I guess you'd say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks.
You have to excuse me, Mr. Boone. Since my stroke, I am often overcome with nostalgia.
How are you, Mr. Boone? So glad you are free for lunch.
All right, I guess.
Do you mind?
Is this David's doing?
This David's a friend?
Saw your movie the other night. Watched it with some friends.
Did you now?
I liked it. We all did.
Did anyone laugh?
No.
Pity. People are so earnest nowadays.
Why? Was it supposed to be funny?
Did you kill anyone?
I don't like to talk about that.
It's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. That's something to be proud of.
Proud? Any jerk with a gun can kill someone.
Quite true. Hand-to-hand combat is the true test. Did you ever slay anyone hand-to-hand?
No. I could have, though.
Yes, I believe you could. How free is your schedule this afternoon?
Full up. I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.
What is we say phooey to the hedges? Could you spare an hour after lunch? To sit for me?
Can't today.
I'll pay our going rate. Plus what you'd get if you did the hedges.
Sorry. I don't feel like sitting still today.
Just a trim. And mine while you're at it. Fingers are a bit stiff today.
You ever been married, Mr. Whale?
So you had a wife?
Does that surprise you?
No, I -- you're a homosexual.
Oh dear. If one must have a clinical name.
I'm not, you know.
I never thought you were.
You don't think of me that way, do you?
What way might that be?
You know. Look at me like -- like I look at women.
So we understand each other?
What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say.
I hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today?
Can I see what you did so far?
It will only make you self-conscious. You'll have to remove your shirt.
Sorry. Not today.
But we have to match the other sketch.
Oh dear. I <u>have</u> made you nervous.
I'm fine. I'd just rather keep it on.
I don't mean to be a prick, but that's how I feel.
Tell me more about yourself, Mr. Boone. You have a steady companion?
Not at the moment.
Why not?
You know how it is. You have to kiss ass just to get a piece of it.
Very well put.
The world is just one kiss-ass game after another. A man has to make up his own life, alone.
Ah. A philosopher.
Thoreau with a lawnmower.
Is that why you and your friend split up? Because you wanted to be free?
You might not think it to look at me now, but there was a time when I was at the very pinnacle of my profession. The horror movies were behind me. I'd done "Show Boat." Major success. Great box office. Now I was to do something important. "The Road Back." An indictment of the Great War and what it did to Germany. It was
What happened?
After that, I went out of fashion. I was no longer able to command the best projects, so I walked away. Why should I spend my time working in such a dreadful business?
Do you miss it?
I think we all want to feel we've left our mark on the world. Yes. I wish I had done more work.
You've done a helluva lot more than most people.
But I chose freedom. David was still in the thick of it, his life full of anxiety and studio intrigue. I didn't fancy spending my golden years as merely "the friend." The dirty little secret of a nervous producer.
How long were you...?
Of course, they weren't nearly as bashful. No, this room was once filled with bare buttocks. And pricks. Hard, arrogant pricks --
Isn't it enough you told me you're a fairy? Do you have to rub my nose in it?
I assure you, Mr. Boone, I meant no --
The extras are in their places. Now we need the star. Wouldn't you like to get in the pool?
You first.
Mr. Boone. You're not due to cut the lawn until Wednesday.
I'm curious, Mr. Boone. What convinced you to come back?
I don't know. I guess I like your stories.
Everybody has stories to tell.
Not me.
What about your stint in Korea? I'm sure it was full of dramatic episodes.
And the fear you showed at our last session? How did you overcome that?
Not fear. More like disgust.
Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us. Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion?
There's no people like you in my crowd.
No teammates in football? No comrades in Korea?
You must think the whole world is queer. Well it's not. War sure isn't.
Oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers.
You're talking through your hat now.
Not at all. I was in the foxholes myself.
You were a soldier?
This was World War I?
Barnett. Was that his name? Leonard Barnett. He came to the front straight from Harrow. And he looked up to me. Unlike the others, he didn't care that I was a workingman impersonating his betters. How strange, to be admired so blindly. I suppose he loved me. But chastely, like a schoolboy.
You will not set me on another walk down memory lane. Not this lane. Not today.
I didn't --
Why do I tell you this? I never told David. I never even remembered it until you got me going.
You're the one who started it.
You're very clever, Mr. Boone. You just sit there and let me talk. What a sorry old man, you're thinking. What a crazy old poof. Why are you here? What do you want from me?
You asked me to model. Remember?
Just go. Please. Why don't you go?
I don't get it. First you creep me out with homo shit. Then you hit me with war stories. And now you're upset because I listen? What do you want?
My apologies. I had no business snapping at you.
No harm done.
It was foolishness to attempt this portrait. You cannot force what will not flow.
If you don't mind driving, I'd like to take you as my guest. There should be lots of pretty starlets to keep you amused.
I'm game. Sure.
Very good, Clayton. May I call you Clayton? Or do you prefer Boone?
Good afternoon, Clayton.
I suppose you'd like the top down.
If that's okay?
What did I tell you? Listen.
I don't hear anything.
What was that about?
Who's that?
David. The friend I thought was in New York.
No. The girl.
Is that really her?
Are you enjoying yourself?
Actually, no. I feel a little out of place.
Neither of us really belongs here.
Must have been funny for you. Seeing your monsters again.
Oh fuck. And we left the top down. You want to run for it?
Run for what?
Let's get out of this funk hole
You don't want to wait it out? Rain should let up soon.
I better get you home before you catch your death from pneumonia.
It's not like her.
Just a night out. Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter.
Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?
Oh, of course. Clayton. You finished your shower already?
Ten minutes ago. Didn't you hear me calling?
You're much wider than I am. You won't want to attempt to get into my pants.
That only leaves the rest.
You don't have any baggy shorts? Pajama bottoms?
Sorry. My pajamas are tailored. Would it be too distressing to continue with the towel? No more immodest than a kilt, you know.
Do I have any other choice?
Is that --?
After dinner, if Hanna isn't back? Can we try a few more sketches?
I thought you'd given up on my picture.
I'd like to try again. If you're game.
Tell me something, Clayton. Do you believe in mercy killing?
Never gave it much thought.
I never made it to Korea.
But you said --
-- that I was a Marine. Which is true. You filled in the rest.
My old man was a Marine. He enlisted the day he turned seventeen.
The Great War?
By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over. He missed out.
A very lucky thing indeed.
The morning after Pearl Harbor, he drove down to St. Louis to reenlist. He was so damn excited. World War II was going to be his second chance. They told him he was too old...fat ...nearsighted. Said he'd be more use to his country if he stayed home and looked after his family.
Is that why you joined the Marines? For your father's sake?
I figured he'd think, you know -- it was the next best thing. Hey, I loved it too. A chance to be a part of something important. Something bigger than yourself.
What happened?
You know what he did when I called him? He laughed. He laughed so hard he practically burst a blood vessel. Said it was a good lesson for me. Not to try to fill his shoes.
I'm very sorry.
Them's the breaks, right? No war stories for this pup.
Do you mind?
Storm's getting worse.
"A perfect night for mystery and horror. The air itself is filled with monsters."
That's from your movie, right? "The only monsters are here."
I don't remember that one.
I said it must be weird seeing your monsters again, and you said, "The only monsters are here." I was wondering which here you meant.
I don't recall. Memories of the war, perhaps.
But that was so long ago. It can't still bother you.
Oh, but it does. Especially in light of the journey I'm about to make.
Barnett. Barnett on the wire.
Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling? Grave where thy victory?
You survived it. It can't hurt you now. It's no good to dig it up.
So it is going to happen after all.
No. It won't do.
What won't do?
You are much too human.
What did you expect? Bronze?
Why?
For the artistic effect. The combination of your human body and that inhuman mask. It's quite striking.
I don't know.
Please, Clayton. Just for a minute. Long enough for me to see the effect.
It's from the first World War, isn't it?
All right. Let's take it off now.
What was that?
Just take off the fucking mask!
I'm not that way. Get it through your fucking head. I don't want to mess with you.
Wait until I tell my friends I had you naked in my arms. Won't they be surprised?
I haven't done a damn thing with you!
Break my neck. Or strangle me. It would be oh so easy to wrap your hands around my neck and choke the life out of me. Please, Clayton. We've come this far.
Look, if you want to die do it yourself!
You okay?
Oh Clayton.
Did I hurt you?
Nothing I didn't deserve.
Need some help?
I can undress myself, thank you.
When you die...be sure your brain is the last organ to fizzle --
You'll feel better tomorrow.
Boone! You awake? Eight o'clock.
Fuck off!
I'm up. Thanks.
I liked it. You learn stuff listening to old-timers.
This kisser wasn't so bad you couldn't lay under it a few times.
You coming, Boone?
Hey, Boone.
Can't say that I have. Can't say I've heard of a lot of people though.
If you don't believe me, let's watch this movie. See if his name's on it. How about it, Harry? Can I watch my damn movie?
Calm down, Clay. Just calm down. We'll watch it.
You're like a dog with a bone over this movie, Clay.
Sick stuff. Necrophilia. I wonder if they knew how sick they were.
Go home, Clay. We're closing up.
Where's Betty?
She tells me you haven't been sleeping well.
It's the ridiculous pills they prescribe. If I take them, I spend the next day stupid as a stone. If I don't, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once --
Then take the pills.
I'm sorry, Jimmy. But with this movie and two difficult stars --
"The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars."
You remember how a production eats up one's life.
By the way, I like the Renoir.
Thank you.
What are you doing here?
Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York.
Should you be drinking in your condition?
You should have seen Georgie's face when he met Clayton.
You didn't, Jimmy.
I did. But Princess Margaret was a doll. We're all equals in her eyes. As commoners, I presume.
You only embarrass yourself.
Oh dear. I'll never work in this town again?
You know what I mean. Your reputation.
But I have no reputation. I'm as free as the air.
Well the rest of us aren't. Can't you remember that?
I didn't ask George to invite you.
Then who did?
Jimmy, there are people here I need to speak to. You'll be fine on your own?
Yes. Perfectly.
You're a lucky man, Mr. Whale. Whatever damage was done by your stroke, it left your motor abilities relatively unimpaired.
Yes, yes, Dr. Payne. But from the neck up? What's my story there?
The central nervous system selects items from a constant storm of sensations. Whatever was killed in your stroke appears to have short-circuited this mechanism. Parts of your brain now seem to be firing at random.
You're saying there's an electrical storm in my head?
That's as good a way as any to describe it. I've seen far worse cases. You might even learn to enjoy these walks down memory lane.
But the rest of it? The killing headaches. The phantom smells. My inability to close my eyes without thinking a hundred things at once. It's all nothing more than bad electricity?
In a manner of speaking. I've never encountered the olfactory hallucinations, but I'm sure they're related.
So what do I do?
Take the Luminal to sleep, or whenever you feel an attack coming on.
My God. Is the audience to presume that Colin and I have done her hair? I thought we were mad scientists, not hairdressers.
Only a mad scientist could do this to a woman.
Oh no, my dear. You look absolutely amazing. There's no way I can compete with you. The scene is yours.
In the sequel, James, two lady scientists should make a monster. And our monster would be Gary Cooper.
I would've thought Mr. Leslie Howard would be more your line.
More your line.
Uh-oh. The way you look at me, James. What have you done this time?
Bring a mirror. Let the Bride feast upon her visage.
And you said there'd be some of me left. Nobody's going to know me in this getup.
Jimmy. How are you?
I saw Una O'Conner a few weeks ago. She said you'd been under the weather.
Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Growing old.
We're all getting a bit long in the tooth.
Please. You shouldn't stand on my account.
Perfectly all right. But if you'd like to sit --
I'm fine, Jimmy. I can only stay a few minutes.
Of course.
Is that Boris? Our little chum appears to be arranging a reunion.
We'll be in touch, Jimmy.
Hanna? Who's the new yardman?
There is iced tea, Hanna? Cucumber sandwiches?
Yes, Mr. Jimmy. An interview. After so many years. Very exciting.
Mr. Kay, sir.
Which ones? I bring them all.
You must think I'm terrible, Hanna.
I do not think you anything anymore. Just back from the hospital and already you are chasing after boys.
Oh shut up. All we did was talk. My attack had nothing to do with him.
Perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold.
How are you feeling, Mr. Jimmy? How is your mind today?
You remember what the doctor tells us.
Yes, yes, yes. I merely invited Mr. Boone in for a glass of tea. We'll have a brief chat and he'll finish the yard.
I am not forgetting your last brief chat.
He looks plenty big. You won't need my help if anything goes flooey.
Oh, that monster. How could you be working with him?
He is not going to kill the old man?
She is horrible.
You will take them all, Mr. Jimmy?
I'll be fine, Hanna. Thank you.
Does the yardman come today?
Who was that at the door?
Mr. Boone. He is an interesting friend.
I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.
Do you miss having someone to talk to, Hanna?
I have my family. Also our Lord Jesus Christ.
It needs a hat. There was a wide-brimmed cream fedora...
That is my daughter. She say she and her husband are coming to town this afternoon. I am sorry, Mr. Jimmy. I will make it short.
I'll be out this afternoon, remember? Your family can visit as long as they like.
Mr. Whale, this is such an honor. You're one of my favorite all-time directors. I can't believe I'm meeting you.
No. I expect you can't.
And this is your house. Wow. The house of Frankenstein. I thought you'd live in a spooky old mansion or villa.
One likes to live simply.
That's my favorite line in my favorite movie of yours. "Bride of Frankenstein."
Will that be good for you, Mr. Kay?
Sure.
This is the studio where I paint.
So, Mr. Kay? What do you want to know?
Everything. Start at the beginning.
Yes?
Your father was a schoolmaster?
There was one play in particular, a beautiful, grim study of war called "Journey's End". Every experienced director turned it down, so I offered myself, bullying and begging for the job. "Journey's End" made the careers of everyone associated with it. It was only a matter of time until Hollywood beckoned.
How much longer before we get to "Frankenstein"?
Am I correct in assuming, Mr. Kay, that it's not me you're interested in, only my horror pictures?
Oh no, I want to hear everything. You made twenty pictures in all --
Twenty-one. The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking. The horror pictures were trifles. Grand guignol for the masses.
I am not dead yet, Mr. Kay.
I have a proposal, Mr. Kay. This mode of questioning is getting old, don't you think?
I don't mind.
That's funny, Mr. Whale.
It is, isn't it? My life as a game of strip poker. Shall we play?
You're serious.
Quite.
Then the rumors are true?
What rumors might those be?
That you were forced to retire because, uh -- a sex scandal.
Too warm for a sweater, anyway.
George Cukor? Who made "A Star Is Born"? I never guessed.
Don't be shy. There's time to stop before you go too far.
Can we talk about the horror movies now?
Certainly, Mr. Kay. Is there anything in particular you want to know?
Can that count as one question?
Of course.
Just like going swimming, isn't it?
Maybe you'd like a swim when we're through. I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.
Okay. "Frankenstein." Tell me everything.
Universal wanted me for another story, and wanted me so baldly -- I mean badly, not baldly. I was given the pick of stories being developed, and I picked that one.
Who came up with the Monster's makeup and look?
My idea. Muchly. My sketches. Big heavy brow. Head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new, like tinned beef.
He's one of the great images of the twentieth century. As important as the Mona Lisa.
Mr. Whale? Are you all right?
Oh my God. What's wrong, Mr. Whale? Is it your heart?
I was going to take a swim.
I'm sorry I spoiled it for you. You should probably go home.
Mr....Kay?
Bet you thought you'd never see me again. I didn't know if you'd be well enough to come to this party.
You didn't?
I'm the one who got you on Mr. Cukor's guest list.
You, Mr. Kay? How do you know George Cukor?
I interviewed him after I met you. I'm his social secretary now. Well, assistant to his secretary.
I commend you. If you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you. You waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs.
Don't think that, Mr. Whale. I love your movies. That's why I wanted you to come to this. So I could see you with your monsters.
My monsters?
How are you?
Fine. Quite fine. And Your Royal Highness?
Can we get together while I'm in town? I so badly want to sit for you again.
Sit?
Oh dear. Have I made a blunder?
Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine. James Whale.
How's the leg?
What are you doing here?
What about?
It's been a long time, Memphis --
Six years ...
Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it? Six years ago we were fartin' through Armani and pissin' Cristal. Now look at us ...
He took a job. And he fumbled it. Now he's jammed-up. Jammed-up bad...
What kind of job... ?
A boost. A big boost ...
It seems she neglected to mention it
Maybe she don't know. Although I don't see how that could be. Maybe she didn't want to upset you -
Don't feel the need to explore my family dynamics, Atley...
Who was the job for?
Car-jacker. Neglected to clean up after himself ...
Jesus ...
What's with the fish thing -- ?
We can learn something from our Asian friends. They smoke a thousand cigarettes a day; they're completely stressed and overworked; they drink like, well ...
Fish.
And they still have the lowest rate of cancer of anywhere in the world. You know why? All they eat is seafood.
Also, never underestimate the restorative powers of "Karaoke."
I do a poaching number. Six-ounce fillets in a saucepan of brine. In 8 minutes, I could cater a goddamn wedding. Plain but flavorful. And it's a good way to show off my Hollandaise sauce ...
You have a Hollandaise sauce ?
I do ... Christ, what happened to us ?
Speak for yourself, boss I don't have a Hollandaise sauce
I think about that night a lot...
Me, too. Every time I walk...
Yeah -- ?
Jesus, man ... What'd you do?
My version of "take this job and shove it..."
Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead, right?
Randall Raines ... It's been a long time ... frowns) 'though I do I recall you as a man with style. You remember your old friend, Atley -- ?
It's about my brother ... Kip...
Now. Where were we? Oh, yes. Kip.
My point. Yes. Simple, really. I require the best. I insist on the best. I only engage the best. Your brother. His friends. They came to me. They wanted my paper. He was your brother. You were the best. Now. They've brought so much goddamn heat down, I may not be able to fill this order. Which would be very bad for me. Which
I could kill you. That occurred to me. When I first heard about this. That I would kill you ...
I can come up with the front money. Pay you back...
They gave you only four days?
I'm not interested --
I knew you'd say that.
I'm just here about my brother.
Sound it out for me.
Your brother has four days. Fifty cars. Five-zero. For that he gets 200 large ...
I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em...
This is how you're spending my time? Having a sock hop?
Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the community ...
Get out of here, Ray --
One more night --
Get out --
Well, well. You've caused quite a ruckus ...
This is number 50. We did it. It's over Where's the money ?
You should never have gotten my brother and his friends involved ...
Well, now, he's clear. And you'll stay away from him...
Well, that certainly won't do.
What do you mean -- ?
Look at it. I can't very well make delivery of that thing ...
You got no choice. It's over.
Good. Cos you know how it plays. Six years ago, I let you go free. But the next time ... The next time sends you away for'a long, long while ...
They just brought in Donny Astricky. Shot by a jacker ...
How is he?
Let's get out there. And have them run down every 167 Shelby Mustang in the area ... Find out where they're at.
What for?
I know you --
You know my back -
You want to come along quiet?
How's Atley -- ?
Leg's all banged-up. He made a stupid play ... He'll limp around the yard up at Folsom. But Astricky will be there to take care of him. With their priors, they're looking at a serious bounce --
Let them go --
How's that?
Let them go. And I'll leave ...
You'll leave -- ?
You don't have anything on me. A misdee auto-theft. I got no record. I'll be out in three days, and back at it. Or you let them go, and I give you my word. I'm gone. And without the ringleader ... Your tee-times have just grown exponentially...
You have my word...
I know you.
I remember us having made some kind of deal, Randall. I don't remember this deal having some kind of time-limit. I look at you - here - in my town - and I'm confused...
A little family emergency --
I hope it's not your dear sweet mother...
No...
Or your baby brother. What was his name?
Kip.
And this has what to do with me?
I know you.
You know my back.
What are you still doing here, Randall?
You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ?
It's funny. There's probably been five more cars stolen in the time I've been here ...
I'm on the move -
Your girl works in there ...
Not my girl anymore
Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...
What do you want from me?
I know you.
I want you gone, Randall. Settle your affairs. Make it right with those you love. Hell, take 'em with you. But I want you out of here. Out of here for good this time ...
Consider me gone, Detective --
I'll catch you later, Randall --
Double-meaning intended --
Who is it -- ?
What's this -- ?
What's wrong with it -- ?
No faith in our new-found goodness, Detective ...?
Okay, then. I'll catch you later, Randall ...
Double-meaning intended, right?
When'd you get to town, Raines?
The other day....
What for?
No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I heard we got Shaquille ...
Where you been, anyway?
Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...
You seem a little hinked-up ...
How'd it go?
Keys were in it ...
It just ain't happening --
You'll get the hang of it, kid. You just need to remember one thing -
I guess ...
You got a school teacher or Nancy from accounting, you don't put on Sly Stone or James Brown. You put on Ravel. Rachmaninoff. But if you got some wild one you just picked up at the track, you wouldn't put on Cat Stevens or James Taylor. You'd put on Prince. Or Isaac Hayes. Or, if you really wanted to get after it: Miles.
okay ...
It's the same way with cars. Different cars. Different tunes. You can't steal a Maserati listening to Sinatra. You gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV, on that shit. But never, never-ever take no Allman Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car. Could lead to disaster. Got it... ?
Got it ...
Diane 1.
Very good. Think you can get in without waking her up -- ?
Yeah.
What's the matter?
It's all microchips and shit ...
So? Tell me: how come they call you "Freb" anyways -- ?
C'mon, man ...
You ever feel bad about any of this?
Of course not. I'm Robin Hood. I take from the rich, and give to the needy...
You mean the poor --
Donny --
C'mon, Donny... Let's go, man --
Lookit Kip. All grown up...
You guys have any skills at all?
What about him?
For real. Okay. Gimme COLUMBO...
Peugot convertible ...
What color?
No. That was Higgins ....
Damn. Memphis Raines. Long time ...
How you doing, man?
All I get are the Orientals. They can build 'em, but they can't drive 'em So? What are you doing here? What's with the outfit -- ?
Forget that ...
Most of 'em are late-model...
That's right. Only 10 exotics ...
Wow! They got Eleanor here -- ?
Eleanor is Memphis' "unicorn."
How's it going -- ?
I miss Orville Redenbacher already --
A bunch of strung-out hypes and stick- up men. This ain't like the old days, Memphis. The profession has lost its..
Dignity...
We're on a truncated time-table. Take a day to shop it; a day to prep it ... And we're still going to need to expand the crew...
There's no one left ...
Jesus. The whole damn thing's loaded.
Yes, I do, in fact. John Wayne in McO...
Walked like a bastard... Skippin' stones and shit..
That's a good one, Donny...
The corner of Hawthorne and Granvia. Tumbler messed up. He said the Lotus would be at the corner of Hawthorne and Granvia --
How are we supposed to--
Any word, Kip -- ?
No ... And they won't take my calls ...
What does that mean -- ?
That can't be it. Cos we don't need saving
How you know that?
Okay, okay. What about MAGNUM P.I.?
You look good...
You, too, Ma...
What are you doing back?
Have you seen him?
No.
oh.
Atley Jackson came to see me ...
Why didn't you tell me?
I couldn't. I didn't want you to worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?
He's in some trouble ...
I knew it. He's changed, Randall. He's a different boy. He's lost that... That sweetness ... It's gone ... And I don't know what to do ...
You getting my checks ... ?
He doesn't return my calls. or my letters ...
The photo album. I get nostalgic around this time of year ...
What time of year?
You ever wonder what things'd be like if he hadn't died?
Every day. I wonder about that every day...
And just in case you lose your keys, good sir, I can toss in a complimentary slim-jim, free of charge ...
I remember. Supper getting cold, cos you two are out there heads under hoods ...
I know...
D.W.P. Thanks for holding. How can I help you?
I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.
Yes. can you hold, sir -- ?
okay, sir. Let me just get the-order. Yes. We'll be doing some work out your way. We've got a power leak. And it's unsafe. We're moving residences to the... Marriott Long Beach ... Just for the night ...
Oh, for God's sake
Breakfast brunch -- ?
Okay, then ... I just go to the Marriott and I'm set ...
Any more, O -- ?
You guys are through...
Whatcha got left ... ?
"Carol." A 198 Mercedes ... She lives in the suburbs ...
We'll take it...
It's ear-marked for Mirror Man and The Sphinx...
Hey, Kip, what's up?
What do you say, Toby?,
You goin' home?
Yeah... You want a ride...
Sure -
How'd you get here? Your Moms give you ride -- ?
Hell, no. I boosted a 'Vette.
You boosted a 'Vette? Then where is it?
I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta' boosted it back...
It looks just like a regular Mustang --
Any more ...
No...
Jesus, Kip ... I'm shot, man ...
Hey, Kip ...
It's good to see ya, man. You changed your look -
Kip -- ?
Yeah ...
You all right -- ?
I think so. There's things I can't feel right now. Like my feet. But ... You think you can get me outta this, Memphis? I'd appreciate it -
This has nothing to do with any of that --
Oh. You maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?
All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...
You okay -- ?
Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer, man -- ?
You sure you're okay -- ?
Cool. So you're living up North?
Yeah -
I heard you were pumping gas -
Something like that -
You're kind of cultivating a new look.
Nah. It's a scratch.
Hey, you want something to eat ?
There's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive -
So what are you gonna do?
About what?
"About what?"
About Calitri? No worries, man. I'll call him. He's a reasonable dude ...
What happened to you?
You just got crushed in a car. You're bleeding all over your self. And you sit there - eating olives and talking basketball, as if, at this very moment, people weren't plotting your demise ...
C'mon, man... My "demise..." Overreaction
"Over--" You know - I can maybe understand, since I been gone, you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime, and for that I can partly blame myself. But what is baffling to me, is how, since I been gone, you've become a complete and total moron--
Hey, now -
He's gonna kill you -- !
I can handle it --
You can handle it?
I can handle it --
You can handle it?
I can handle it --
You?
Me.
You?
You don't think so, huh?
What are you doing here?
We do this. Then. You're finished. Then. You're clean
I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...
You hear me?
You spread it out ... you move around... So's they can't touch you... so's they don't know... Shadow games and shit ...
"Shadow games?"
Shadow games ...
Reads the infrared. Then kills it. Little something the R & D department came up with ...
How long were you gonna let me try and stop it...?
After a while, it became a little pathetic ... Figured I'd put you out of your misery ...
Thank-you ...
Ain't we good-timing here ... ?
The family that steals together, deals together...
Dad'd be proud --
Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...
What era was that -- ?
The era when crime didn't pay --
As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?
Price of doing business...
What about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five days a week, that whole mystery achievement -- ?
Having fun, Kip?
You okay -- ?
Too early to tell. Nervous?
Nah.
That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous. Everyone's nervous. But not you...
I dunno. Whatever will be will be...
What did I tell you? What? What did I tell you?
Come here --
What?
Come here -
What?
I've missed you, man ...
Toby...
I know ...
What are you doing here?
I saw her get smashed-up on the TV. Knew there was no way he was gonna accept her ...
Where'd you find this one?
Ya gotta keep tabs on your "Eleanors", Memphis. Cos you never know when you're gonna need one --
You boost her -- ?
Hell, yeah. She's not my unicorn.
You okay -- ?
You remember where you got this Eleanor -- ?
Sure, man --
You want me to buy her?
Where you off to -- ?
Thirteen down ... Thirty-seven to go ...
But don't worry, man. Things are all sweetness and light here...
Pop the trunk, Tumbler.
What for -- ?
Now what -- ?
Shit ...
What are we gonna do -- ?
Hospital.
He give you an advance -- ?
You know of one -- ?
Take it back, Freb --
Okay. We're all here. Today's Wednesday. D-Day is Friday night ... That gives us two days to prep ... We're going to find the ladies on our list, find out where they live, when they're home; that they're properly insured ... Let's get into the vans --
Where we going -- ?
Jim Rockford. ROCKFORD FILES.
How's it going?
Call 911 -
Call 'em here -- ?
See you're still stealing the sailors from the sea --
What's with the look?
The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting old...
You still wrenching at Bacchiochi's?
Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ...
Buy you a drink?
"Mitch?"
Mitch.
So I was replaced by Mitch?
On account of Mitch?
I've taken the spear for a lot of people, Sway. Including you. Can't we improvise a little here ... ?
No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember?
I left town. I didn't leave you.
A distinction worth noting ...
And here I am...
Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -
What kind of trouble -- ?
Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared.
And you got some Italians -- ?
Six or seven...
I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...
What the hell are you doing -- ?
That's Mirror Man ... And that's Freb ... And Tumbler ... And Toby ... Fellas, this is Sara Wayland... They call her "Sway."
Hey.
What's wrong with her -- ?
Right. Great car. One of a kind. I was looking forward to that boost myself
She was the only "Annie" you could find?
They only made a handful. We're lucky there's even one living in the area...
She's trouble --
I go with you --
That what you want?
That's what I want ...
You mentioned that in your letters
We were good when you bailed, weren't we?
Very good...
Cos there were those dark days, when I figured - my God, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew ... And give me up in the process.
No way ...
No ... ?
Don't go getting all warm and fuzzy on me, Randall. I'm the jane that was left, and you're the jim that did the leaving. So save the sanctimonious shit for someone who believes. The only reason I ride with you, is cause I don't want to spend the whole night with any of them other creeps!
Ready -- ?
No whistles, but a Club You bring a hack -- ?
What the hell's that -- ?
Gosh, no. Lipstick? What next? Mascara, blush, floral-print dresses?
So, you seeing anybody?
No. I had a girl. She was great. The problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. So I gotta wait another three years before I can even bother to look...
She was so great, why'd you leave her?
C'mon, gang. Let's focus. Sway, can you prep 'em -- ?
I think so... They're just... So ...
Arright ... Enough ... I can't have you bellying up to my heart again, man, f you can't help falling off the stool. But he puts his mouth to her ears ...
Stop. What about Maserati Boy?
I take out my slim-jim...
Slip it in ...
You're going high-cheese, dude --
Unlock your button ...
"Unlock my button" ... ?
The alarms go off ...
Woo-woo-wooooo!
I pop your hood; find your siren wires
They're factory alarms ... Easy to get around... For a man with... Skills...
I do ... I cut "em...
Cut 'em...
Now... I'm in ...
Of course you are. You're a professional...
I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...
I bet you say that to all the girls...
With a twist of my wrist ... You're turned over ...
Wrong preposition...
Hear you roar ...
What about The Club ... ?
Let me worry about The Club ...
No worries ...
You're still quite the boost, Randall Raines ... Except now I've been chopped, and my parts are in a Honda Prelude being driven to church in South America by some Bolivian consulate's wife ...
Donny got shot ... A jacker ...
How is he -- ?
Where to -- ?
You okay -- ?
What are you doing... ?
I can't. I got a back load of repairs and one of the mechanics called in sick and I haven't slept and-- Where to -- ?
This time it's for real?
What -- ?
Nothing. Just that if I was less secure, I might think you were more into Eleanor than you are me...
She does have one thing you don't.
What's that?
Am I dying? Are all the angels of my life returning to bid a final farewell? And have my angels completely lost their fashion sense -- ?
Hello, Otto ...
You remember Junie?
Whatever do you mean?
The chop-shop... Where are the stripped cars? The rolled-back odometers? The part bins?
I heard rumors you were back. About Kip ...
You think it can be done?
Are you considering a comeback tour?
Tell me...
It can be done. Take two days to shop; one to prep. I'll offer up my bible for a small fee. You also have to hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo Castlebeck's linkage so much so that he's setting up surveillance teams on every city block. And then get yourself a crew...
The hard part ...
"A people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then to get around them..." Nietzsche said that.
Is he still working here ?
The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
I remember I had a 1964 Buick Opal. worst car ever built. Value job. Everything broke and I-fixed it. A coma car - built to German specs. Plastic gas line. 3 speedometer head. On a quiet night, you could hear it rusting in the garage. But when that car was gone, I missed it. If it came driving back in here right now, there'd
And the moral of that story is -- ?
Some crew you got ...
You need him...
No we don't -
I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis. But how are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days...
His criminal career has officially come to a close ...
Okay, then... Otto?
Anyone? The significance of "Robin 1" on Magnum's license plate? Memphis?
Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the estate they lived on ...
Split it up. Any word on Donny?
He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.
What happened to Sway?
Dinosaurs. All of us. The Ice Age is now...
Hey, Memphis. Remember me? Toby Walker. I live next door ...
Sure. Hey, Toby. You grew up
How old are you now, Toby?
This Eleanor's been living at the International Towers for 3 years now.
Who's "Eleanor?"
The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.
Why do you call it "Eleanor?"
She's not. Carroll Shelby tweaked the Mustang's High-Performance 289 engine and got it legally rated for the street at 450 horsepower ... But its actual output is closer to 600 ...
So she flies -
I logged outside the G.R.A.B. site, right? Then I monitored their incoming outside data requests, right? Then I got these ISDN numbers, right? Then I tracked them back, right? Then I took the one I could jack-up the easiest, right? Then I called back see, they think I'm an insurance company - that's where it looks like I'm coming from -- and they're sharing
So what's in there -- ?
What about me?
You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto abreast of our progress ...
How come ... ?
Because you should be home with Nintendo, listening to The Spice Girls, little man ...
Okay. All our ladies should be home now, tucked in bed. Let's keep chilly. Think Slow. Any questions?
You're gonna be okay, Toby... You are ... We'll getcha fixed up...
You know what you got here?
Not really -
There's excessive resistance in the cranking circuit ... You know what you gotta do -- ?
Not really --
You have any other answers besides "not really"?
Not --
Uh ... Randall -- ?
What do you want, shithead?
Why you gotta front me like that? I'm talking to Kip --
Why don't you leave him alone?
I known Kip longing than you, man ...
What are you doing here, assface?
Which way's out, man -- ?
You think I don't know? You think I like to keep this inside? But I gotta, or he'll kill the miserable bastard and he'll be there for life. It's disgusting what you have to put up with.
Look at Jeannie's kid.
What? What happened?
The oldest one. He was in an argument. A lousy ten-dollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he's been arrested. She has a heart attack. She drops dead right on the spot. Now Jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
But he was always a bad kid, that one.
Hey, look at him. Tommy. You grew up.
Billy, how are you?
Hey, Billy. Watch the suit.
Listen to him. "Watch the suit," he says. A little pisser I've known all my life. Hey, Tommy, don't go get too big.
Don't go busting my balls. Okay?
You remember Tommy's shines? The kid was great. He made mirrors.
No more shines, Billy.
Tell him. It's okay.
What did you hear about that thing?
What thing? The Brooklyn thing?
No. No. The guy from downtown.
The guy from near where Christie used to live?
No. The other one. The one who disappeared up the block from Christie. The one they made a beef on.
I don't want any more of that Shit.
Wha? Me?
Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.
Me? Why would I get into that shit?
I know what you did inside. You did what you had to do. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking from now on, outside. I'm talking right here.
I'm not going to get fucked like Gribbs. He's seventy years old and the fucking guy is going to die in prison. I don't need that. I don't care who it is. I'm warning everybody. Gribbs got twenty years just because he said hello to some fuck who was sneaking around selling junk behind his back. That's not going to happen to me. You
Paulie. Why would I? I swear.
You're only home early because we got you a job, right? And I don't need any heat. You understand?
Nods.
And, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me.
Nods again.
Anybody! You understand?
I warned you a million times.
I've been all fucked up since I got out.
You think I didn't know what you were doing?
It was easy money. I did it in the can. Shit! I learned the junk business in the can, Paulie.
Right in my face. You looked in my face and you lied.
But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe me. I was fucking crazy. But I'm okay now. I can be trusted. I'm clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together...
You thought I was some fucking jerk?
Paulie. You're all I got. I need help.
Here. Take it. Now I gotta turn my back on you.
I had a meeting with Tuddy around eleven o'clock and here I am a back-up guy.
Have more coffee. It'll wake you up.
I didn't know, I swear. I thought it was next week.
Take it easy. We can talk about it.
She's screaming on the street and I mean loud, but she looked good. She had these violet eyes. I remember she's screaming, but mostly I'm looking at her eyes. They were just like Elizabeth Taylor's. That's what everybody said.
Talk? To you? After what you did!
What're you doing? What about the car?
What do you do?
I'm in construction.
Go inside. I'll be right there.
What are you gonna do?
My bag. My bag.
What bag?
The bag with the envelopes.
I Don't know. I don't know if I could live that way. What if, God forbid, you go to prison. Mickey said Jeannie's husband --
I'm gonna need some money.
I don't care. Something's going on.
Henry. Wake up.
It's all bullshit. I swear. It's nothing. Whatever you want, we'll do.
The truth was, that no matter how bad I felt, I was still very attracted to him. Why should I give him up to someone else? Why should she win?
I thought you were supposed to turn yourself in at ten o'clock this morning?
I'm just having my last few drinks.
I've been all over town. I got a call from the bondman. He says they're going to rescind your bail if you don't show up and sign in right now. They're going to take away the house.
You son of a bitch. She's been here.
What are you talking about?
Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.
Jezuz Christ!
You want her to visit you? Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
Stop! Stop!
Nobody's helping me. Tommy got four years. Marty and Fran are broke. I asked your friend Remo for the money he owed you, and you know what he told me?
It'll be okay.
We've got to help each other.
Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.
It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody. Forget Paulie. As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
I can't do it anymore.
Yes, you can. I've got it set up. We'll be fine. All I need is for you to keep bringing the stuff. I've got a guy in here from Pittsburgh who'll move it for me. Believe me, in a month we'll be fine. We won't need anybody.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid if Paulie finds out.
Don't worry about Paulie. Is he helping you? Is he putting food on the table? We've got to help ourselves. We just have to be careful while we do it.
I don't want to hear about her anymore.
Get packed. We're getting out of here.
With what?
Don't worry with what. You just start looking for a new place. I'm going to Pittsburgh in the morning. The guys from Pittsburgh they owe me fifteen grand from our little partnership and it's only the beginning.
But you've got to see your parole officer in the afternoon and I promised we'd take Judy to F.A.O. Schwarz.
I had everybody working. Even our old babysitter.
She's beautiful. Look at her. Henry, look at her.
Jimmy's calling every day. It's urgent.
What did he say, exactly?
At least Jimmy and Mickey want to help. I talk to Mickey every day. That's more than I can say for the rest.
I told Jimmy the cops took our cars and froze our bank accounts and he offered to get me some money. Be wants to know what's happening. You gotta meet him.
Then you're safer in here.
Safe? Here? They'll kill me here. They're all afraid I'm gonna rat them out. People are already looking to walk away from me. I'm dead in here. You gotta get me out.
Who's gonna do that?
So now my plan was to stay alive long enough to sell off the dope that the cops never found and disappear for a while until I got things straightened out.
Where's the stuff?
What are you talking about?
You know. The stuff I left.
I flushed it down the toilet.
You what?
What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house.
Are you fucking nuts? That was forty, fifty thousand. I need it. I was depending on that money.
They had a warrant. They went through everything. They would have found it. I swear.
Shit You know they would have never found it. Why did you do it? Why did you do it? My God, why did you have to do it?
What happened? You okay?
I got seared.
Okay. Don't worry about it. It's okay.
What about the schools?
What are we going to do with him? We can't dump him in the street.
Keep 'em coming.
You got money for your bullshit television, don't you? I gotta watch you swimming back and forth on TV all night long, don't I? You got money for that, but you don't have my money?
We got a problem, that thing we took care of upstate?
Paulie was just talking about him.
Well, we gotta dig him up again.
What?
The guy just sold the property. They're gonna build condominiums and I don't want anybody digging up the little bastard.
It's been six months.
It's still better than letting somebody find him.
If Paulie finds out, we got problems.
we're gonna feed the bastard to the lions.
What lions? I'm not going near any lions.
For Christmas. Your share. It's just a taste.
Jimmy.
Give'm a drink.
I gotta talk to you.
Oh yeah? Anything you say.
What's going on? What happened to Stacks? Is everything okay?
Don't worry about it.
There are cops all over the place.
Paulie's gonna make him?
What'll I tell Fran?
Watch this.
Come on, don't fuck around, will ya?
I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.
You want the melon?
Nah.
I better call again.
What fucking good are these things? They don't fit. What do I need this for? I'm not paying for this shit.
I can't eat, just get me some coffee.
He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing. In the old days, Jimmy would have ordered doubles and eaten it all. On the surface, of course, everything was supposed to be fine. We were supposed to be discussing my case, just like we always would, but I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense whether I was going to rat him out to
I think you got a good shot at beating the case.
How?
It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.
Yeah.
He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida.
Yeah.
I didn't agree to three points over the vig.- What am I nuts? I didn't need it that much.
It's a fait accompli?
Done.
And Jimmy's in it, right?
I want to talk to Jimmy.
He heard.
But I got two hundred and fifty coming. It's my share. Jimmy owes me.
What happened to you?
I can't make any more deliveries.
Whadda you mean, you can't make any more deliveries? You're going to fuck up everything?
It was the first time I had ever seen anyone shot.
I You wasted eight fucking aprons on that guy. :
Where'd you find such creeps?
You ready?
Yeah.
You know what to do?
Yeah, yeah.
Now this is important. Make sure you leave the house when you make the call. You understand? Do you hear me? It's important. Call from an outside phone. I mean it.
Jesus! You must think I'm dumb. What are you bugging me for? I know what to do!
I gotta go home.
What for? I got a pound of stuff in my jacket I've been carrying around all day. We gotta start taping it to your leg.
Do you realize what we're involved in here now?
I don't care. I need my hat. I won't go without it.
Come on, relax. He's drunk. He's been locked up for six years.
I don't give a shit. That guy's got no right.
Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it.
He's insulting me. Rat bastard. He's never been any fuckin' good.
Tommy. Come on. Relax.
Batts's made. His whole crew is going to be looking for him. This is fucking bad.
You gotta help me. Okay? This girl I told you about? Diana? She's from the Five Towns. She's Jewish. She won't go out with me alone. Can you believe this shit? She's fucking prejudiced, but she's built. She's never been out with an Italian before. She says she'll only go out on a double date with her girlfriend. You believe this shit? But you
Will you get the fuck out of here.
Is it my fault she won't go out without her girlfriend? For Chrissake. Come on. You don't even have to stay. Jeesuz! What's the big deal?
Tommy, don't fuck around. Put the gun away. Tommy!
No, no. It's okay.
Tommy, come on. Put the gun away.
Stay there.
Don't start. I told you to clean up. Look at this place. It's a pigpen. Look around here. Why do you think I bought you the dishwasher? Look. Look at this. There's enough powder around here to put us all away.
I hate to do dishes.
Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody.
Are you okay? What happened?
I don't need this... You said tonight and now it's not tonight...
It's okay. I'll make it up. I promise. Just hurry it up a little. Okay?
How is he? Okay? Are they busting his chops?
He's okay. They sobered him up.
Did he say what they're asking him about?
Jimmy. I don't know. I got so much else on my mind. I got the kids. We got no money.
I gotta talk to him as soon as I can.
He says he's too hot. He doesn't even know I came here today. It's like he's crazy. Jimmy.
The third store down.
He didn't call?
He's with his friends.
What kind of person doesn't call?
He's a grown man. Be doesn't have to call every five minutes.
If he was so grown up he'd get you two an apartment.
Don't bring that up. You're the one who wanted us here.
He's got your father upset. Good thing he doesn't have to go to work in the morning. Is this what he deserves?
Ma! Please! You're driving me crazy.
Driving you crazy? Don't get me started. You're here a month and sometimes I know he doesn't come home at all. What kind of people are these?
Ma! Stop! What do you want me to do?
Do? What can you do? What did you expect? He wasn't Jewish. Did you know bow they live? Your father would never stay out this late without calling. In thirty years he never stayed out all night.
We'll pack up everything and send it to you.
I got dry cleaning.
Don't worry about the schools. We'll take care of the schools.
I don't want them left back.
They won't be left back. They'll stay in their grade.
If you knew those fucking kids. They're nuts. Especially that Tommy. What am I going to do with them?
But I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds of things. Paulie. You know me all my life. I've always done the right thing.
You think that matters? You think they give a shit about anything? The little bastards.
But it isn't right, Paulie. That Tommy, he's making trouble for me all over town. I can't go here. I can't go there.
You? You think you're the only one? I've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen.
But, Paulie, please.
Someday they'll get what's coming to them. That's the only way they'll stop.
Paulie, I swear, I'm afraid. The guy's nuts. What do I have to do? Whatever I gotta do, I'll do.
You want a partner?
You guys know my cousin Mikey Sullivan?
Yeah.
Well you know how he loves animals right? Anyway, last week he's drivin' home...
What? Come on!
Two weeks? That's nothin'. My Uncle Marty? Will knows him. That guy fuckin' drinks like you've never seen! One night he was drivin' back to his house on I-93-- Statie pulls him over.
Oh shit.
No way! You're kiddin'!
Who's she talking to?
--Yah, restructurin' the amount of retards they had workin' for them.
Fuck you, you fat fuck.
Submit, bitch! Submit! Submit!
Suck my cock!
Keep fuckin' with me. Watch what happens.
All right, then.
I've been shit faced for like two weeks.
Chuckie, what the fuck happened?
Yeah, so he's like "Check the front of my truck, I can prove I hit it 'cause there's probably some blood or something"--
Stop brushin' me back!
Casey's bouncin' at a bar up Harvard. We should go there sometime.
What are we gonna do up there?
I don't know, we'll fuck up some smart kids. You'd prob'ly fit right in.
She's sharp as a marble.
She didn't do it again did she?
Jesus, that's really bad, did anyone even order a Flyin' Fish?
What do we got?
Hey, thanks for comin' out.
When's the arraignment?
What'd you get? You get leniency?
Probation, counselin', few days a week.
Who'd you call?
I didn't get on Cathy last night.
Why not?
I don't know what the fuck you're doin'. You're givin' us a ride.
What do I look like, Al Cowlins? You want to take my car, drop her off?
Thanks, Chuck.
How's the woman?
Gone.
What?
She went to Medical school in California.
Sorry, brother. I don't know what to tell ya. You know all the girls I been with. You been with 'em too, except for Cheryl McGovern which was a big mistake on your part brother...
Oh I'm sure, that's why only one of us has herpes.
Suck my crank. Fuckin' sheet metal pussy. So, when are you done with those meetin's?
Week after I'm twenty-one.
Are they hookin' you up with a job?
Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.
Yah, but it's better than this shit. At least you'd make some nice bank.
Yeah, be a fuckin' lab rat.
It's a way outta here.
What do I want a way outta here for? I want to live here the rest of my life. I want to be your next door neighbor. I want to take out kids to little league together up Foley Field.
Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' Patriots' games and still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. And that's not a threat, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.
Chuckie, what are you talkin'...
Listen, you got somethin' that none of us have.
Why is it always this? I owe it to myself? What if I don't want to?
Fuck you. You owe it to me. Tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and I'll be fifty and I'll still be doin' this. And that's all right 'cause I'm gonna make a run at it. But you, you're sittin' on a winning lottery ticket and you're too much of a pussy to cash it in. And that's bullshit 'cause I'd do anything to have what
You don't know that.
You and Morgan throw?
No, I had to talk him down.
Why didn't you yoke him?
You're kiddin' me.
Okay.
What class?
Ah, history I think.
Oh...
I'm glad you came by, changed my opinion of Harvard people.
Yeah, not tonight. Not any other night. He knows, once you see that shit-hole he's gettin' dropped like a bad habit.
Hi.
How you doin'?
How'd you know where to find me?
Oh, right.
I guess so.
What? No. This is my mother's house. I don't live with my mother. I just stop by, help out. I'm good like that.
Is this a bad time?
She'll live. If she starts yelling again I might have to run in real quick and beat her with the stick again but...
Okay.
See, now this doesn't feel right. When I made the decision to come over here it felt right. I had all these rationalizations... I just don't understand why Will never tells me anything, he won't let me get close to him, he tells me these weird lies--
You caught that, huh?
I just wanted to find out what was going on...But now that I'm here it seems strange, doesn't it?
I don't care what his family's like or if he doesn't have any brothers, but he doesn't have to lie to me.
Is that true?
--That isn't funny--
Jesus.
WILL!
Yah, that is a nice ass.
Fuck this, let's get something to eat...
What Morgan, you're not gonna go talk to her?
Morgan, I'm not goin' to "Kelly's Roast Beef" just cause you like the take-out girl. It's fifteen minutes out of our way. MORGAN What else we gonna do we can't spare fifteen minutes?
All right Morgan, fine. I'll tell you why we're not going to "Kelly's." It's because the take-out bitch is a fuckin' idiot. I'm sorry you like her but she's dumb as a post and she has never got our order right, never once.
Would you shut the fuck up! I know what you ordered, I was there!
So why don't you give me my sandwhich?
What do you mean "your sandwhich?" I bought it.
Yah, all right...
How much money you got?
I told you, I just got change.
Well give me your fuckin' change and we'll put your fuckin' sandwhich on lay-away.
Why you gotta be an asshole Chuckie?
Did she get my Double Burger?
Come on, Will...
Shut up.
Morgan, Let's go.
You got fired from pushing a broom, you little bitch.
My uncle can probably get you on my demo team.
What the fuck? I just asked you for a job yesterday!
Some other guy?
Yeah, he was probably drunker than my Uncle, who fuckin' knows? So the cop goes "Stay here" And he goes runnin' down the highway to deal with the other crash. So, my Uncle Marty's standin' on the side of the road for a little while, and he's so fuckin' lit, that he forgets what he's waitin' for. So he goes, "Fuck it." He gets
Holy shit.
