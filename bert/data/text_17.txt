Let's find a telephone.
Don't be afraid. You can tell me.
You're sure...
We found each other, didn't we?
Yes. We did.
What?
My name isn't Damon Bradley. I just told you it was Damon Bradley.
I don't get it. She hasn't seen her since she was a kid, now just because she's dying, all of the sudden she's gotta see her again?
She's been acting weird lately, though. I shoulda seen it coming. Babbling on and on and on about "communication". Like I don't know how to communicate.
Let's face it. Sooner or later we all die.
Who's dying?
Your great aunt.
You don't think this is just infatuation, do you?
Oh no. Do you?
I'm a liberal!
No...
There is one other thing you should know about me.
Nothing you could say would change the way I feel.
I'm engaged. I'm supposed to be married in two days.
And, he's a friend of yours. It's Dwayne.
Dwayne?
A very large pig.
Ask her if she knows where he is?
No.
Ask her if she knows how I might reach him? If she has a telephone number?
...has a prior commitment.
What's mezzaluna?
A restaurant. In Piazza Navona.
I'M NOT PUSHING IT.
Yeah, but, what if this guy lived a billion, trillion years ago? Like, what if he was a cave man, and now he's dead?
Yeah, but, what if he doesn't live here? Like, what if he's a cannibal in New Guinea or something?
We'll KNOW.
Larry! What are you doing here? Mom sent you.
Larry, can I borrow your car keys?
Faith, this guy you think is Mr. Right, he's... not what you think--
Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is. I know where to find him.
But, Faith--
I'll bring it back as soon as I can.
But Faith--
You...
Hi there...
It was the moth stuff that gave it away, didn't it? I knew that was too much.
No, you gave a very convincing performance. And you'll be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse.
Congratulations.
Thanks.
So, this is what you do? I mean when you're not playing other parts?
It's an amazing place, don't you think?
Amazing.
Smoking or non-smoking?
Lots of history. For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens?
Hm.
Hello? Is anybody there?
Dwayne Pinsley? I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
He's not in at the moment. Can I take a message?
Who's this?
This is his fiancee. Who's this?
I'm sure he'll be sorry to hear that. Who should I tell him called?
My name's
Damon Bradley...
WAIT!! Where are you?
I'm at the airport. Why?
Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
Where are you going?
I'm on my way to Venice. Why?
Venice? I love Venice. With the boats, right?...
That's not the point.
You said whatever it was you would understand.
How could you do this to me?
I'm in love with you.
You're limping.
I know I'm limping. I stubbed my toe.
Are you okay? You want some help?
NO.
Why can't you just tell me?
If it's any of your business, yes.
Yes?! To be married, I suppose.
Yes.
To the foot doctor.
Because I know who Dwayne is, and he's reliable and stable and wants to marry me.
He's safe.
So?! Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe?
Does he love you?
He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
You didn't answer my question.
Why are you asking me this?
You stubbed your toe, don't you think that's a sign?
What?
There must be something I can do, something I can say to make this up to you?... Just tell me what it is, I'll say it. I'll do it. I don't want you to hate me.
Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking. We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
So?
So it wasn't real.
What about the oasis in the desert? Are you telling me that was a lie?
Don't you see?.. We're not the ones who are meant to be. You're the man of somebody else's dreams.
Fine. Okay. Forget me. Leave me out of it. But don't go throwing your life away on somebody you don't love.
Why not?
I went back to that restaurant and I spoke with his waiter, just on an off chance, you know, and, anyway-- he knew the name of the guy's hotel. So, I called there, they said he left yesterday. But, apparently he comes here every year, always follows the same route. He always goes from here down the coast to the Le Sirenuse hotel in
Where's Positano?
It's in the south. I've still got my rental car. I can get you there by morning...
Oh no, I don't think that would be a good idea.
Why?
The guy at the hotel told me he always wears a gold medallion, and usually has a book or magazine with him.
Uh, I'd rather not say.
Tell me.
I'd really rather not say.
Please. I need to know.
Mickey Spillane.
Mickey Spillane?
He's out by the pool right now.
Right now?
Do you want me to do it?
Hi, Peter.
So. You found him.
Well, it looks like we both lucked out. I just met somebody myself. Somebody my aunt introduced me to.
Oh. That's nice.
And she's a knock-out, too.
Well, good. Good for you.
Where are you going? Just-- out of curiosity...
Oh, thanks. Well, have a good time.
Hey--
What?
Nice dress.
What?...
What are you doing here?
You were saying...
Say, I saw where they had motor boats for rent down in the harbor. Why don't we all go for an evening cruise around the bay?
Why are you doing this?
I just wanted to keep an eye on you. The guy's a total stranger, remember?
So were you.
Well, what about books? You like Hemingway? You gotta love Hemingway.
How about music? You like classical?
Well, how about those old romantic movies with those great stars, huh? Like Audrey Hepburn.
You okay?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Yeah. Well, was the least I could do.
Promise me you won't leave without saying goodbye.
Hi.
Hi. Are you... busy?
No. Are you're leaving?
It seems like ever since I found out about this guy, this name, I've been kind of crazy. Like I was on drugs or something.
I know the feeling.
Yeah... Well, anyway, I also wanted to tell you, I'm not getting married.
You aren't?
No. I mean yes, I'm not. I decided to call it off. Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.
Well. Congratulations.
Thank you. So, since I have a few more days of vacation left, I was wondering if maybe you'd want to do something sometime. I mean, you know, if you don't have... other plans.
Yes. I am.
You can't come to Southern Italy and not see the Blue Grotto.
I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
Is something the matter?
I'd call that a yes. Do I get a hint?
You want a hint? I'll give you a hint. You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine--
There's no such thing.
What?
Reptilian swine. There's no such thing. Reptiles aren't swine.
Who cares?! You hired an actor??
I don't know what you're talking about. Who told you that?
Alright. The truth is... I thought we had something here.
I can't believe you did that!
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
I sabotaged it? You're the one who lost him, remember?
Well, I might've found him again if I hadn't left Rome to make this pointless trip down here with you.
As I recall, you were on your way home. And I didn't want you to go so, yes, I told you a little white lie.
A "little white lie"? A "little white lie"?
What would you call it?
Don't you think you're overreacting just a little here? We're talking about love, okay? Let's be rational.
Rational?! Love is not rational! Are you crazy?
Yes. I'm crazy. You have driven me crazy. No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you. Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up? How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated?
Gee, I'm flattered. What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.
Very funny.
Really?...
And this is the thanks I get. I did you a favor. You never wanted to marry that joker in the first place.
That's not the point. And what if I had wanted to?
Look, I just thought if you finally got rid of this obsession with this name, if you could get it out of your system once and for all, then maybe you'd be able to stop waiting and open your heart to someone real. Granted, ideally, me. I didn't do it to hurt you. I did it for you. I did it for us...
I was hoping for the real thing.
You're Damon Bradley?
Hello.
Beautiful place...
Been here long?
Just since yesterday.
I was wondering... Do you have dinner plans?
Tonight?
Any night.
Well, not exactly...
Sure.
I'll look forward to it.
Wait.
Yes?
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
Oh, Faith. My name's Faith.
Sure.
You know, I noticed you out at the pool even before we spoke. I could sense the chemistry between us.
Really?
Well, to-- new friends.
Excuse me?
Nothing. Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?
What looks good?
Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...
So what do you think?
Faith, this is my mother.
Oh, hello.
So, you say you've been to Italy before?
So, what are we waiting for?
What?
I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it... Is Larry here?
I don't believe in statistics.
What about that guy you work with, Mike what's-his-name?
No. He smokes.
How about the other one? His friend.
Just moved in with his girlfriend.
Scientologist.
So, you gotta be a little flexible. Look at your brother and me. Larry's not perfect, neither am I. But we work it out. We're not unrealistic in our expectations, and we have each other. I think you've got the Door Number Three Syndrome.
I don't have an Amana freezer.
It's a metaphor. It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them. And instead wind up with nothing.
Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer.
Is everything okay?
Yes. You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.
But somebody wrote those songs.
So, what's your point?
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
I wish you didn't have to go so early.
No.
Is he married?
No.
Is he gay?
I don't know. I don't think so.
So?...
What's he do?
I don't know, Kate.
You don't have any idea?
"Thrills"? That's what you're waiting for? You know how long that lasts? Besides, how do you know? Have you ever been out with him?
No. He's never asked me.
Why don't you ask him?
Why should I ask someone out who I don't want to go out with in the first place?
He begged me to marry him. I didn't even want to marry him.
Yes you did.
Come on, it's not so bad.
Look how big it makes me look. I look like an Alp.
I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
But what?
Oh, I don't know. I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be. You know, like in the movies.
But one day you wake up and realize you've been had. Of course life isn't like the movies. That's why there are movies.
Let me tell you something about love. There are no prince charmings, there are no glass slippers. Love is hard work.
I know. You're right.
I understand, Kate. What do you think of this garter?
Kate, is something the matter?
Larry brought me flowers last night.
Is that bad?...
Have you seen him with someone?
No... I can just tell.
It's a miracle.
It's a coincidence.
It was my New Year's resolution to overcome it.
But it's July.
It's still the new year...
What about your job?
I have vacation time coming to me.
You don't have a passport.
That's where you're wrong. I got one nine years ago. I just never had an opportunity to use it.
Because you were afraid to fly.
Would you stop saying that? I need you to do me a really big favor.
Does Dwayne know about this?
I can't believe we did this. Do I have to remind you that your wedding is in six days?
No, I haven't. And you forgot about the fortune teller.
Thank you so much.
You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets?
A foreign land full of millions of Italian men... speaking Italian with Italian accents and those huge brown eyes and that silky olive skin...
How hard can it be? I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and--
Live happily ever after.
I keep it in the glove compartment in case of emergencies.
You okay?
Now what do we do?
The book said they have boats that are like taxis... Vaporettos. What's the name of the place we're staying again?
It's called... the Gritty Palace.
"Gritty"? Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
This is a Lifestyles hotel.
What?
"Of the Rich and Famous". Of which we are neither. Are you out of your mind? We can't afford this.
Are you sure?
Yes. Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
I can't believe we came all this way and he's gone.
You gave it your best shot. You tried.
I'll never meet the man of my dreams.
Just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for.
What are you doing?
You can't really blame him for being upset. It was an Armani suit.
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
I just got a dial tone--
The guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago, right?
So?
Ah ha!...
What'd you find?
A Butterfinger wrapper.
A rich, possibly fat, slob.
Maybe there's fingerprints on it?
We're not looking to arrest the man, Faith, we're trying to locate him.
We're saved!
What is it?
A phone message. Only--
Only what?
Your brother?
Couldn't we just have taken a train?
I told you a liter was less than a gallon.
We would've had enough gas to get us there if you hadn't gotten us lost. Besides, a kilometer is less than a mile.
I'm hungry.
You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
What's that supposed to mean?...
You expecting somebody you know?
Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
So, what exactly is Larry's side of the story, anyway?
I don't know, Kate. I just said that. I'm sorry. I'm just on edge. I'm afraid we're losing him.
You think he misses me at all?
'Course he does.
That was a long time ago.
He went out and bought himself men's cologne the other day. Did I tell you that?
Larry bought himself cologne?
Anna, I'm Faith. You don't know how happy I am to meet you. You see, I'm trying to find someone, and--
Her brother.
What did you say to her?
I don't know. I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden--
All of the sudden, I'm feeling kind of nervous. God, I hate blind dates. Why couldn't we just have arranged marriages in America?
I sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe he'd notice me first?
So what's in a name? I wanna join him. I don't see why we can't join him.
Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?
Because I'm the one who's single.
I never even got to be single.
Sure you did.
Not if you don't count the sixth grade.
He's heeeeeerrre...
Oh my God. Where?
He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us. He's wearing a navy jacket. If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow.
Is he looking at us?
Right, right... Okay.. You don't think he's gonna think I'm too aggressive?
Faith. So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe. At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales.
Faith--
What?
Well, nobody can say we didn't try.
Okay, here's what I think. We find out what all the subway stops for that train are-- the subway system's really not that big in Rome, we could narrow it down and--
And then what, Faith?
That was really sweet...
I meant about my idea.
I think it's time we got some professional help.
Like a detective.
No... Like a psychiatrist.
Yeah. Sociopaths. They're able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that.
But how could he know? He only just met me.
Hi-iii...
Hi. Where've you been?
Sightseeing... What're you doing?
Packing.
Why?
Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning. This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
So, you've had a little bad luck.
A little bad luck?
Why do they read kids fairy tales in the first place? Children are very impressionable, you know.
I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place.
I know, but...
It was a ouija board, remember?
...and a fortune teller.
Yeah, well, obviously it wasn't meant to be. I've got forty-eight hours. I can still make it home in time to marry Dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened.
What about Peter?...
Peter? Peter was a mistake. An imposter.
The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind. May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour.
Who said I was going?
What?
No. No, you go ahead.
You sure you'll be okay?
I'm sure. And Kate, thank you for coming. Thank you for being such a good friend.
Peter found him?
Amazing...
Joan Collins stayed here.
Whatareyoudoing?!
What if he doesn't like me?
It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable.
My God... you're right.
Kate. Thank God you're there. I need help.
Not only is he a momma's boy and a fascist, he says "nuculear" and "irregardless".
No one's perfect, Kate.
And he is living proof.
Maybe I can change him.
Maybe if I kiss him I'll feel it.
He's a jerk.
Yes. He is.
I spent my whole life waiting for a creep.
Yup.
I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel.
So...
Kate is that you?
Uh huh.
Well, I realized, if you're getting married, you're gonna be needing the maid of honor, right?
Actually, no. There's not going to be a wedding.
Well... I ought to be getting home anyway. The kids'll be back from camp soon. The house is probably a mess.
And Larry?...
What about Larry?
I'm fine. Have you seen Peter?
He's gone. He told me what happened. He just left for the airport.
And you are?...
Kate.
You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate?
No. Well, I don't know. Well, maybe. Later.
My friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is. Can you tell us what she's saying?
She's saying he's a-- a-- porco.
A porco?
Oh.
Giovanni, this is Faith's friend, Peter.
Oh, hello. I just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink, but--
It's siesta.
Oh.
How old are you?
Giovanni, I want to thank you.
No, you don't understand. It's been wonderful meeting you. But... I have a husband. I have two kids at camp. I have a life I have to go back to.
You don't have to go if you don't want to...
You think I'm just one of those Italian Casanovas. The guys who try to seduce every woman who comes their way. Who prey on unhappily married women. Who lure unsuspecting--
Giovanni.
Huh?
Kate, you're still there? I thought you'd be on your way home by now.
You miss me?...
Uh, yeah. Sure. Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?
No, why?
This is the last one before the wedding, right?
Right.
And we didn't have to bring another present?
Not only is it tacky, it's exploitation.
It's not exploitation. These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation? She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.
Sociologist. And because. Pawn shops are just like prostitutes, farm auctions and coal miners. They're all for sale, but none of 'em would be if they weren't desperate for the money.
We're all desperate for the money, doll. That's what made this country great. Back me up on this Candy, am I right?
Don't call me doll, Larry. I hate it when you call me doll.
You used to love it when I called you doll.
Damon Bradley? That's why you're here?
What? You know him?
It was just a joke. I was pushing the arrow. I wanted to get to the next question. I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.
Are you saying you just made the whole thing up? The guy never even existed?
He existed. He was some kid I knew from Little League. He was a real jerk. You say he's a friend of Dwayne's?
I thought she'd get a kick out of it.
It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?
Larry, you've got to tell her.
I came after the woman I love.
Yeah--
She what?!
She said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and--
And you didn't tell her?
I have to talk to her.
She's not here.
Where is she?
She went out to check into skywriting. I can't believe you lied. Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
It was an emergency. I only lied that night because it was the only way I knew to stop her. I knew if I didn't, I'd never see her again.
Good strategy.
And then I saw her. And all I know is, when I looked in her eyes I saw something... light. And life and passion and yearning. And something else I can't even put my finger on, something I'd never seen before--
Mania.
And if that's not destiny, I don't know what is.
I mean, realistically, what are the odds that this is a terrific guy?
That's the guy you've been waiting for all these years?
Oh, it's you. It's only Peter.
Thanks.
Right now?
He just got a call from "Mr. Upstairs." Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot.
I'm gonna take her home first.
I'd get over there, Terry. I'll take the little lady home.
I'll come over when I'm ready.
And don't be walking off with any of that. You know how the boss feels about individual pilferage.
Talk louder. I can't hear you.
If you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth
If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
And what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it?
You mean to sit there and tell me that your local takes in sixty-five thousand, five hundred dollars every year and keeps no financial records?
Sure we keep records!
Well, where are they?
We was robbed last night and we can't find no books.
Doesn't it seem odd to you that five different waterfront locals were broken into last night and the only articles removed were financial records?
What do you mean, odd? We was robbed like I told you.
What gives with our boy tonight, Charley? He ain't himself.
The Joey Doyle thing. You know how he is. Things like that he exaggerates them. Too much Marquis of Queensbury. It softens 'em up.
When he got up and chased them they thought it was a dead man coming after them.
I know what's eatin' you, kid. But I got two thousand dues-payin' members in my local that's seventy-two thousand a year legitimate and when each one of 'em puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work steady well, you figure it out. And that's just for openers. We got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the world.
Why shouldn't we? If we c'n get it we're entitled to it.
We ain't robbin' pennies from beggars. We cuttin' ourselves in for five-six million a year just on our half a dozen piers a drop in the bucket compared to the traffic in the harbor. But a mighty sweet little drop, eh, Charley?
It'll do.
I make it twentysix twenty-three. You're fifty short, Skins.
You got a real friend here, kid. Don't forget it.
Drink up, Charley. We're ahead of you.
I'm not thirsty.
After what we been hearing about your brother, I thought your throat'd be kind of dry.
So they're walking along and smiling. That doesn't mean he's going to talk. There's no evidence until he gives public testimony.
Thanks for the legal advice, Charley. That's what we always kept you around for. Now how do we keep him from giving this testimony? Isn't that the er as you put it main order of business?
This girl and the Father got their hooks in him so deep he doesn't know which end is up anymore.
I ain't interested in his mental condition. All I want to know is, is he D 'n D or is he a canary?
I wish I knew.
So do I, Charley. For your sake.
What do you want me to do, Johnny?
Very simple. Just bring him to... that place we been using. Mac, you take care of the details. Call Gerry G. in if you think you need him.
Gerry G!! You don't want to do that, Johnny! Sure the boy's outa line, but he's just a confused kid.
Confused kid? First he crosses me in public and gets away with it and then the next joker, and pretty soon I'm just another fellow down here.
Johnny, I can't do that. I can't do that, Johnny.
Then don't.
But my own kid bro
You said they was only going to talk to him.
That was the idea.
I thought they'd talk to him. Try to get him to dummy up.
Maybe he gave them an argument.
I figured the worst they'd do is work him over a little.
Come on, kid. I'll buy you a drink.
Working hard?
You don't mind working once in a while to justify this lofty position?
I just fnished work. I counted the bags.
We got a little extra detail for you. The local priest and this Doyle girl are getting up a meeting in the church. We'd like a rundown on it. You know, names and numbers of all the players. You're nominated.
Why me, Charley? I'd feel funny going in there.
Johnny does you favors, kid. You got to do a little one for him once in a while.
But going in that church, I'd be stooling for you, Charley. You make a pigeon out of me.
The complete works of Timothy J. Nolan.
Gee, Charley, I'm sure glad you stopped by for me. I needed to talk to you. What's it they say about blood, it's
River Street? I thought we was going to the Garden.
I've got to cover a bet there on the way over. Anyway, it gives us a chance to talk.
Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley.
The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.
That's right... .
Of course, the boys know you too well to mark you down for a cheese-eater.
Mmhmm.
You know, the boys are getting rather interested in your future.
Mmhmmm.
They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.
A steady job and a few bucks extra, that's all I wanted.
Sure, that's all right when you're a kid, but you'll be pushing thirty pretty soon, slugger. It's time you got some ambition.
I always figured I'd live longer without it.
There's a slot for a boss loader on the new pier we're opening up.
Boss loader!
Ten cents a hundred pounds on everything that moves in and out. And you don't have to lift a finger. It'll be three-four hundred a week just for openers.
And for all that dough I don't do nothin'?
Absolutely nothing. You do nothing and you say nothing. You understand, don't you, kid?
Yeah yeah I guess I do but there's a lot more to this whole thing than I thought, Charley.
You don't mean you're thinking of testifying against
I don't know I don't know! I tell you I ain't made up my mind yet. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Listen, Terry, these piers we handle through the locals you know what they're worth to us?
I know. I know.
Well, then, you know Cousin Johnny isn't going to jeopardize a setup like that for one rubber-lipped
Don't say that!
ex-tanker who's walking on his heels ?
Don't say that!
What the hell!!!
I could have been better!
I tell you, Charley, I haven't made up my mind!
Make up your mind, kid, I beg you, before we get to four thirty-seven River... .
Take the boss loading, kid. For God's sake. I don't want to hurt you.
Charley... . Charley... . Wow... .
Wow... .
What do you weigh these days, slugger?
...eight-seven, eighty-eight. What's it to you?
Gee, when you tipped one seventy-five you were beautiful. You should've been another Billy Conn. That skunk I got to manage you brought you along too fast.
It wasn't him! It was you, Charley. You and Johnny. Like the night the two of youse come in the dressing room and says, "Kid, this ain't your night we're going for the price on Wilson." It ain't my night. I'd of taken Wilson apart that night! I was ready remember the early rounds throwing them combinations. So what happens This bum Wilson he
I always had a bet down for you. You saw some money.
See! You don't understand!
I tried to keep you in good with Johnny.
It was you, Charley... .
Time and faith... . My brother's dead and you stand there talking drivel about time and faith.
Why Edie, I
How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me who? -- who?
I wish I knew, Edie, But
Don't turn away! Look at it! You're in this too don't you see, don't you see? You're in this too, Father.
Edie, I do what I can. I'm in the church when you need me.
Father Barry.
Hello, Edie.
I'm afraid I spoke out of turn last night.
What happened? What happened?
Terry...?
They're waiting for him to walk in.
Oh, I thought you was gonna go to work with all them muscles.
Give it to me my Pop's job
What makes him so special?
None of your business.
I think we're O.K.
Thanks. Steel pipes and baseball bats.
They play pretty rough.
Which side are you with?
I'm with Terry.
I'll get home all right now.
Everybody loved Joey. From the little kids to the old rummies. Did you know him very well?
Everybody knew him. He got around.
What did that man mean when he said you were... .?
Aah, he's a bottlebaby, he talks to himself, the joke of the neighborhood.
You know how the Sisters are.
You training to be a nun or something?
It's a regular college. It's just run by the nuns. The Sisters of St. Anne.
And you spend all your time just learning stuff, huh?
I want to be a teacher.
A teacher! Dong!!! You know I admire brains. Take my brother Charley. He's very brainy. Very.
It isn't brains. It's how you use them.
Yeah. Yeah. I get your thought. You know I seen you lots of times before. Parochial school on Pulaski Street? Seven, eight years ago? Your hair come down in
In braids? That's right.
Looked like two pieces of rope. And your teeth were
I know. I thought I'd never get those braces off.
Man, you were a mess!
I can get home all right from here
The thought I'm tryin' to get over is you grew up beauteeful. Remember me?
The moment I saw you.
Some people got faces that stick in your mind.
I remember you were in trouble all the time.
Now you got me! It's a wonder I wasn't punchy by the time I was twelve. The rulers those Sisters used to whack me with! They thought they could beat an education into meI foxed 'em.
Maybe they just didn't know how to handle you.
How would you've done it?
What's that?
Pardon me while I reach for my beads.
What?
What-what? Where you been the last four five years? Outer space?
When Mother died Pop sent me out to school in the country. He was afraid with no one home I'd get into bad company.
Boy, they sure fly nice, don't they?
Do you like pigeons?
I'd better go in.
I only live up there and across the roof.
Thanks anyway.
Listen, Edie, am I going to see you again?
What for?
I don't know.
I changed my mind. I feel real mean tonight.
The Golden Warriors.
Here they come! The champion flock of the neighborhood.
You don't mind yourself at all, do you. Joey used to race pigeons.
He had a few birds. I got up and fed 'em this morning.
That was nice of you.
I like pigeons. You send a bird five hundred miles away he won't stop for food or water until he's back in his own coop.
I wouldn't have thought you'd be so interested in pigeons.
I go for this stuff. You know this city's full of hawks? There must be twenty thousand of 'em. They perch on top of the big hotels and swoop down on the pigeons in the park.
The things that go on.
How do you like that one?
If another fella tries to take that perch away from him, he lets him have it.
Even pigeons aren't peaceful.
Listen, you like beer?
I don't know.
Want to go out and have one with me?
In a saloon?
Likewise. And draw two for chasers. Now you're beginning to live.
Wham... .
How do you like it?
It's quite nice.
How about another one?
No thanks... .
Were you really a prize fighter?
I went pretty good for a while, didn't I, Al? But I didn't stay in shape and I had to take a few dives.
A dive? You mean, into the water?
Now what are you doing?
Describing you. A square from out there. I mean you're nowhere. Miss Four Corners.
What made you want to be a fighter?
I had to scrap all my life. Figured I might as well get paid for it. When I was a kid my old man got killednever mind how. Charley and I was put in a placethey called it a Children's Home. Some home! I run away and peddled papers, fought in club smokers and But what am I runnin' off at the mouth for?
Shouldn't we care about everybody?
What a fruitcake you are!
Isn't everybody part of everybody else?
Gee, thoughts! Alla time thoughts! You really believe that drool?
Terry!
Want to hear my philosophy? Do it to him before he does it to you.
Our Lord said just the opposite.
I'm not lookin' to get crucified. I'm lookin' to stay in one piece.
I never met such a person. Not a spark of romance or sentiment or or human kindness in your whole body.
What do they do for you, except get in your way?
And when things get in your way or people you just knock them aside get rid of Them is that your idea?
Listen get this straight don't look at me when you say them things. It wasn't my fault what happened to your brother. Fixing Joey wasn't my idea... .
Why, Terry, who said it was?
Well, nobody, I guess. But that Father Barry, I didn't like the way he kept lookin' at me.
He was looking at everybody the same way. Asking the same question.
Yeah, yeah... . This Father Barry, what's his racket?
His racket?
You've been off in daisyland, honey. Everybody's got a racket.
You don't believe in anything, do you?
Edie, down here it's every man for himself. It's keepin' alive! It's standin' in with the right people so you can keep a little loose change jinglin' in your pocket.
And if you don't?
If you don't Keep your neck in and your nose clean and You'll never have no trouble down here.
Like Joey? Are you afraid to mention his name?
I I'd like to, Edie, but there's nothin' I can do. Edie feels subdued, ashamed at breaking down. She rises, and in a low voice says
All right, all right.. I shouldn't 've asked you.
You haven't finished your beer.
I don't want it. But why don't you stay and finish your drink.
You're not sore at me?
What for?
What are you crying for?
I I never knew a girl like you, Edie. I always knew the kind you just grab 'em And I never knew a girl like you, Edie.
Edie, listen, stay out of this mess. Quit tryin' to ask things about Joey. It ain't safe for you.
Why worry about me? You're the one who says only look out for yourself.
Okay, get in hot water. But don't come hollerin' to me when you get burned.
Why should I come hollering to you at all?
Because... because... Listen Edie, don't get sore now but I think we're getting in love with each other.
I can't let myself fall in love with you.
What are you going to do?
I won't eat cheese for no cops, that's for sure.
Edie, your old man's right, go back to that school out in daisyland. You're driving yourself nuts you're driving me nuts stop worrying about the truth worry about yourself.
Look out for number one. Always number one. I should've known you wouldn't tell me. Pop said Johnny Friendly used to own you. I think he still owns you. No wonder everybody calls you a bum.
It's true.
I'm tryin' to keep you from being hurt What more do you want?
Edie!
I I brought this for you, Terry. It was Joey's. Yours is coming out at the elbows.
I don't rate it.
Pigeons... .
Edie I I never said this to a girl before, I never knew a girl worth trying to say it for, but you you're... .
Edie... Edie... ..
Terry, what's wrong?
I've been sittin' in the church.
You?
Yeah, yeah, it's up to me, it's up to me he says it's up to me.
Who says?
Terry what's happening to you?
I just told the Father.
Told him what?
What I did to Joey.
You... .
What I did to Joey.
Don't tell me don't tell me!
I had to, Edie. I had to see you.
Lucky Pop isn't home, he'd kill you.
You think I stink, don't you? You think I stink for what I told you?
I don't want to talk about it. I want you to go.
Edie, listen to me! I want you to believe me. I want to be with you.
How can you be with Charley and Johnny Friendly and still be with me? Either way it's a lie. It's like there were two different people inside of you. You've got to be one or the other.
I don't want to hurt Charley I don't want to hurt you...
It's you who's being hurt. By keeping it inside you, like a poison. Sooner or later it's got to come out.
I know what you want me to do!
I don't want you to do anything. Let your conscience tell you what to do.
That word again! Why do you keep saying conscience, conscience... .
I never mentioned the word before. In his agony he grips a glass standing on the night table.
My hand.
It's just a scratch. You won't die. She turns away from him.
Edie...
Get away from me.
Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you love me.
I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me.
Terry, I'm frightened. More and more frightened.
Charley.
I'll take it out of their skulls.
I don't want to see you killed. I want to live with you. Live with you. Any place it's safe to walk the streets without... .
Terry, no, no... .
Terry, you're bleeding.
Do what I told you. Take care of Charley.
Terry, for God's sake.
Get out of my way.
Edie.
I thought you might want some hot coffee.
Thanks just the same.
Well, it's over.
But I feel like My friends won't talk to me.
Jimmy...
He's going to have to grow up too.
My pigeons... .
Terry, you better stay in for a while. I'll come and cook your meals. Be sure you keep the door locked.
Every one of 'em... .
You heard what Johnny said. No part of the Waterfront'll be safe for you now. Maybe inland the Middle West somewhere a job on a farm... .
Then go ahead go ahead! Go down to the shape-up and get yourself killed, you stupid, pigheaded, son of a What are you trying to prove? With a decisive gesture Terry takes the hook and sticks it through his belt. Then he goes to the wall and lifts Joey's windbreaker from the nail on which it has been hanging. He puts the windbreaker on
Am I on my feet...?
You're all packed. And here's your bus ticket. You're on your way back to St. Anne's.
Pop, I'm not ready to go back yet.
Edie, for years we pushed quarters into a cookie jar, to keep you up there with the Sisters, and to keep you from things like I just seen out the window. My own daughter arm-in-arm with Terry Malloy. You know who Terry Malloy is?
Who is he, Pop?
Who is he! Edie, you're so softhearted and soft-headed you wouldn't recognize the devil if he had you by the throat. You know who this Terry Malloy is? The kid brother of Charlie the Gent, Johnny Friendly's right hand, a butcher in a camel hair coat.
Are you trying to tell me Terry is too?
I'm not trying to tell you he's Little Lord Fauntleroy.
He tries to act tough, but there's a look in his eyes that... .
A look in his eyes! Hold your hats, brother, here we go again. You think he's one of those cases you're always draggin' in and feelin' sorry for. Like the litter of kittens you hadthe only one she wants to keep has six toes and it's cockeyed to boot. Look at him. The bum! And the crush you had on that little Abyssinian... .
He wasn't Abyssinian, Pop, Assyrian... .
Six-toed cats. Assyrians. Abyssinians. It's the same difference. Well don't think this Terry Malloy is any six-toed cockeyed Assyrian. He's a bum. Charley and Johnny Friendly owned him when he was a fighter and when they ring the bell he still goes into action.
He wanted to see me again.
You think we kept you out in Tarrytown just to have you go walkin' with a corner saloon hoodlum like Terry Malloy? Now get back to Tarrytown, before I put a strap to you.
And learn about charity and justice and all the other things people would rather talk about than practice? Pop goes up to her and holds out his two arms, his right one closer to Edie; he trembles with emotion.
Pop, don't think I'm not feeling grateful for all you've done to get me an education and shelter me from this. But now my eyes are open. I see things I know are so wrong how can I go back and keep my mind on things that are only in books and that people aren't living? I'm staying, Pop. And I'm going to keep
You are like
Where you goin'?
What's the matter? I've got something That's chokin' me. I've gotta get it out.
Someone else c'n take your confession.
But you're the one I want to tell what you said over Nolan about keepin' silent when you know the score I'm guilty you hear me? I'm guilty... .
I don't want to hear it in there.
I don't get it!
Tell it to me in there and my lips are sealed. But if I dig it out myself I can use it where it'll do the most good.
But you've got to listen to me.
It started as a favor for my brother you know they'd ask me things and it's hard to say no a favor Who am I kiddin'? They call it a favor but it's do it or else. And this time the favor turned out to be helping them knock off Joey. I just thought they'd lean on him a little but Last night with
What are you going to do?
About Edie?
Edie. The Commission. Your subpoena. I know you got a subpoena.
It's like carrying a monkey around on your back.
A question of who rides who.
If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel.
How much is your soul worth if you don't?
But it's my own brother they're askin' me to finger and Johnny Friendly. His mother and my mother was first cousins. When I was this high he took me to the ball games... .
Ball games! Don't break my heart! I wouldn't care if he gave you a life pass to the Polo Grounds. So you got a brother. Well, let me tell you something you got some other brothers and they're all getting the short end while your cousin Johnny gets mustard on his face at the Polo Grounds. If I was you  Listen, I'm not
Conscience... . I didn't even know I had one until I met you and Edie... this conscience stuff can drive you nuts.
Good luck.
I want to see you, Terry.
You got eyes. I'm right in front of you.
Now don't give me a hard time.
What do you want from me, Father.
Your gun.
Mind your own business, Father.
This is my business.
Why don't you go and chase yourself?
Give me that gun.
You go to hell.
What did you say?
Take your hands off me. What you call me?
...walk?
You can!
Who asked him here?
Now listen, if you know who the pistols are, if you see them on the dock every day, are you going to keep still until they cut you down one by one? Are you? Are you? How about you, Nolan?
Father, one thing you got to understand. On the dock we've always been D 'n D.
D 'n D?
You all right, Nolan?
Yeah, considerin' they was usin' my head for a baseball!
Nice fellows.
Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies but
You still call it ratting?
Are you on the level, Father?
What do you think?
If I stick my neck out, and they chopped it off, would that be the end of it? Or are you ready to go all the way?
I'll go down the line, Kayo, believe me.
Baseball bats that's just for openers. They'll put the muscle on you, turned-around collar or no turned-around collar.
And I still say you stand up and I'll stand up with you.
Down to the wire?
So help me God!
You're Terry Malloy, aren't you?
What about it?
I thought I recognized you. Saw you fight in St. Nick's a couple of years ago.
O.K. O.K. Without the bird seed. What do you want?
Waterfront Crime Commission ? What's that?
We're getting ready to hold public hearings on waterfront crime and underworld infiltration of longshore unions.
Never will be much too soon.
You're being served with a subpoena, Mr. Malloy.
What?
Be at the State House, Courtroom Nine, at ten o'clock tomorrow.
I told you I don't know nothin' and I ain't saying nothin'.
You can bring a lawyer if you wish. And you're privileged under the Constitution to protect yourself against questions that might implicate you in any crimes.
You looking for me?
I guess it's pretty tough work at that.
Didn't I see you fight in the Garden one night three or four years ago? With a fellow called Wilson?
Wilson yeah yeah I fought Wilson.
I thought you were going to take him that night but...
You want to know something I would have taken Wilson
I think you could have.
If I licked him I would have had the title shot instead of him boy, I was ready that night.
Yeah. Johnny Friendly and my brother had other ideas.
Such as what?
Listen, this ain't for publication.
I'm just resting my feet.
Remember the first round how I had him against the ropes, and
I'll never forget it. I thought it was all over.
Yeah. My own blood and they sell me out for a lousy bet I had it in me to hit the top and Boy, if I wanted to, the things I could tell you about them guys
Well, I better get going. Hit those stairs again. Was that a looping right or an uppercut the first time you caught him?
Looping right! I never swung wild. I was strictly a short puncher hooks over 'n under  whop-whop!
Really?
Where you going? I'll walk along with you.
Condolences. How you fixed for cabbage this mornin'?
Some chance at ten percent a week! And if he don't borrow, he don't work.
You'll work.
I ought to belt you one, J.P.
Raise a hand to me and... .
... .and you'll tell Johnny Friendly.
You're doin' lovely, Terry, very lovely.
What's the matter wit' you, success gone to ya head?
I told you lay off.
How do you like them jokers? Taking me for a pigeon.
Didn't you recognize him, dopey. That's Old Man Doyle.
I was gonna feed 'em, Terry.
's all right, kid. I took care of 'em myself this morning.
Boy, you must've been up early.
I wonder how long she's goin' to hang around, huh, Terry?
She's a he. His name is Swifty.
Better.
Hey, Terry, guess who's here... that joker from the Commission... .
Looking for me?
He's got his nerve, gum-shoeing around here after what you told him.
Jimmy, suppose I knew something, say a mug somebody put on somebody... . You think I should turn him in?
A cheese-eater! You're kidding!
Yeah, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You don't think I should turn him in... .
You was a Golden Warrior.
Yeah us Golden Warriors. You're a good kid, Jimmy, a good tough kid. We stick together, huh, kid?
You was our first Supreme Commander, Terry. Keep out of sight and I'll tell him you're out.
Is Johnny in?
No.
Give me a double.
Take it easy now, Terry.
What's wrong with your shoulder?
Hit me again.
No advice. Just whiskey.
You ought to go home and take care of that
Terry? What do you want?
Yeah? Must be Danny-boy. I lost him in the last race.
He followed my birds into their coop. Here, you want him?
Well I got to watch myself these days. Know what I mean?
I'll bring him up to your loft.
Hey, Skins --get away with that sheet metal all right?
Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss.
Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
Forty-five bills.
I I musta counted wrong, boss, I
H'ya, slugger, how they hangin'?
So-so, Johnny.
Count this.
Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny.
Shut up. I like the kid. Remember the night he took Farella at St. Nick's, Charley. We won a bundle. Real tough. A big try.
Not a dent. Perfect
My favorite little cousin.
Thirty-six sev aah I lost the count.
I know, Johnny, I know... .
Do you?
You come from Green Point? Go back to Green Point. You don't work here no more. Here, kid, here's half a bill. Go get your load on.
Naw, thanks, Johnny, I don't want it, I
Go on a little present from your Uncle Johnny. And Mac, tomorra mornin' when you shape the men put Terry in the loft. Number one. Every day. Nice easy work. Check in and goof off on the coffee bags. O.K.?
I I was just on my way up, Johnny.
It must have been once too often. I think your brains come apart. What you got up there, Chinese bells?
Aw, Johnny... .
I thought you were gonna keep an eye on that church meeting.
Nothing happened, Johnny.
Nothing happened, he says. Some operator you got yourself there, Charley. One more like him and we'll all be wearing striped pajamas.
It was a big nothing! The Father did all the talking.
Oh, he did. Half an hour later a certain Timothy J. Nolan went into secret session with the Commission and he did all the talking.
You mean Kayo Nolan, the old timer? He doesn't know much.
He don't, huh? Well, he knows thirty-nine pages worth of our operation.
How'd you get that.
Guts! A crummy pigeon who's looking to get his neck wrung! You should have You should have known better than to trust this punched out brother of yours. He was all right hanging around for laughs. But this is business. I don't like goofoffs messing in our business.
You want to know the trouble with you? You think it makes you a big man if you can give the answers.
Listen, Johnny
Go on beat it. Don't push your luck.
You want to know somethin'?
You want to know something? Take the heater away and you're nothin' take the good goods away, and the kickback and the shakedown cabbage away and the pistoleros away and you're a great big hunk of nothing Your guts is all in your wallet and your trigger finger!
Go on talkin'. You're talkin' yourself right into the river. Go on, go on... .
I'm glad what I done today, see? You give it to Joey, you give it to Nolan, you give it to Charley who was one of your own. You thought you was God Almighty instead of a cheap connivinggood-for-nothing bum! So I'm glad what I done you hear me? glad what I done!
You ratted on us, Terry.
From where you stand, maybe. But I'm standing over here now. I was rattin' on myself all them years and didn't know it, helpin' punks like you against people like Pop and Nolan an'... .
You got some nerve.
You know what I mean. Leave her alone.
I was only talkin' to her.
She's off limits for bums like you. Leave her alone.
I can look at her, can't I? It's a free country.
Tippi-tippi-tim, tippi-tim, Tippi-tippi-tan, tippi-tan... Gotta dime for a crippled-up docker?
Go on, beat it!
A dime, Terry, a dime for a cup of coffee?
Don't give me that coffee, you rummy. Now blow!
A dime. One thin dime for a cup of coffee.
Coffee, that's a laugh. His belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey.
Yeah, yeah Here's half a buck, go have yourself a ball.
I can't believe it a small fortune. You can't buy me you're still a bum! 'Bye, Edie. Lord have mercy on Joey.
A banana boat. It would be bananas. One of these days me ship's comin' in from Ireland, God love 'er, loaded to the gunnels with sweet Irish whiskey!
You see, Kayo, the good Lord watches over us after all.
You think one bottle's enough for all them toasts?
I was afraid one bottle might get lonely by itself. Now you see the advantage of a little man in a big coat.
Definitely! Nolan, my boy, you're a walkin' distillery.
The brother of Charley the Gent. They'll help us get to the bottom of the river.
Keep Charley out of this.
You don't think he'd be helpful?
Go ask him, why don't you ? Ask him yourself.
Maybe I will one of these days.
Listen Nolan
What are you down here for to see we don't make off with any of Mister Friendly's precious cargo?
Leave her alone, you fiend!
Fiend is it! You will not be so fortunate. Your existence will cease within moments. No one wishes to see a man dance... And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come.
If I could get my hands on you...
..Oh, You could do nothing! I can save you much pain.
Leave her alone, I tell you!
We sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery. Let's turn back.
No. It's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.
But does it have to be in a cemetery?
You wouldn't understand. Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
But there're so many wonderful things to write about, Bob.
Sure there are--and I've tried them all. Plays, love stories, westerns, dog stories. Huh, now there was a good one, that dog story all about--
But horror stories! Why all the time horror stories?
Your puritan upbringing holds you back from my monsters, but it certainly doesn't hurt your art of kissing.
That's life. My kisses are alive.
All of my books are based on fact, or legend. Thats perhaps why they're more interesting and sell in the top spots.
Well, fact or not, I don't see how we're going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight. I can't see a thing! Let's turn back.
I'm getting the jitters! Let's turn back!
Well we certainly can't stay here. C'mon.
Where?
In there.
It frightens me.
Silly, there's nothing in there to be afraid of.
Then..then what's that music?
That's what I want to find out. We have to get help.
What help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night?
Something's making that music.
I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
All right. Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
Not dead? In a cemetery?
I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
Could it be some kind of college initiation?
It's an initiation all right, but not of a college as you and I know them. Nothing alive looks like that!
Can't we get out of here?
I'm not sure...
What do you mean?
Look!
I'm so frightened.
You've got a right to be. We're trapped by a bunch of fiends.
Those creatures..!
Don't let them hear you.
What can we do?
Easy Shirley, Easy! Panic won't do us any good! Let me think. We've got to stall for time.
I'm afraid I'll faint.
The ropes are coming loose.
Be careful!
I am--It's our only chance.
Nothing is worth your life.
My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.
I'm frightened. I'm so frightened.
Hold on just a little longer, Shirley.
Be careful, oh please be careful. We'll never get out of here alive, I know it. I just feel it.
You do?
Yes I feel it in my bones.
You're talking nonsense.
Oh, no I'm not. These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b>
I should hope not. I hate you!
That sudden?
Yes, that sudden. If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this. It's all your fault.
I've got the ropes loose now. I've got my hands free. Be careful--Don't change your expression too much. They must not catch on.
What can we do against them?
I don't know, yet. We'll just have to watch our chance. When it comes I'll know what to do--I hope I'll know what to do.
I still don't know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you.
All right. Put it on heavy.
My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this. At least <i>he's</i> got brains.
<i>Him!</i> I'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on.
I love you Bob. I really do. Forgive me?
There's nothing to forgive. It was all a dream.
You love me then?
But they are not yet one of us.
A situation easily remedied.
...And what is this?
A symbol, Master.
What kind of symbol?
She came to us on the Day of the Dead.
El Dia De Los Muertos...A celebration in her country.
She was?
As I said, a worshipper of snakes, and of smoke, and flames.
Oh, yes, a religion of sorts.
She pleases me. Permit her to live in the World of the Snakes.
Now, I will talk...to The Wolf Man...and The Mummy.
Yes, yes yes I know all that.
At the first sight of the morning sun's rays, we must be gone.
I suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon.
It would seem so, Master
She is to be <b>mine!</b> It is so spoken!
Well?
Ahh, she will be yours.
When!?
At your discretion...But first, I desire more entertainment.
The moon is almost gone!
Ahh, there is yet time.
At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
I know the laws of the night. I state there is still time for yet another.
I would have time for my own pleasures!
Your own pleasure comes only after mine, when I desire it. I am the Sole Ruler of the Dark World. There is no one to challenge my authority here. My word is the law--all powerful. <b>No one</b> is to challenge that authority, <b>no one!</b>. Is that understood? It is my command.
I understand, Master
Then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of Everlasting Despair. Now are there others?
There are others.
The moon sinks lower into the hills! We must hurry to the finish.
I will decide the conclusion.
You had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session.
Then cancel my order.
The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>
There is yet time. Don't you want your own pleasure?
Oh, if there is only time!
Hahh, there is always time... All in good time...there is <b>always</b> time. You shall have your pleasure. <b>THAT</b>... I <i>decree</i>
The time...is short.
For what!?!
Your pleasures of course!
You mean...!
You may take her now.
Is there time?
You better hope there is.
Thank you, Master! Thank you.
They are live ones?
Yes, Master.
Live ones where only the dead should be?
Have we in some way made you angry, Master?
You know better than that.
We don't know of anything, Master...
Then why do you shake so?
It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you.
Then it is some service you desire of us.
There are one or two which should complement the night's entertainment, Master
Ahh, good. Then I will see them. Dismiss the rest.
Ahh, the curiousity of youth... on the road to ruin! May it ever be so adventurous!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
I have promised both The Wolf Man and The Mummy a reward. It could be that <b>you</b> are that reward.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
No. No! No!
I don't like snakes. I remember the one Cleopatra used. Cute little rascal until it flicked out that red tongue, and those two sharp fangs. You'd never think such a little thing packed such a big wallop.
Aaaaahhnnnhaaaaaannnhhh?
Hurt her? Hell, it killed her!
We had lots of snakes in my ancient Egypt...slimy, slinky things.
Aahhhhnnnaaahahnn. AaaaaahhhhoooWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
When I was alive, they were the things nightmares were made of.
He wants us.
Aaahhnnnahnnnn.
What do you suppose for?
Aaaaannnnnuuunnnuhhhhh?
Did you do something to get us into trouble again?
Aannnnaahhnn.
Did you howl off-key at the moon again?
Aannnnaahhnn.
I could make her another Cleopatra...
Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
That's funny, Adele. How many more times you gonna gimme that one?
Till it's not funny any more. What do you want, Jack?
You know that Super Bowl party? They changed the date. It's on <u>tonight</u>, eight-thirty.
Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?
I said not as a rule.
So why don't you come right out and tell me what you're talking about?
Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth. Out there in the free world.
What's free about it? I'm looking for work.
What happened to Mandrake the Magician?
Emil the Amazing. The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes. How's this sound--
Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that party is today instead of Sunday. About eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now. So you'll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might be doing...
And the one driving the other car?
What're you talking about?
Well, seeing as you have so much luck with cars, Buddy thought it might be better to bring two. He got this guy he says you know from Lompoc, Glenn something.
Glenn Michaels.
Yeah, that's him. Buddy says Glenn thinks you guys are real cool.
Oh, is this Adele?
Yes, it is.
I want to speak with you, please.
Lie face down on the floor.
Yes.
You do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside?
Yes.
You were <i>both</i> in the trunk? Together?
The FBI didn't tell you I was with them?
They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they asked questions.
But you know what I'm talking about, don't you? About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?
I'm getting ready to go out. You can come in if you want, sit down for a minute. Would you like a Diet Coke?
He didn't hurt you or anything, did he?
You mean, did he try to jump me? No, but he was kind of talkative.
You didn't visit him in prison.
He didn't want me to.
Why not?
I don't know. He was different after he was sentenced, looking at thirty years. Said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer.
But you spoke to him on the phone.
He'd call every once in a while.
He called the day he escaped.
He did? I don't remember. Did he say about me? In the trunk?
He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.
Huh. Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks. It's all he's ever done.
Did you know that when you married him?
I'll say one thing for Jack, he was never ugly or mean, or drank too much. He was very considerate, lights on or off, if you know what I mean.
Adele, sooner or later, he's gonna get caught. I'd like to get him before he does something else, makes it worse on himself.
Jack came out of a bank he just robbed in Pasadena, couldn't get his stolen car to start. Battery was dead. He looks over, sees Buddy sitting in a burgundy Bonneville, goes up, offers him a thousand dollars for a jump. Turns out, Buddy was casing the same bank and saw the whole thing. Buddy says, I'll take the thousand, but we're leaving in
Till they got busted.
That wasn't Jack's fault. No, that was on account of Buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to a job <u>before</u> they'd done it instead of after. She called the FBI and they both went down, ended up at Lompoc. I think Buddy felt kinda bad about that.
Ask him his name.
You're good.
Adele? You in there?
I talk to the guy you work for, Emil. He tole me your number and where you live. See, I'm looking for an assistant and would like to speak to you.
Oh. Uh-huh.
You did work for Emil, right?
Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost four years.
You were his what, his box?
You say you perform in the Miami area?
I'm not dressed.
Wait in the hall! I have to get dressed!
I don't know where he is.
Listen, I'm the one help Jack escape from prison. He tole me, I can't find him to see you. So why don't you open this fucking door. Okay? So we can speak.
Go away, or I'll call the police.
It's Richard Ripley.
I bet that's all the hacks they send out. Otherwise nobody's left to mind the store.
Where in the hell are we?
That's the turnpike up there. Glenn's waiting with the other car.
We may as well leave her, we're leaving the car and we gotta leave her some place anyway, what's the difference where?
Jesus Christ, what were you doing in there?
Do we need him?
Wait a minute. Let me have your raincoat. Somebody forgot to bring me clean clothes.
Why you brought Glenn into this, I'll never know.
How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?
I don't know why, but every time he opens his mouth I want to punch him out.
You want to take her to my place and get cleaned up? You come out of the bathroom with your after-shave on and she goes, "Oh, I had you all wrong"?
I want to talk to her again, that's all. See what would happen under, you know, normal circumstances.
I'm just saying she wasn't scared.
You're just jealous it was me in the trunk with her and not you.
I've been dreaming about a hot bath for the last six months. Soak the prison off me.
There's some lilac oil, you want some, a vanilla candle under the sink.
Oh, man.
There's something about a nice hot bath, transforms a person. It's not just about opening up your pores, know what I mean? There's just something about the heat and the wet that's calming you know? Settles me in a way that I really can't articulate.
I know exactly what you mean. It's just a feeling. You know, I could go for some wine tonight.
There's a store around the corner, I'll be right back.
They pass this picture around you can go anywhere you want, nobody'll know you.
I wasn't feeling my best that day. I'd just drawn thirty to life.
Paper says there's ten grand each on you, Chino and Lulu.
Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
Just that she got away.
Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn?
Think this old guy is her boyfriend? It's the only picture she carries.
Longer we hang around down here, Jack, better chance there is either Glenn's gonna fuck up the whole score, or we gonna get busted, or both.
What?!
Chino's gonna wanna talk to me.
He's running for his life, he doesn't give a shit about you.
He's gotta know by now that I gave him up back at Glades. He does, he's gonna try to find me. Maybe go see Adele, see what she knows.
Jack?
We were talking one time, drinking rum. I may've mentioned Adele, how she worked for a magician. Chino got interested. He's like, Yeah? How does he saw the woman in half? He wanted to meet her. Or get a look at her if she ever came to visit.
So call her up. Tell her don't talk to any Cubans.
Her phone's probably tapped.
And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel.
Nice disguise.
I'm a tourist.
You at least bring the gun?
There. You see the guy sitting on the porch? The old ladies and one guy? You know they'll have a couple more in a car somewhere.
I guess Adele's in good hands.
Sure looks that way.
Let's go to Detroit.
First thing we do, we get to Detroit, we find Glenn, then we find a window to throw him out of.
I been thinkin', if I was Glenn, I was up there to take down the Ripper, where would I go?
Well, first off, if you were Glenn, you wouldn't be thinking.
Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal from Lompoc?
Snoopy. Christ, I thought he'd be brain dead by now.
They know where I live, I guess they know what I drive, so maybe we should pick up another car on the way.
"Fight over tuna casserole may have spurred slaying." Seems this woman's live-in boyfriend, seventy years old, complained about her tuna noodle casserole and she shot him in the face with a twelve-gauge. Police found noodles in the woman's hair and think the guy dumped the casserole dish on her before she shot him. They'd been together ten years.
Whatta you think?
I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner.
Is that Snoopy? In the purple doo rag?
Outside of that.
Doesn't say what she's doing up here, but I don't think it has anything to do with us.
I think she's after Glenn. The girl still with you?
They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less you pay for it.
You tell your sister about it?
Just hung up.
How long you talk to her?
Two hours.
How long were you with the girl?
Forty-five minutes.
You didn't tell your sister about Ripley, did you? 'Cause I don't wanna go through that again.
Forget about my sister. If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up.
Now that's a really big house.
Jesus, look at that wall. Place almost looks like a prison.
No doubt the man's got some big-ass security system.
Time comes, we knock on the door. See if he wants to talk about old times. Go in the easy way.
Yeah? You think he'll let us in, we got Snoopy and the muscle-bound asshole with us?
Who says anybody's gonna be with us? I say we go to the fights tomorrow, find out what the Snoop's big plan is, then go in ahead of those guys -- <u>alone</u>.
Let Glenn deal with the Snoop, while we're off livin' the good life.
Tell me something, Buddy. You know anyone who's actually done one last big score and gone to live the good life? Cause it occurred to me that everyone <u>talks</u> about doing it, but I don't know anyone who's actually gone and <u>done</u> it. Do you?
I mean, they don't know for sure he's dead. Look, there's always a chance we'll walk out've there with nothing. I say let fate decide.
Let fate decide? What're you, the fuckin' Dali Lama now?
My sister believes in fate, but not hell. That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to pray I don't fuck up. Whatta you think, you think there's a hell, Jack?
Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional Institution and I'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it.
They put a gun on you, you'll go back.
Listen, I gotta get some better shoes, few other things before tomorrow. Why don't you drop me off at the Ren Cen, we'll hook up later?
It took you, what, seven hours to buy a pair of shoes?
And she saw you?
Yes, she did.
So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal?
You know how I felt about her.
Did you give her a jump? If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at.
It wasn't about getting laid. I just wanted to know what might've happened if things were different.
You find out?
So what's that mean? That you're disappointed by what you found or you're sorry you robbed all those banks?
They want to go tonight, before Glenn gets in any trouble, opens his big mouth.
You know they gonna set us up.
I get that feeling, yeah.
I'll make you a deal. Get out of here. Right now. I'll do the job with the Snoop, meet you wherever you want and give you half.
Half for doing what?
Getting me out of Glades for starters.
There's still time, take me up on my offer.
You ever wear one of these?
I don't ski.
They found the safe.
You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?
They look like plain old rocks.
Come <i>on</i>.
Shit.
What?
They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they.
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
And then they'll kill 'em.
We made it, didn't we?
I'm going back inside.
No, you dump the van, meet me at the airport. I'll take one of Ripley's cars.
Jack --
Hello, Daniel.
I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.
That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now. Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
Isn't that my report you're holding onto?
Yes, but I want to hear you tell it. Starting with when you tried to grab the wheel -- where was this?
There's a couple of points I keep wondering about have to do with the two guys that grabbed you. Buddy is it? And this fella Jack Foley. I swear the man must've robbed two hundred banks in his time.
Really? Huh. He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed.
You talked to him?
In the trunk, yeah?
What'd you talk about?
Oh... different things, prison, movies.
This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
It was an unusual experience.
Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman, the one you were seeing, it turns out the same time he was doing banks. You recall that?
When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks.
Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe he did, and I told you. So you had to at least suspect him.
And what happened to Carl?
The time came, you shot him. But you didn't shoot Foley or the guy with him. They're unarmed, you had a shotgun and you let them throw you in the trunk. Okay, now you got your Sig in your hand. You say in the report you couldn't turn around, he had you pinned down. But when the trunk opened, how come you didn't cap
Is that what you would've done?
You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too.
Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud? Go after crooked bookkeepers.
Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations.
Have you ever shot a man? How many times have you been primary through the door?
I have to qualify, is that it?
We'll talk another time, Karen. All right? I'd like to know why Foley put you in that second car when he didn't need you any more.
You'll have to ask him.
Shut up.
Karen. Where are you? I been trying to get a hold of you.
Daniel. Listen --
Where are you? I been trying to reach you.
I'm at Adele Delisi's.
What-- we already talked to her. That's a dead end.
Yeah, I know. I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me?
There was a Buddy Bragg at Lompoc around the same time Foley was there. We got an address for him at the Adams Hotel in Hallandale. I want you to go there, see if you can get the manager to i.d. him as the other guy. If he does, you call me right away...
All right, but...
But don't you <u>do</u> anything. You just have a seat, wait for me to get there.
Sure, Daniel.
Now. What is it you wanted to tell me?
Oh, I was just wondering, if I were to bring in Chirino, would you put me on the task force?
What? Is that what you're calling me about?
Yes or no, Daniel. If I get him, will you let me go after Foley?
Yeah, sure, Karen. You bring in Chirino, you can be on the task force.
That's all I wanted to know.
You get the key?
You're primary, you're secondary, you're point man.
You're gonna use a ram?
Yeah, why?
Take the radio, stay down here in the lobby, watch the elevator.
What? Daniel, I wanna go upstairs.
Now you see Foley and this guy Bragg come in behind us, whatta you do?
Call and tell you.
Leave it where it is.
Wait. You not Adele?
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest. Put the gun on the table. I mean, now.
Put it down or I'll shoot.
You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
What do you want to bet?
I could walk out of here.
You can live or die, it's up to you.
Oh, is that right? You going to shoot me? Nice girl like you? I don't think so.
Daniel Burdon, please. Karen Sisco.
You excited?
I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.
Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
Why you think is today?
You want, I tole you you can come. You all right, Foley. I like you.
You see what they doing, those posts out there? Putting up another fence, five metres on the other side of the one that's there. We wait until Super Bowl Sunday, they could have the second fence built and we have to dig another nine, ten days. So we going soon as it's dark. You want -- I mean it -- you can still come.
Ironic, isn't it?
How are you, Raymond?
Quite a mess.
Yeah. And I thought everyone liked Eddie.
Who?
Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation.
What is it with crack and transsexuals?
Yeah, Eddie was a real character. Had these girls cooked the rocks he called the Rockettes.
Yeah. I saw one of 'em outside.
Other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together. You gonna tell me why you're comin' to me instead of the FBI?
I report to the FBI, first thing they're gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee.
You know, I'm not in homicide any more.
No, I didn't know that.
Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and property now, also sex crimes and child abuse.
Detroit, you must be pretty busy.
Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions are big, too.
Listen, Raymond, a year ago, DEA had this guy Glenn Michaels on possession with intent but couldn't make it stick. In his statement, Glenn said he went up to Detroit to visit a friend and look into job opportunities -- if you can believe that.
Who was the friend?
Guy named Maurice Miller, also known as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.
Christ, I know Snoopy Miller. He's a fuckin' wackjob thinks he's Sugar Ray Leonard. Hangs out with a couple other Grade-A nutcases over on the West side.
I'll need a last known address.
That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.
Hello?
We're a few minutes away. Just sit tight, stay outta the house till we get there, understand?
Karen, I told you not to--
Sign says "Shut the fuck up." Or can't you guys read?
There a problem, Foley?
Yeah, I got a problem. This is the dumbest fucking shakedown in the history of dump shakedowns. Three hundred bucks for a pillow?
How much for your company at chow?
Company, shit. I watch the man's back.
I bet. How much?
This doesn't concern you, Foley. Why don't you go on out to the yard, have yourself a smoke?
Himey here's a pro-toh-jay of mine. He's ranked number thirty-two in the federal prison system.
Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower.
It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper. Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh?
Like being back in the yard, huh?
Just like it. Nobody backing down. You back down, you pussy. Tell me what you and Buddy doing up here in the cold?
Look, Snoop, I don't know what Glenn promised you or what you think you're gonna get, but the deal is me and Buddy get half of whatever we take from Ripley, understand? How you and Glenn cut up the rest is up to you.
Let's go outside and talk.
What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.
Who's sitting here?
Reggie, push off and hit, man. Push him off.
We're leaving.
The fuck you talking about?
Look, what you worried about Glenn for? What's he know?
Soon as we leave here. Stop home and pick up what we need and go do it.
Give me a minute, talk to Buddy.
You got two minutes, that's all. Make up your mind.
That what they're wearing these days to break and enter?
Break and enter, shit. Take it and git, how it's done. Don't waste any time. That's how you do it.
So you've done this before, huh?
Takes the TV, the VCR, some other shit and leaves his wallet on the floor.
That's a wonderful story, Snoop. I'm very excited about tonight.
You know how to use one a these?
Good luck, Richard.
Jack, you don't use a gun, do you?
Not until recently.
Nervous?
A little.
This kind of setup, you don't have any idea what the fuck you're doing -- do you?
Why you're just a girl. What do you do for a living you pack a shotgun?
You comfy?
If I could have a little more room.
There isn't any. All this shit you got in here. What is all this stuff anyway? Handcuffs, chains... what's this can?
For your breath. You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth.
Where's your gun, your pistol?
Boy, it stunk in there.
I believe it. You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.
Yeah, went real nice with that twelve gauge, too. Tell me, why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall?
The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.
Guys like me, huh. Well, listen, even though I've been celibate lately, I'm not gonna force myself on you. I've never done that in my life.
You wouldn't have time anyway. We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.
If they get set up in time, which I doubt. And even if they do they'll be looking for a buncha little Latin fellas, not a big black guy driving a Ford.
Who, Buddy? Yeah. He's a good guy. Back when we jailed together, he'd call his sister every week without fail. She's a born-again Christian, does bookkeeping for a televangelist. Buddy calls her up, confesses his sins, tells her about whatever bank he happened to rob.
Buddy. That's his given name?
So, what's <u>your</u> name? It'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway.
Jack Foley. You've probably heard of me.
Why, are you famous?
Time I was convicted in California? FBI told me I'd robbed more banks than anyone in the computer.
How many was that?
Tell you the truth, I don't know. I started when I was eighteen, driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner, Gus. They go into a bank this one time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. All three of us ended up in Angola.
That's funny.
I thought so, too.
It was me, I woulda left ol' Gus on the floor.
I believe you would have. Another fall, I did seven years at Lompoc. And I don't mean the place next door where some of Nixon's people went.
I know the difference. You were in Lompoc USP, the federal penitentiary. I've delivered people there. So basically you've spent half your life in prison.
Basically. Yeah. If I go back now, I do a full thirty years, no time off. Can you imagine looking at that?
You don't seem all that scared.
Of course I am.
You don't act like it.
What do you want me to do? Scream? I don't think it would help much. I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.
You were married? All those falls, I'm surprised you had time.
It was just a year, give or take a few days. I mean, it's not like we didn't get along or anything. We had fun, we just didn't have that... that thing, you know? That spark, you know what I mean? You gotta have that.
Uh-huh.
We still talk, though.
You know, this isn't gonna end well, these things never do.
Yeah, well, if it turns out I get shot like a dog, it'll be in the street, not off a goddamn fence.
Oh, you mean of Bonnie and Clyde? Hm. You ever see pictures of him, the way he wore his hat? You could tell he had that don't-give-a-shit air about him.
I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers. Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?
Is that right?
They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving. Bonnie was eating a sandwich.
You're full of interesting facts, aren't you?
That part in the movie where they get shot? Warren Beatty and... I can't think of her name.
Faye Dunaway.
Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV...
<i>Network</i>. Yeah, she was good.
And the guy saying he wasn't gonna take any more shit from anybody...
Peter Finch.
Yeah, right. Anyway, that scene where Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get shot? I remember thinking at the time it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you have to.
Bleeding on a country road.
You're sure easy to talk to. I wonder -- say we met under different circumstances and got to talking, say you were in a bar and I came up to you -- I wonder what would happen.
Nothing.
I mean if you didn't know who I was.
You'd probably tell me.
I'm just saying I think if we met under different circumstances...
Another one Faye Dunaway was in I liked, <i>Three Days of the Condor</i>.
With Robert Redford, when he was young.
I never thought it made sense, though, the way they got together so quick.
Really.
I mean, romantically.
Get your hands up and turn around. <u>Now</u>.
You know who this is?
How'd you get this number?
Who was it answered the phone?
None of your business.
I'm just worried maybe I'm not old enough for you.
That's my dad.
Really. He has a cop's face.
How do you know? Wait-- you have my wallet.
And your gun.
Think I could have them back?
How do we do that?
Let's see. You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off.
There's a guy here on the task force right now. Maybe I should put him on the phone, let you two work it out.
You won't do that.
Why not?
My dad's retired. He was a Private Investigator. Forty years. I used to work for him.
I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.
Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?
Why? You think he might tell you where I am?
Unless you wanna tell me.
He's dead. He did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital, I think trying to make up for all the good times he'd missed. That's not gonna be me.
One last score, that the idea? Move to some island.
I'm partial to mountains myself. But if you like islands, we'll make it an island.
Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island?
It takes hours to get a drink around here. There's only one waitress.
I can go to the bar.
Don't leave me.
Those guys bother you?
You like bourbon?
Love it.
Well, we got that out of the way. Tell me, Celeste. What do you do for a living?
I'm a sales rep. I came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because I'm a girl.
Is that how you think of yourself?
What, as a sales rep?
A girl.
I don't have a problem with it.
I like your hair. And that suit.
I had one just like it -- well, it was the same idea, but I had to get rid of it.
You did?
It smelled.
Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?
No. What do you do for a living, Gary?
Not yet. Don't say anything yet. Okay?
I don't think it works if we're somebody else. You know what I mean? Gary and Celeste, Jesus, what do they know about anything?
It's your game. I've never played this before.
It's not a game. Something you play.
Well, does it make sense to you?
It doesn't have to, it's something that happens. It's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition. Like you both know something. But then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but
Oh, God...
I called your room from downstairs.
If I had answered, what were you gonna say?
Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.
If I remembered you. I came looking for you. I would've said sure, let's do it. But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team. Why would you trust me?
You like taking risks.
You really wear that suit.
Remember how talkative you were? In the trunk? Adele said you do that when you're nervous.
She did, huh.
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
I might've smelled like a sewer, but you could tell I was a gentleman. They say John Dillinger was a pretty nice guy.
I hear he didn't mean to. The cop fell as Dillinger was aiming at his leg and got him through the heart.
You believe that?
What were you gonna do with me?
I don't know. I hadn't worked that part out yet. All I knew was that I liked you, and I didn't want to leave you there, never see you again.
I wasn't sure you caught that.
I couldn't believe it. I was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet. Like if we could take a time-out...
You know I saw you on the street.
Where?
You were going to see her?
To warn her about Chino.
So she did help you?
I don't think we should get into that.
No, you're right. Or Buddy. I won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in Detroit. Or if you've run into Glenn Michaels yet.
You coming back?
I want you to know something. I wasn't looking for just a fuck, if that's what you're thinking.
Why are you mad?
Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill. Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.
What about <i>my</i> motive? Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal. You think I will?
You're not dumb.
You getting serious on me now?
I'm trying not to. I just wanna know what's gonna happen.
Come on, Jack -- don't.
Pretend I'm somebody else.
If you don't, one of those guys will.
What're you now, a desperado? Put the guns down.
I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't shoot you.
You just did, for Christ sake.
He got three years and fined fifty million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking check. Like that, fifty mil, signed his name. Whoa-- little help here!
Who you talkin' to, Studs? Me, or Buddy. I can't tell, you got those shades on.
You guys-- come on-- this is too heavy!
I guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights.
Detroit. Snoopy Miller told me uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash.
Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs? They look like plain old rocks.
So. What's your point?
My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with.
You think he's lying?
Oh, hey, Studs? We thought you were somebody else.
Studs. Man, I haven't heard that since Lompoc. What's going on?
Take your sunglasses off.
I see better with them on.
Wait in the car.
You're in civilization now, man, ease up.
I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that? Take her with you and put her in back.
In the trunk?
Weren't you expecting us?
She <i>knew</i> me from some bullshit dope bust. She drove me to court. Twice. You know what she said, we're in the car on the turnpike? "I never forget anybody I've cuffed and shackled."
What happened to your shades? Someone finally step on 'em?
Whose blood you got all over you?
I thought you guys were busted.
Some people are going out of here. What if I told you where and when?
How many?
I expect you to look out for me, Pup, let me run off work details.
Okay. How many going out?
I hear six.
When?
Looks like tonight.
You know who they are?
You don't wanna be standing there, the hacks start asking questions you don't wanna answer.
Sounds high, doesn't it?
You're smart, Ripley, you'll tell this guy to fuck off.
Really? Well, I uhhh...
Thanks for your help.
Tell me something. What's it like, walk in a bank with a gun, stick it up?
I don't know. I never used a gun.
Really?
You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way.
You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.
No? Where do you keep it, Dick? I'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about.
I know what you're talking about.
You're the one with balls, Dick, say something like that to someone like Glenn. Or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute.
Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do <u>you</u> believe Glenn?
Of course not.
Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.
Doesn't have to figure out shit. You <u>told</u> him you keep 'em at your house.
Tell me something, Jack, how much longer you in here?
Twenty-two months, three days, two hours. Why?
It's a little late for me.
Hey, Jack? Bullshit. I didn't make my first million until I was forty- two. Forty-two. You really <u>want</u> to change, it's never too late.
I don't know. I'm not exactly the nine-to-five type.
Who is? But then you gotta look at a job as more than just work. You gotta look at it as peace of mind. As <i>security</i>, you know what I mean? I got offices in Detroit, Miami, Boston, take your pick.
My ex-wife's in Miami. It's nice down there.
No need to decide now. Be like the fish. Let whatever happens happen.
The fish?
Yeah, fish live in the present. They don't dwell on yesterday and they don't worry about tomorrow. Even when a big fish attacks a little fish, there's no neurosis involved. No guilt afterward. No whining on some fish-shrink's couch. They just do it. They accept.
I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before.
The fish saved my life. Two years ago, I found out I had high blood pressure. So my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing out.
And the guy sent you a bill for this?
It works. You should try it sometime.
I still haven't made up my mind yet.
What's to think about?
You goin' right back to work?
Today, I'm offering you a lousy job at a lousy wage. You think you're better than that? Fine. Show me. Show me that you're really willing to change and we'll talk about something better. A lot better. But first, Jack, you gotta earn it.
How, Dick? The way <u>you</u> earned it? By marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her? What is this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit? Back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks. You were a goddamn dumpling. Maurice and a dozen other guys
Gentlemen. I think we've calmed down now. Haven't we, Jack?
Foley? That you?
How are you, Richard?
Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing here? What's going on? Who's upstairs?
Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.
Have they got Midge up there?
What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night?
We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her. She told him I was down in Florida.
What do you want from me, Jack? Name it. You want money?
You gonna write me a check?
Good God... they're shooting Midge!
I can't believe you're still angry with me, Jack, after all this time.
Dumbfuck Glenn was right, there's about five million worth in there, wouldn't you say, Richard?
I were you, I'd get up and run.
I'm not leaving Midge.
Don't be an asshole, Richard. They're gonna kill you.
<i>Hejira?</i> What kinda name is that?
Islamic.
What's it mean, "No Hair"?
The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed from Mecca in 622.
The flight?
The brothers in Leavenworth gave me the name.
You were at Leavenworth, huh?
For a time.
Meaning?
Meaning time came, I left.
You busted out?
I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place.
And how long was it before they caught up with you?
That time?
There were others.
Yeah. That was the ninth.
The <u>ninth</u>?
Ten, you count the prison hospital in Ohio I walked away from.
You must be some kinda walker, Henry.
Hejira.
And so now you're off to Glades.
Apparently, yeah. I was supposed to leave last night with the lady marshal, but for some reason she wanted to wait.
She did, huh.
Cheaper I guess, take us both down in one van.
Yeah, could be. Or maybe she thought we'd have a lot to talk about.
Like what?
I'll send it to you at Glades.
I got a big score lined up up north. They wouldn't even know about it, it wasn't for me. I could do it right now myself, except it's so fucking cold up there in January--
You don't remember me, do you?
It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking. I was never out there.
But you're sure we've met, huh?
Do we have a gun in the car?
I remember you now. Shit.
Look, I can understand if you and Foley are close.
We're not. I'm helping him, yeah--
Take the next exit.
What am I supposed to do <u>now</u>?
Glenn, take the exit.
Glenn, are you trying to steal this car?
Jesus, I don't believe it.
I mean I'm not stealing the fucking car.
You're not?
I already stole it. Last week or whenever it was, in West Palm. I can't be stealing it again, can I?
The two guys you were with -- that one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it? I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him.
Glenn, I know your life history, who your friends are, where you've been and now, it looks like, where you're going. Put your hands on the wheel.
You're gonna bust me for picking up a car?
For the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and conspiring to do whatever you came here for.
Listen, these guys, they're gonna be out here any minute looking for me. They're fucking animals.
What's going on, Glenn?
Nothing. I just wanna get the fuck outta here.
But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they're into shit I can't handle.
Ripley? You mean the wall street guy?
Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills. Now, I don't give a shit what they do.
And is Foley a part of this?
He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.
Why's that?
Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.
Gee, I wonder why not.
I'm freezing my ass off.
You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up.
Really?
But listen, Glenn. If you're lying to me...
I know, you'll find me. Jesus, I believe it. I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am.
Snoopy. Glenn Michaels.
Listen, Snoopy, I'm on my way up to Detroit and need a place to crash.
You crazy, come up <u>here</u>? It's fuckin one degree outside.
I wanna talk to you about a job.
Uh-huh.
I can't really go into it right now. I'll just tell you it's someone big.
Some<u>one</u>? Gimme a hint.
It's a guy you know.
Gimme another hint.
You there?
Watch the road, boy. I like this Town Car. We can cruise the man's neighbourhood without getting the police or private security people on our ass.
Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they won't think anything of it.
You sure Foley and his pal aren't coming up here, do this themself?
So you still haven't said, how you wanna do it?
I'll show you, soon as I get one more guy I'm gonna need, Moselle's brother, Kenneth. Along with White Boy there.
Wait a minute. I'm letting <i>you</i> in on this, not all your friends.
Thing I'm worried about is you.
Me?
Yeah. If you can step up and actually do it. Understand? 'Stead of just talking the talk.
Can I do what?
Walk in a house with me, do this cross- dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to been dealin' on his own.
What-- when?
Right now, son.
I don't have to prove shit to you. The Ripley job is <i>my</i> job. You're either in or you're not. You wanna pop some crack dealer pissed you off, that's your problem, not mine.
Look, Glenn, I know you cool, but you don't have to give me no tone of voice, okay? You don't like what I'm saying, you can get out anywhere along here you want.
I think you're forgetting, this is my car. I drove it up here.
That was some shit, huh?
Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
It's all right with you, I'll just hang in the car.
No. You gonna stay close to me from now on. So you don't disappear on me.
Hi, Ray.
You look great. Your dad taking good care of you?
How's it going?
Foley? Oh. No, it was one of the Cubans. Linares.
Oh...
You're a fighter?
How you know that?
I can tell.
What'd you fight, middleweight?
Light to super-middleweight, as my body developed. You go about what, bantam?
Flyweight.
You know your divisions. You like the fights? Like the rough stuff? Yeah, I bet you do. Like to get down and tussle a little bit? Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle. I say to her, "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you." And I give Tuffy what
You're not my type.
Don't matter. I let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants.
What's wrong with you?
Moselle Miller?
What do you want?
I'm looking for Maurice.
That's not Maurice?
You like to sit down?
I'm looking for a friend of mine I think Maurice knows.
You not with probation, one of those?
No.
You a lawyer?
Glenn? No, I don't know any Glenn.
He said he stayed here last November.
Here? In this house?
He said he stayed with Maurice.
Well, <i>he</i> ain't even here that much. I like to know where he goes, but at the same time I don't <i>want</i> to know, you understand?
Your dog was killed?
Got run over by a car.
Was a she, name Tuffy.
Where do you think I might find Maurice?
I don't know -- the gym, the fights. I <i>know</i> he don't miss the fights. Having some tomorrow night at the State Theater. He use to take me.
You fit another Chanel suit in here?
It's beautiful.
It's a --
Thanks, Dad.
Happy birthday, kid. You want another Coke?
Can't. I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.
Which one is that? The ATF guy?
He was. Ray's with the F.B.I. now, he switched over.
He's still married though, huh?
Technically. They're separated.
Oh, he's moved out?
He's about to.
Then they're not separated, are they?
Can we change the subject?
What're you doing at Glades?
Serving process, a Summons and Complaint. Some con doing mandatory life doesn't like macaroni and cheese. He files suit, says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil rights.
You know you can always step in, work with me full-time as one of my investigators.
No thanks.
You used to like it.
Dad...
You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced. Why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife? That's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em.
I really gotta go.
We don't get to talk much any more.
How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?
You were talking in your sleep.
What'd I say?
"Hey, yourself."
What are you thinking about?
The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.
He doesn't even look like that.
No?
Ray's with the F.B.I. Task Force, working on the prison break.
Was it Foley?
Hello? Yeah, she is. Just a minute. For you.
Remember, pay attention to how she talks about Foley, her tone. Do it right, she'll tell you things she wouldn't tell Burdon. Tell her you think he's a nice guy. No, first tell her about being in the trunk with him, in the dark for half an hour, and see how she takes it. If she's in on it, what does she get for
He's pretty laid back, confident.
He remind you of that guy, Tillman?
Not at all.
But you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again.
I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles.
Maybe. But you're also curious about the man. Twice last night you asked your married boyfriend Nicolet about him. You were concerned, but you didn't want to show it.
My married boyfriend - setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity. I couldn't believe it.
You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley. You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.
Foley <i>kid</i>napped me.
He waved to you?
I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did.
You wave back?
I didn't have time.
Buddy's sister Regina Mary Bragg got two calls from Buddy up in Detroit this morning, called Burdon. She's also the one gave Burdon Buddy's address.
So?
So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.
He doesn't seem to hold a grudge. What <i>I</i> want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long? Any thoughts on that one?
You gonna go get him?
It's possible. Why?
I was just thinking... you could have a nice time with him on the plane -- like picking up where your interlude, or whatever you call it, left off. And then throw him in the can.
He knew what he was doing. Nobody forced him to rob banks.
Not yet. Where's Mr. Ripley?
I told you, he isn't here.
Out for the evening?
He's in Florida. Palm Beach.
You here all by yourself?
Where's Ripley's safe at, he keep his valuables in.
I don't have any idea.
How do I look, mama?
A'ight, this time we gotta get the motherfuckin' trajectory right... Okay, on three: One... Two...
I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Sisco.
In case no one knows what he does. Tell me, Ray, you ever wear one says, "Undercover"?
Yeah, someone spotted two of 'em in this hobo camp out by the airport, called the number--
Did you pay the guy the reward?
...She fixes him pork chops and rice, the next thing you know they're making love on the sofa. She says he was very gentle.
I spoke to her. The guy told her he missed his little girl and she felt sorry for him.
The woman also said he stole her husband's gun, a twenty-two pistol, and some of his clothes.
Thank you...
Not so fast, Dick. Starting now, there's gonna be an across the board cost a living increase.
What?
Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.
I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street. But then, I could be wrong...
That Bausch & Lomb Saline shit you asked for is gonna be eighty bucks.
Well, I need that...
Faux goose down.
Excuse me. Snoopy? Did we settle the fish thing?
Well, if it isn't the Ripper hisself.
Are those <i>my</i> suits?
Midge.
Forget about her. Tell me where the money's at.
Foley's got it.
We have a problem here?
White Boy, how much is the reward on the man again?
Ten gees.
I think he must've fell in.
I found a rubber.
...the fuck is this...
You good-lookin' sumbitch...don't you EVER die!
That's your line for tonight, ya know.
What, good-lookin' sumbitch?
Are you sure they're here?
What is it with Red? I've never seen him this way.
Do you have trouble with your boobs in the uniform?
You mean hiding them?
We'll ask Evelyn. Evelyn? Evelyn!
Now listen, it's hands off Billy. I mean, you can put your hands on him if you want to, but then my hands will break yours.
He was that good?
I wish she could forget him.
He, I'm R-Red. Red S-Strange.
Red...Strange?
You know the football player, Red G- Grange? Well the guys called me R-Red, cause you know, I'm red...and they thought I was strange, so, you know, Red G-Grange, Red Str-Strange.
But...they called you Strange? Because of Red Grange? I don't get it. Was Red Grange strange?
Do you always stutter?
Only when I'm n-n-n-
Nervous?
On loan from Colonel Doolittle, is it?
That's me, Sir.
Good on you, then, Rafe McCawley. We'll get you situated in some quarters, and then introduce you to the equipment you'll be flying.
If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes.
Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
You're Walker, right?
Yes Sir.
That was a nice little stunt you pulled, buzzing the base.
You liked that?
Oh yeah. I liked it so much I'm cutting you out of the squadron.
Sir?
I don't buy that hot dog shit. So you and your buddies are gonna transfer your planes up to Haleiwa.
Hale-what?
You'll love it. No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.
Sir, I --
Too late for apologies, Walker.
Hey. You. Mr. Coma.
Where's that lizard?
What lizard?
The one that slept in my mouth last night.
Yeah.
Rafe's girl, Evelyn?
Ever hear of mai-tai's? Comes in a big...pot. Like...like...
A m-missionary?
I th-think I'm gonna like it here.
Shit, he's puking on my feet!
Well, you p-puked on his feet.
They ready, Earl?
Cock-suckin' right I do!! In the gun lockers!
Earl! You said the planes were ready but -- but what?
Danny, I don't like this fuckin' guy.
Who the fuck taught you to fly?
Bandits at 2 o'clock.
It's Germans!
Good shooting, Danny!
Good shooting, Rafe!
Land of the free...
Home of the brave!
Didn't you say test the limits?
How could you do this?
The Colonel helped me work it out.
I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork, I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it?
I'm sorry, Danny, but they're only accepting the best pilots.
Don't make this a joke, Rafe. You're talking about war, and I know what war does to people.
Nah, you go on.
I have to talk to Evelyn. And I want you to meet her.
Didn't you say you told her not to come?
Yeah.
Then why are you looking for her?
You'd always go sit in a plane whenever you were upset.
Upset? Why should I be upset?
Sorry.
Why be sorry? That's what you feel, it's better to come out with it.
I didn't mean it.
Sure you did. So come on. Say what you think.
Waitress! Four beers!
You don't wanna put beer over mai-tai.
We gotta face some facts here.
What facts are those?
I understand how it could happen. I know why any guy would love her. And I can't blame you that it happened. You thought I was dead, she was grieving, you were trying to help her.
I was grieving too.
Yeah, right. Anyway, you didn't know.
So what are you saying?
I'm saying now you do know. So it's time for you to fuck off.
You left her. How's that for a fact?
How come you're not pukin'?
Don't blame her, Rafe. It's not like you're thinking.
Fuck you.
She said I was so much like you. I said, No, I'm not. I'm like I am because of you, but I'm not you, not as good as you. Everybody else saw me as a loser with a big chip on his shoulder. But you saw the better part of me, the part of me that could be like you, and changed me. You
Get me into a plane!
Where are we going?
Auxiliary field at Haleiwa, ten miles north of here.
What's there?
This ain't a little feud, Earl, it's World War Two!
It's tight.
They're all over us!
You hear my okay?
Yeah. So you can call me if you need help.
I got a half a tank. You?
Land of the free.
I'm out of ammo!
Sorry you're gonna die -- cause I'm gonna make it.
Fun today. Like old times.
Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
What do you mean? I'm just doing what we've always done.
No. You're trying to beat me.
We've always tried to beat each other.
Maybe just trying to measure up.
It's shorter than our practice runway.
They'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch. That'll help.
It's not getting any longer.
Broomsticks instead of tail guns.
We'll get separated over the target, but you and I will rendezvous for the run to China. I'm on your wing.
And I'm on yours. Land of the free.
Danny...
I can't make it.
Hey! What is this, the planes all bunched up like that?
The brass is afraid of sabotage. This makes 'em easier to protect -- and easier to service.
What about easier to hit in an air raid?
Who's gonna to that? Japan is four thousand miles away. So you guys just arrived, huh?
Yeah.
Lieutenant... I'm Danny Walker. I'm Rafe McCawley's best friend.
Before Rafe left, he asked me to be the one to tell you, if it happened.
He told me about you. That he had no other friend like you.
Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business, owned their own planes. Real straight, frugal. My father was the town drunk. Went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the Dawn Express came along. Rafe and I were the only ones at the funeral. He took me back to his house, and I never left.
You were more like brothers.
I taught him to drink beer. He taught me how to fly.
He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.
How's everything?
We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet. Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.
That might not have been such a good idea. They're making us fly out of a half-paved airfield. The real punishment is that I won't be back to the barracks till it's too late for dinner or coffee. So I guess it's goodbye for awhile.
I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes. Do you think that's why we're meeting. To help us say goodbye to Rafe?
Sorry.
He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret. Now that's all I have.
Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?
Well...sure.
So beautiful!
And where's the secret base, Sir? The one we t-takeoff from.
C-Colonel, we been p-practicing takeoff's, but I ain't sure we can land on these carriers d-decks.
We won't have the fuel to get back to the carriers; they'll turn and run back to Hawaii the minute we're airborne.
Then wh-where do we land?
Now we have fifteen requests for the Emperor's Palace...and one for Tokyo baseball stadium.
I d-don't think Japs ought'a be allowed to p-play baseball.
I'd like to bomb their Emperor too. But I think that'd just piss 'em off. The idea here, Gentlemen, is not revenge. We're here to prove to them that they're neither invincible nor superior. So let's try this again. Military targets only.
Colonel, to f-fight you need strategy. To have strategy, ya gotta practice. And to practice it, ya gotta play --
No baseball diamonds, Red.
There are some people who think the outside loop is reckless and irresponsible.
How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it?
Don't get smart with me, son.
Never, Sir. I just meant it's dangerous only for the kind of pilot who wants to show off, rather than inspire the other pilots in his unit. And all you've done for me, Sir, working out the transfer, I did it to say thanks. To honor you, Sir. What the French call a "homage."
That's bullshit, son. But it's really good bullshit.
Good luck over there McCawley. I admire your decision.
I heard what you did.
We can explain, Colonel.
Is that the good new, Sir, or --
You're just about the only pilots in the Army with actual combat experience, so you're volunteering for a mission I've been ordered to put together. Do you know what top secret is?
Well sure, Colonel --
In flight school you qualified in single and in multi-engine planes. You'll be flying multi-engines here.
Bombers.
I thought I'd made it clear, I'm not just putting this mission together -- I'm leading it myself.
Listen you guys. I'm the first plane -- then McCawley, Walker, the rest of you. I'll have the shortest run. If I don't make it, you don't go.
Colonel...we're all going. Whether you make it or not.
'Scuse me, 'Mam. All the ship's doctors is golfing, and I couldn't find nobody to look at this.
Our doctor's gone too.
Sorry to trouble you.
How'd you get this?
Boxin'.
Win?
What's your name?
Dorie Miller, 'Mam.
How often you fight like this?
Every other Sunday. I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.
What do you get for winning?
Thank you, 'Mam.
Tell me something, Dorie. A man as big as you -- and smart too, you knew where to come when your ship couldn't help -- do you still have to fight with your fists to get respect?
You take care, Dorie.
Hello, Lieutenant. Good to see you.
Oh, this is Betty.
Danny's not coming?
No, he...got some news today. He'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight.
Whatever you're trying to tell me isn't good, is it. Or it wouldn't be so hard to say.
The only reason it's hard to say is that I keep thinking I don't have the right to say it. But I've got to because it's true. I love you. That must surprise you.
There's one thing I have to say. I'm going away.
We're all going away.
I'm going to the war. The real war. Hitler's taken Europe. The Brits are hanging on by their fingernails, and If they lose, there'll be more people killed than anybody can imagine. And not just there, but here.
But you're in the U.S. Army, how could you --
Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and put me on loan to the R.A.F. They need pilots, and we need experience. I leave tomorrow.
You waited til tonight to tell me?
Evelyn...you know the line -- let's make tonight memorable. What I feel about you makes it impossible for me to say something like that. If I don't come back, I don't want to saddle you with regret and sadness you'll carry the rest of your life.
I don't know if you can choose that, Rafe.
Maybe not. But I need you to know. I love you. And I will come back. I'll find a way. And then we'll get a chance to know if what I felt the first moment I saw you, and every minute since then, is real.
I sent telegrams, I guess the military traffic held them up.
Why were you sitting here, instead of...
I saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just stood there wondering if you knew. You looked...sad, and I had to sit down a minute.
How did you?...
I called my folks, then Colonel Doolittle. The Colonel sent a man to pick me up. They wanted to debrief me. I told the Colonel I needed to see somebody first, and he had a supply flight heading out in an hour. I've done a lot of talking. You haven't said anything.
I'm just...so amazed, so glad to know that you're okay. You are okay, aren't you?
It's been...so different, being so sure you were dead.
It's all right. Danny always said I see things with my emotions instead of my eyes.
It's not your fault, Rafe. The letter I wrote you, they --
Don't worry about that. Guys away from home, lonely, good-hearted women try to cheer them up.
What else can we do?
Rafe --
I need to tell you something. I didn't know what it was to lose somebody, to see death and find how much it scares you. That you haven't lived and loved enough. I didn't understand. Forgive me.
Rafe... No. You forgive me.
Of course I forgive you. I know what you feel for Danny is real. And your choice is your choice.
What?...
They were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along. I wrote Colonel Doolittle, and told him I needed to see you before you go.
It must of been a convincing letter.
Uncharged torpedoes have different balance.
Everything real except the fact that no one is shooting back at us.
If we achieve surprise, they will offer little resistance.
Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept, concerning every potential American target in the Pacific. Include Hawaii -- the clutter will be more confusing that way.
Brilliant, Admiral.
We have achieved surprise, but their carriers are not in port. I don't like this.
We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral.
We have achieved complete surprise! The first wave is returning, the second is attacking now, and we have lost only a few planes. We can launch a third wave, Admiral.
If we launch the third wave and annihilate their fuel depots, we destroy their ability to operate in the Pacific for at least a year!
What if the Japanese did invade?
We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President. Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own broadcast to make the announcement.
Have the planes made it to China?
There've been some complications, Sir. The Chinese didn't receive our request for homing beacons until is was too late to get them set. And the planes had to take off so early they may lack fuel to make the mainland anyway.
So those brave men are flying blind and running out of fuel.
The Chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the Jap patrols do, if any of the planes make it.
Leapin' Jesus!
The struts are loose, the hydraulics are leaking, and the electrical system's shorting out in the cockpit.
Well which of those three ya want fixed?
If ye'd wanted a bloody Cadillac ya should'a stayed in the bloody States!
And if you don't give me a plane that can handle combat, you better start learning to speak German.
Fook ya!
Learn English, then!
I have'na been able ta --
So you join us, Admiral. Some of us thought your education at an American university would make you too weak to fight the Americans.
If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.
You have something to say, Yamamoto?
The Council knows I have opposed fighting the Americans. No matter how great our resolve, they have resources beyond ours. If we must go to war, there is only one way -- deal them a blow from which it will take them years to recover. In that time we can conquer all of the Pacific, and they will have no choice but to ask
You see us as capable of such a blow?
Hello, Lilla!
Quite a bit more rain than usual this year. I hope it doesn't spoil the rhubarb.
What's it going to be, Elizabeth? Seventyfive? Eighty?
I'm not telling.
What's Peggy Sue going to do at your lodge meeting?
Do you believe in all of that?
Well, I like to speculate. This book I'm reading right now, a woman in Colorado says she lived in Ireland a hundred and fifty years ago. Her name was Bridey Murphy- and she gives names and dates and where she lived. She was hypnotized. Big bestseller.
It's gonna rain again. Every time I wash the car, it rains.
That never changes. You know, when you and Grandma are gone, the family's gone. I never see the cousins anymore.
It's your grandma's strudel that's kept this family together.
Grandpa, if you had a chance to do it all again, what would you do?
Let's go.
What does Grandma think you do at your meetings?
I may be an old fool, but I think we can help you.
I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma. Has it ever worked before?
Do you have to wear that hat?
Where were you? You said you'd be back at twelve.
r was worried about you You didn't even call. You're always on my case if I don't call..
How do you like my hair?
But I want you and Scott to understand. Do you think he loves Janet? Maybe he's smashed too many fortune cookies.
Come on Mom. Give him a break. He's missing the reunion because of you. You know he wants to go.
Hey, you're a hip chick. You look like you stepped right out of Life magazine. Any time you want to borrow it again, just ask.
Borrow?! This was my dress. Maybe it's a mistake. What if I'm the only one? I don't even want to go. Everybody's just going to say... Hi.. Where's Crazy Charlie?
Mom, lots of people are separated and divorced.
I feel ridiculous. Maybe I should go home and change.
Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
Carol!
1 just did it for the reunion. I thought it would be fun.
Welcome to the singles scene.
I don't know how you do it. I've never even dated anybody but Charlie.
You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
You should have left here years ago, like I did.
It's not the place. I don't buy that. Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust.
After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious.
Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business. Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently.
Hi, Peggy. God, that Walter Getz can still dance.
Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
The only one?
They're waiting. Come on.
I can't. It's all too much.
Where is it?
Were taking you back to the nurse.
We're going to take you home.
I'll call you Later.
I don't get it.
He is kind of cute, isn't he?
Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.
All right. What's the scoop?
Did you memorize the whole book or only the good parts?
Just what you underlined.
You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair.
I bet Dolores told Charlie.
Okay. But let's have a girls night soon. Maybe a pajama party.
What's the matter?
It's that jerk Walter.
What happened?
After Charlie told Walter that he broke up with you because he wanted to play the field, Walter decided he should do the same thing.
Welcome to the singles' scene.
What a I going to do for the rest of my life? I don't have a boyfriend anymore.
Lucky lady. Hi.
Can you believe I want to marry that dork.
Charlie really has a great voice.
I hear she does more than talk with her mouth.
That's disgusting!
Peggy Sue!
Don't be silly. It's Saturday. Date night!
And we're here on the couch...
We're here on the sofa bed...
Charlie...
Come on Peggy. Say what we rehearsed.
But you love me don't you?
Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
There's something pathetic parked in front of my house.
Come off it, Peggy. And what do you mean your house? This is my house. I paid for it, I'm still paying for it.
I'm still waiting for the mortgage check.
I mailed it to you on Wednesday.
Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here.
You got a Tab?
You don't want them? They're going to make a big comeback any minute. Mark my words, these lamps are going to...
I know. Put Scott through college.
Are you taking Janet to the reunion tonight?
I vant to suck your blood. I also vant to suck your Twinkie.
Charlie! Am I dead?
How do you feel?
Not now, Charlie. I've got a headache. Get used to the word. Roll it around your tongue for a years.
You drive like a maniac!
I call this the staccato.
Not that I'm glad you were sick, but I had a chance to do some thinking last night.
Oh yeah?
You know. About what we said on Tuesday. It makes a lot of sense.
Refresh my memory.
How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
Maybe I blocked it out.
It's not going to be forever. I figure three years is long enough. I can see it the music pans out. And right after graduation we should start seeing other people. Kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married. Know what I mean?
Why wait?
Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?
Want me to drive you home later?
Would you?
Looking good out there.
Thanks.
I noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch. I guess I deserved it. I've been thinking about my three year plan and I think it's unworkable. I must have been delirious.
I thought it had a lot of merit.
In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah...
Rejected, worthless, miserable.
Yeah. Like that.
Where did you get that sweater?
Great, isn't it?
It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world.
Hey! What's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird? And we're going to have fun tonight, right?
Right. I promised my mother.
Is this slow enough for you?
Charlie, how are you?
I'm fine Peggy Sue. And how are you? Are we talking on the phone? Are we pen pals?
Charlie, what do you think of Richard Norvik?
Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?
He's trying.
Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
There isn't a girl in school that can hold a candle to you..
You're pretty charming when you want to be.
Mmm. This is nice. I always loved the way you kiss. I missed you.
Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight. And the tide rushes in.
You really love me, don't you?
You know I do. I even wrote you into my will.
Charlie, let's make love.
What?! You mean sex?! Intercourse? You want to have intercourse! Last weekend you said... What time is it?
A lot's happened since last weekend.
But you're the one who wanted to wait till we got married. And you were right. We should wait.
I probably meant it when I said it. Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?
You know. Your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing!
This is a mistake. We better forget it.
I'm sorry Charlie.
What do you know about classical music?
Nothing.. Selling is selling.
Charlie. About last nights..
Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts.
But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand.
Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?
Because nothing else matters. That's the great thing about love. Every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and I know that I'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end. Cause you're my baby and I love you.
What am I going to do with you?
Charlie. I just had the strangest dream.
What are you doing here?
I want to know what's going on. Dolores told me that you and that scuzzball Michael Fitzsimmons...
I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night. I didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride.
Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did "Book of Love  Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..." I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give
You know I never could stand your sarcasm.
You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this.
And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man.
Charlie,. I've been trying to postpone this. But what's the point? It's over. I don't want to hurt you. This is very hard for me. I'm doing this for both of us. I really want you to be happy.
I will be happy if I have you. I love you.
That won't make any difference. We just can't live together. And you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo Janet.
What are you talking about? Who's Janet?
I just can't trust you anymore.
What about everything I said to you this afternoon...
That's just it. You can always get to me. There's this window in my heart and every time I leave it open, you climb in. Unless I close it now, nothing's ever going to be different!
But what has to be different?
Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish.
What! What about the group and my singing career? What about me?
I'm trying to save you years of frustration... waiting for a big break... no. Waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me.
What're you doing here?
I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to... Good dog, Rusty. Good dog.
Oh. I guess I always liked Rusty better. Could you give me a ride to school?
Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while.
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
How'd you know about that?
I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.
Not terrific enough. What were you doing in that part of town? Who were you with?
What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group.
I'd forgotten how much music meant to you.
That's real big of you.
Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
Not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit. Honest.
Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it.
Just take a look at it.
Does this mean you like me again?
It means I care about you and what happens to you.
Forget it, it'll never work.
What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here?
I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
Let me got! Where are you taking me?
Look. I wanna tell you. I forgive you for everything. I know what you've been going through. You're just scared. I was scared, too, but I'm not anymore.
What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice.
What?
You betrayed me, Charlie. You were never there for me or the children. And now you come and tell me, "Peggy, you're scared." Of course I'm scared. If you knew what I knew you'd be scared shitless.
You're crazy! You're really out of your mind!
Will you take me back to my grandparents?
Oh, Charlie.
I love you.
I think we should get out of here. It's going to rain.
Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?
Peggy! Where're you going? Come back!
I've got to go now.
But I love you. I'll love you forever.
I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll love you for twenty years.
Come back to me.
. Peggy Sue, I love you, and I need you Peggy Sue...
Charlie? Was I dead?
I thought you were...for a while.
You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.
But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you.
I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.
What about Janet?
It couldn't be me. I hardly knew him.
Charlie, I had a strange experience. I went back to high school. And I spent a lot of time with you. And you and Walter and Leon were singing "I Wonder Why".
Oh, God, Dion.
You were terrific. And I kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up.
I'll never give up.
I loved you since the day I met you, and I haven't stopped.
Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell.
Hello, Charlie.
Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. But that's what I like about her. She's not like all the other girls at school.
Charles, in spite of your adolescent infatuation with music, we've always regarded you a a fine young man. We've trusted you with our daughter.
We think this party might cheer her up. Just make sure you know what's expected of you.
What would that be, sir?
Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself.
Did you study for the test?
Carol and I saw you with that creep, Richard, today.
First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.
God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.
Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
Are you for real?
Sorry. These fountain pens are so tricky.
Oh! You did that on purpose! I hate you. Go gargle with razor blades!
I beg your pardon?
Take a long walk on a short pier.
Hey Terry, what is that? Did Peggy make it up? I've never seen that on Bandstand.
Terry, slow down.
Okay.
Terry! Slow down.
There's Peggy with Michael Fitzsimmons.
That commie beatnik? What's she doing with him? Wait'll I tell Charlie.
Fine. ) Grandma, would you teach me how to make strudel?
You know, Peggy Sue, your mother said you had a dream that I died.
I wish she hadn't.
If you believe it, darling, then I believe. Being young can be just as confusing as being old. The things that happened to me fifty years ago are more on my mind than what happened yesterday.
But I'm remembering the future.
Right now you're just browsing through time. Choose the things you'll be proud of. The things that Last.
It was my idea, Grandma. I always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings.
It was Beth's idea.
Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.
Don't get your hopes up.
How come we're your best friends and we had to find out about you and Michael Fitzsimmons from Dolores?
Yeah. He's so cool and mysterious.
Cool it kids. He's free to see other girls, if he wants.
But I always thought that you would marry Charlie, Carol would marry Walter, and I would marry Arthur. We'd all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday. It'll spoil everything if you and Charlie break up. That Michael doesn't look like the barbecue type.
I was impressed with what you said in English class today.
Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature.
You don't?
He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author  fat, violent, drunk...
Maybe you're confusing his life with his work.
The young man leaned back in his chair. No bulls would die today.
What're you doing here anyway?
Coffee and a donut.
I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
This is great reefer.
Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old... Travels well though. You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.
The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy.
What are you shooting for?
Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more JellO for me, Mom.'
Don't you get along with your parents?
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
They care about you. They're just a different generation.
Hey what's with you? I thought you were cool. You rode my bike. You blew some pot. What's your scene Miss Majorette? You gonna marry Mr. Blue Impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life?
A ray of oneness piercing the solitude. Falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh. You'll be a chapter in my memoirs of desire.
Is that one of your poems?
No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one?
I'd love to.
That was quite an evening. Bourgeois, phony, decadent, stupid.
Five more weeks of school. And ten minutes past graduation I'm gone. To freedom.
For everyone.
Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...
Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us.
I can't do that.
Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
But what about the other night? We were like two stars in the same constellation.
Michael, you and I are light years apart. You should go, but not with me.
But we had heat baby. Passion! Fire! We owe it to ourselves to fuse together. At least one more time.
That's a terrific line. You're going to be a wonderful writer.
You think so?
Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it.
It's Charlie!
Ssh. He's great.
I thought I knew everything about him.
I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something.
What?
Young lady, you're drunk!
Just a little. I've had a tough day.
I don't see the humor in this. Go to your room immediately. You're grounded.
Dad, I never knew you had a sense of humor.
Thank you.. I accept your apology with the hope that what went on yesterday will never happen again.
That would be impossible.
You're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits.
If all the kids jumped off a bridge, would you do that too?
Damn that Charlie I
It's not Charlie. It's me.
Peggy, let me ask you something. You're not... expecting are you?
At my age? Don't be silly.
Thank God for that.
Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
All right. But this better be good.
I want to help with the family finances. I want you to buy some stocks. And gold. By 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce. Then you sell.
Do you know how ridiculous you sound? First of all, it's illegal for U.S. citizens to buy gold. And in the second place, the price of gold is regulated by the government.
I think they're going to deregulate it.
That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into.
Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school.
I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room!
Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
Hi, Dad.
For me?
I closed my Christmas club.
Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank.
I wanted to apologize for this morning.
It's hard to believe you're going to be eighteen. Want an eskimo pie? Or a creamsicle? I'd come home from the store and there's little you running up to me. I'd give you a dime and you'd promise never to grow up.
Quiet today?
This morning was good.
The hat business is in trouble.
I, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? You're worried about my business?
Yes.
That's very thoughtful, honey. It's just a slump. Things will pick up.
But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats.
Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.
He'll win.
Ta da! Pantyhose! The death of the garter belt! Of course, once they're manufactured they'll look better than this. What do you think?
That's all well and good, but we don't have the money to manufacture them.
You mean to tell me that you invited this Mr. Fitzsimmons over to talk about investing his money in your cockamamie idea?
How did it go with the pantyhose?
It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now.
Oh no!
Oh, you're both so naive.
Jack, take it easy. She gave blood at school today. Maybe she's just a little lightheaded.
A new car. We can't afford a new car.
Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.
I don't need your charity. I don't need your grandmother's jewelry or your parents money -how could you do that?
Does everybody have to hear?
Jack, I was just trying to help.
Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.
Mom!
I have a note.
How do you feel?
I'm excused.
Why don't you go lie down for a while.
Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home.
Of course, dear. You're home now.
My little baby. Don't try to grow up so fast.
What happened to your hair? You have such a pretty face. Why are you always trying to cover it up?
You're looking pretty chipper this morning.
When did you start drinking coffee?
Oh yeah. Charlie. How am I going to handle him?
What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?.
Sort of.
What about?
Who was that man?
It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
Would you get that, dear?
Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?
What happened to you?
I had a dream that Grandma died.
Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are.
She did? I love her so much, and I haven't seen her in such a long time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he all, right?
Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter.
I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize.
That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset. Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.
Is Charlie pressuring you to do things you don't think you should be doing?
What do you mean?
Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?
For what?
Maddy's party.
I don't feel very festive.
Where have you been?
I'm not the maid!
Would they go over my girdle or under?
Isn't that awfully forward?
You know, dear, I think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea, but the next time you come up with something, please don't stay out all night. Just tell us. We'll believe you.
No, just a friend of mine. I don't think he Likes JellO.
What does Charlie think about that?
You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends. Besides, it's over with me and Charlie.
What? When did it happen? Your dad and I always expected you two to get married.
Sheerotards. Catchy name, isn't it? Like leotards.
What are you doing?
I'm just happy to see you.
Come on! Mom said you were sick. You're never happy to see me.
I'm sorry about that. I really want us to be closer. I have enough unresolved relationships in my... life.
Teenagers are weird. And you're the weirdest.
Let's do something together.. Do you want to play Monopoly? Or Careers... Clue... Snakes and Ladders?
It's unbelievable. The man never ages.
Look at Kenny Rossi. Isn't he dreamy? I wish he'd break up with Arlene. She thinks she's so great.
Don't eat the red ones.
Why not? They're my favorite.
And the butter.
Mom, sit down for a minute. This is so nice, all of us being together again like this.
You think this'll cheer Dad up?
I remember that dress.
I remember when you got that locket, too. You were so excited I think you showed it to the whole school.
What's up?
I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.
Don't be silly, I'm the best in the county.
I know you are, but you have to stop. I couldn't tell you before, I didn't know if I should. But you have to stop before you hurt yourself.
I spend three hours a day practicing. I have trainers, I know what I'm doing.
But accidents can happen.
Not to me they don't. I'm going to win the State, then the. Nationals, and then I'm going to the Olympics.
Rosalie, please, listen to me! You have to stop.
Are you Peggy Sue Kelcher?
I was once. Richard!? Richard Norvik? I didn't recognize you.
You look exactly the same.
Hello. Nice to meet you. Please call me Peggy. I'm Peggy Bodell now.
Where's Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh.
He's not here. We're getting divorced.
The only time people like Dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me. That guy, Doug Snell, who shook my hand when we walked in, he used to call me a foureyed worm.
Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.
You were always friendly to me. I appreciated that. You know, this used to be a fantasy of mine.
What was?
Dancing with you.
You're a sweet man, Richard.
I guess part of us never really leaves high school.
Congratulations on the math contest, Richard.
I have to talk to you. It's very important.
I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?
What a great kite.
I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
I want to ask you a question. Do you think...time travel is possible?
Are you doing some kind of science project?
Sort of.
And then, there's Richard's Burrito.
What's that?
That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
I know what a burrito is.
Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.
What's inside?
You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes
So you think time travel is possible? For people?
Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants.
Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?
Okay. I promise.
This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years.
You have a blind grandfather. One day you're going to invent a machine that reads books for blind people. I read about it. You're going to be famous. You're going to invent a lot of things.
How, did you know about my grandfather?
Because I'm telling you the truth. I know what's going to happen. There's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants. And an American named Neil Armstrong is going to walk on the moon. On July 20, 1969.
But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it?
I'd be very careful if I were you. You don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain.
That's why I was getting a divorce.. What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
You look pretty good for a corpse.
Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
You're giving me the creeps.
Am I dead or not?
What're you doing?
Okay, you're not dead, but according to every law of science what you say happened to you is impossible.
You're a molecule in chaos, a discontinuent aberration. Maybe you've just got powers of precognition. Well, maybe you're just out of whack.
I told you, I've already lived my life. I don't know how or why I'm here, but you have to help me get back. I want to get back to my real life!
All right, I'll work on it, I'll, do some research. But in the meantime, don't get crazy.
I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow.
The way I see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world.
I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.
But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.
I'm talking about invention, no investment. I know what people think of me. Mr. Spasmatician. Dick the Square Root. I'll show them. You said I was going to be a millionaire. And you're gonna help!
Richard, take it easy.
No offense, but for a person who says she's lived an extra lifetime, you certainly are thick. Money is power.. Money makes people respect you...
How come you never ask me any important questions? Don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? What about your family? What about people?
I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them.
Give me some credit, will you?
Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner.
Wbat're you talking about?
Look it's very simple. You tell me everything that hasn't been invented yet, and I'll invent it. We'll be partners. Fiftyfifty.
You're taking advantage of a minor.
Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.
Come on. You can't be serious.
There are major fortunes to be made here. Leisure time and lifestyles.
Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?
You don't have to use pig Latin! Nobody could possibly know what we're talking about.
All right. These are the choices: microwave ovens, pocket calculators, Walkmans, digital watches and miniature TV's.
Richard! They don't have any! They never heard of them! Isn't that wonderful?
What are you talking about?
The wave of the future! I've decided on our first fortune! I'll see you later. You just think high tech.
Hi, Richard.
What are you doing?
Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.
That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future?
Yep. It's going to be a law. I broke up with Charlie last night.
That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.
It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time.
Cheer up. Now you can give some other guy a shot. Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht.
For God's sake, forget the money! I'm going crazy! I'm a walking anachronism. I'm a puddle of deja I'm worried about my kids, Scott must be scared to death, I think my daughter's doing drugs again. I can't have any fun here, I don't have that innocence any more. I can't keep all this in anymore. I feel Like I'm going to explode.
Look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case. May I make a suggestion?
Like what?
Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before?
What do you know about hypnosis?
Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.
Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?
You are completely relaxed. When I count to three, you will open your eyes. One... two... three. We'll start with something easy. What is your name?
Peggy Sue Kelcher. Or, Peggy Bodell. I'm not sure.
Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?
Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...
What will they be made of?
I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.
Silicon is from sand.
In the future, will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her?
No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young.
You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex?
No. The Pill will be for birth control. But girls do like sex. Maybe not the first time.
Will you take of f your blouse?
No! Yes! I'll be right out, Dad. Oh shit! Peggy, I'm going to snap you out of it.
I couldn't help it  I loved him.
Richard! You should be ashamed of yourself.
Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
Hey! Do you have any idea how much those beakers cost? I usually charge for hypnosis.
What's the matter?
It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
Not true. I think I'm making real progress on the microchip.
I came to say goodbye.
Goodbye? Where're you going? What about our partnership? I'm making real progress with the microchip.
You were meant to You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to.
So are you. You've got a vision.
Vision? I'm a walking anachronism! I've upset my parents. I miss my kids. I could be trapped here forever! And poor Charlie...I got pregnant on my 18th birthday and we had to get married. Tomorrow's my birthday! I've got to get out of here now.
Did you break up with Charlie?
Yeah, yeah. I'm taking a big gamble. I've loved him for a long, long time.
Okay. Why don't we do something visionary. Change your destiny, Peggy Sue. Change your destiny and marry me.
No! No! No! Peggy Sue got married! Case closed. I don't want to marry anybody. Goodbye Richard.
Wait! I'll go with you!
Why are you bothering me about this? Can't you leave it be?
...the pathologist... he said that you had reported a similar incident... with a cat...
The Creed cat, that's right. Bastard's name was "Church". Let me guess. Your dog's tissue isn't healing, pupils aren't dilating... maybe you can't find a heartbeat?
You want some advice, friend? You get in your car, you pick up your family... and you get the hell out of that town.
Believe what you saw, Matthews. The dog was dead.
Did she always have reporters following her around like this?
I hear you moved into town.
That's Renee alright.
When I was young I thought cats were the girls and dogs were the boys.
Thee facial lacerations should heal up pretty quickly. I'll give you som antibiotic cream--
I hear you've got Marjorie Hargrove working for you now.
I was building a doggy door.
What?
I don't know what you expected to find, Matthews. There's nothing wrong with the antigens, nothing to indicate an unusual death...
Wait, there must be some mix-up. He was... the dog is alive.
You took over for Doctor Yolander?
Yes... why?
Is something wrong?
I'm real excited about working for you Mr. Matthews...
Out?
He's probably going up to the Pet Sematary. Kids've been going out there on Halloween night for years.
What do they do up there?
What happened to you?
I had a little run-in with Zowie.
I hope he doesn't have rabies.
How long ago did this guy retire?
What's wrong?!
What's a lunch cost these days? You want ten?
You nervous? New town, new school. I know it must be pretty hard for you...
Hey! How was your first day at school?
What?
I think so.
Your Mom and I loved each other, Geoff. Don't ever think that we didn't.
Who was that?
Hey! Where're you off to?
Just out.
"Out." Well that's great, Geoff. Look, I've been letting you get away with a lot these past few weeks, but I'm not going to stand for crap like this. I don't care if it's Halloween... it's a school night, and if you do this again...
Geoff, dinner's ready! Geoff?!
What are you talking about?
Geoff, this is crazy. Zowie didn't die.
All set?
So where're we going?
Damn dog stuck his nose in on my rabbits and they ganged up on him. I swear that dog's an idiot.
Drew, I don't remember inviting Zowie in for dinner.
Not that much appreciation. I thought we were gonna tone down that flabby ass.
Your momma's worried sick over you. You take off in the middle of the night, you don't show up for school. What're you trying to prove?
Zowie...
What's his name?
I've never seen anybody punch Clyde before.
He pissed me off.
I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was dead...
You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
What was all that stuff about dead people coming back to life?
Is this a good spot?
I'm not burying him here...
Why not?
This is it... I wasn't sure if it even really existed.
What did?
Come on, that's just a bullshit story. You said so yourself...
What if it's not bullshit? If I bury Zowie there, and it works... ...he'll come back alive.
Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.
You want me to help?
I've never had anyone die before... ...but I guess you get over it. I mean, eventually...
It's getting pretty late. We better go.
Maybe he wasn't dead when we buried him.
You think my Dad'll figure out why he's not getting better?
How can he not have a heartbeat?
It's weird...
What do you mean?
What was that all about? You think he's trying to scare us?
Do you think everyone that came back would be like Gus?
I don't know... ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you...
I gotta go back and do my chores...
You ever think about running away?
Geoff? Anybody see my boy?
How long have you been here?
How did it go with your father last night?
Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight... I mean... he misses you, Mom...
I know, Mom.
Mom...
Are we interrupting, Andy?
In a word, Bob...
If MacroSystems wins, an energetic, young company will be destroyed, five thousand Americans will be out of work. Moreover, the laws of copyright and anti-trust were enacted to prevent exactly the kind of bullshit Macrosystems is trying to pull.
Andy, do you know who reps Kronos Inc.?
Yes!
Jesus.
I don't know what to do, Bob.
What in God's name... ?
Bob...
What's wrong with your face?
What's wrong with my face? You want to know what's wrong with my face? I've got a skin condition. Next question, Bob? No more questions? Fine. Now can you help me find the complaint?
Allright. Calm down.
What was the file name?
K-R-O-one.
Do you really think so, Andy?
Why, Beckett?
Thanks, Walter.
What's that on your forehead, pal?
You're right, I probably just misfiled...
This time. What about next time?
Perhaps... you're right. I've certainly been busy. With the Kronos complaint, a preliminary injunction hearing and the Saunders trial all falling at the same time...
Some people think you have an attitude problem, Beckett.
Excuse me, Charles. With all due respect... this is... preposterous! It doesn't make any sense, it sounds as if we're talking about someone else. Pardon the lack of humility, but I've had the distinct impression I was kind of... one of the rising stars around here. And I feel that wasn't just my imagination. And I also think I deserve to know what's really
Thanks, you guys.
Aren't you giving an exam?
I almost didn't make it to the bathroom, Miguel. I almost lost control right in front of everybody.
It could be parasites, an infection...
Don't apologize for me.
That's the third time. I better call the office. Would you relax, please?
Why are you getting dressed?
Thanks for leaving school, and coming here, and... I will be back. An hour, tops.
You're going to the office?!
You're leaving the hospital? You're going into the office looking like that? Are you insane?
One hour!
Drew!
Jerk... What did you say?
You got that right, Mikey... You still believe that, don't you?
Hold still. Shit. The goddamn vein's clotted. We have to go the goddamn hospital, so they can change the goddamn catheter.
I have too much work to do. Skip the treatment.
We're not skipping this treatment.
I said, skip it, Michael. It's my treatment.
Fuck you.
Fuck you. This shit's probably not doing me any good anyway.
What's wrong with you?
Close the law book.
I'm not going to close the--
ALLRIGHT IT'S CLOSED! Jesus!
The least you can do is look at me, while I'm sticking this shit into your arm. Forget the fucking case, one hour a day, and give me a little of your time.
You don't think there's much time left, do you?
That's not what I said.
You're scared. You think we're near the end.
No.
Maybe I should start making plans, is that what you think? Start planning my memorial service? "Begin to prepare for the inevitable."
Maybe you should think about it.
What's that mean?!
Maybe you should think about it.
I'm not going to die.
That's right. We're on the Positive Plan. You don't have a Fatal Disease, you have Manageable Illness.
You want me to give up? Let this thing turn us into <u>victims</u>?
Then, what <u>are</u> we, Drew?! The <u>winners</u>? "Ladies and gentlemen, the first prize of AIDS goes to Andrew Beckett and his lover Miguel..." Excuse me, I'm not your lover. I'm your Care Partner. FUCK!
I'm not ready to die.
I'm ready...
Ready for what, baby?
Whatever.
It is, and it isn't, Charles. Macrosystem's new software copies all the best-known elements of Kronos' spreadsheet program. If they're allowed to sell it, Kronos will get undersold right out of business. For me, the legal principle, involved is copyright infringement.
Thanks, Charles.
Thanks for coming in.
I know that, Charles.
We've been talking it over, Andy. Your future that is... We feel that, because we respect you so much, we have to be honest with you.
Take it easy, Walter.
If you'd lost confidence in me, why did you give me the Kronos suit?
I hoped the challenge would improve your performance. You could say it was a carrot.
You can save it for the jury, Charles. I want to hear you say, under oath, in front of a judge and a jury, I'm a bad lawyer. Gentlemen. Counselor.
Longstreet's interested in the Harrisburg deal.
Mr. Beckett, I'm sorry...
About my blood work?
... meanwhile, I'd like to prepare you for a colonoscopy, so we can take a look inside.
This is my partner. We keep records of hospital visits. Nothing personal.
I'm trying to help your "partner." You're not a member of his immediate family, I could have you removed from the ER.
Your Honor, since Rockwell Corp. began construction, the surrounding residential neighborhood has been enshrouded in a cloud of foul-smelling, germ-carrying, pestilent dust. My client is being forced to breathe known carcinogens daily! Other residents are coming forth on a daily basis to add their voices of outrage!
Innocuous?
Defined by Webster's as harmless.
Client of yours?
Jesus Christ, what happened to you?
Whoa-oh! Sorry, I...
It's okay. Can I sit down?
New baby?
One week old.
Congratulations.
Little baby girl.
Kids are great.
Thanks, Beckett. I'm real excited about it. What can I do for you?
I was fired by Wyant Wheeler. I plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against Charles Wheeler and his partners.
You want to sue Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown?
Correct. I'm seeking representation.
Continue.
I misplaced an important complaint. That's their story. Want to hear mine?
How many lawyers did you go to, before you called me?
Nine.
Continue.
I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it.
We?
My lover and I.
Your... lover?
Miguel Alvarez. We've lived together for nine years.
Continue.
Hell, they are staring. What's that shit on your face?
Big trouble.
I buy that.
The law says people with disabilities cannot be terminated, so long as they can perform the duties required by their position...
Okay, okay... They discover you have this horrible, disgusting, terminal illness, and they panic, for any number of perfectly valid reasons. They're frightened for themselves, their families... Maybe it's the homo angle. Maybe they don't want to rub elbows with someone who's just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne. And how do they explain your status to the client
Okay... They want you out. It's against the law to fire you for having AIDS, so they make you look like a fuck up. Which leads us to the mysterious, lost file.
They sabotaged me.
I knew you were going to say that. I don't buy it, and I don't see a case.
Look. I know I have a case. If you don't want to take it for personal reasons...
Thanks for your time.
Beckett? I'm sorry about... what's happened to you. It's a fucking kick in the head.
Oh, Beckett. How's it goin'?
Who'd you get?
What?
Find a lawyer?
I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
Huh? Oh. Great. She's great.
What's her name?
Rayisha.
How did they find out?
The partner who spotted the lesion, Walter Kenton, used to work for Benton, Myers, in D.C. There's a paralegal there, Maria Torres. She's had lesions on and off for three years. She says it was common knowledge around the office that her lesions were caused by AIDS.
They didn't fire her?
So Kenton connected the... lesion, <u>and</u> whatever suspicions he had about your personal life... to this woman, Maria... and blew the whistle on you. Suddenly you're losing files, and it's time to let you go. But, up to this point, you've been their Golden Boy, their rising star... Their behavior is... inconsistent.
There is no relevant precedent.
Arline decision. Supreme Court.
One more thing, Your Honor...
PARRTYY!
We're friends of Beckett's.
Beckett. You seem... better. Energized, more alive...
I'm a law suit.
Not bad.
Get it?
What do you want?
Beer. We need to go over your Q and A.
Excuse me, I'm having a goddamn party, is that allright with you?
Sure. It's fine.
No, we have to do it. But later, allright?
You think I'm uncomfortable...
Correct.
You survived your first gay party intact.
Let me tell you something, okay? When you're brought up, like the rest of us, in a place like where I was brought up, there's not a whole lot of discussion about... homosexuals. As a kid, you're taught right away that queers are weird, queers are funny, they're a danger to kids, they're afraid to fight, and they all want to cop your joint.
Thank you for sharing that with me, Joe.
When you refer to Wheeler, call him Charles, to show how you'd been admitted to the inner circle, you were considered one of them.
Uh huh...
Beckett?
Charles. Okay. Miller?
What?
Then we establish how Wheeler's boys recruited you after law school...
What have you prayed for?
For a healthy baby. For Lisa to make it through the delivery. For the Phillies to get into the playoffs.
There's a possibility I won't be around for the end of this trial.
I've considered that.
What happens?
We proceed, representing your estate.
I've made provisions in my will for some charities. Miguel will need a lawyer. I know it's not your area...
I know a good probate lawyer.
Opera?
Want to hear my favorite aria?
I'll look over the Q and A.
Particularly, Charles.
What impressed you about him?
He was... the kind of person I thought I wanted to be.
What kind of person is that?
Obviously, at this time, you weren't sick.
It's possible I was infected with the HIV virus at that time, but I wasn't diagnosed until several years later.
A regular all-American guy?
I suppose you could say that.
Except... you were gay?
I still am.
In the years you worked at Wyant Wheeler, did you ever tell Charles Wheeler you were gay?
No. I didn't.
Can you explain <u>why</u> you didn't?
Are you a good lawyer?
I'm an excellent lawyer.
What makes you an excellent lawyer?
I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. It's the only thing I've ever wanted to do.
What do you love about it?
Do you have any lesions on <u>any</u> part of your body, at this time, that resemble the lesions that were on your face at the time you were fired?
Yes. On my torso.
Can you see the lesions on your chest in this mirror?
Yes.
What do you call a thousand lawyers chained together at the bottom of the ocean?
What?
Excellent work, Joe. I thank you.
I better get home. Lisa and I are having some friends over.
Thanks for coming by.
Rach.
I'm late, I have to pick up Amy from her afterschool but I want to talk to you about that Hansen thing.
I thought I was supposed to be covering for you. God, Andy, you look awful.
Fucking Word Processing lost my Kronos complaint. Which must be filed by fucking five o'clock! If it's late, there's no case... Every problem has a solution.
What can I do?
You said earlier you aspired to be the kind of person who had "an adventurous spirit." Is that correct?
Something like that.
Do you take risks?
In my work? Yes. Calculated risks. You have to.
In general. Do you take risks in other areas of your life?
Not unnecessary ones.
What kind of movies do they show there?
Gay movies.
Gay <u>pornographic</u> movies?
Yes.
Do men have sex with each other in that theater?
When? Approximately what year did this event take place?
I guess it was 1984, 85.
Were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there, called AIDS, and that you could contract it through sexual activity?
It's impossible to know exactly when or how I was infected with HIV.
But you <u>were</u> having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?
That happened once. People weren't talking about AIDS then, the way we are now. Or safe sex.
You'd <u>heard</u> of AIDS in 1984, 85?
Do you need a break?
No.
While you were employed at Wyant Wheeler, you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual, correct?
That is <u>not</u> correct. I never lied about it.
Did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk?
No.
Some do. I didn't.
As a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right?
In some situations.
Yes.
You could have infected him, isn't that right?
Miguel has not been infected. As I said, we weren't aware of AIDS, then, or how it is spread.
Really?
You've testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with, correct?
That's right.
And it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had AIDS and fired you.
Absolutely.
Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
By the time I was fired, there were four lesions on my face, much bigger...
Answer the question, please.
No. I can't really see it.
Hello?
Andy! This is a nice surprise. How are you, hon?
I'm fine.
What's Dr. Gillman say?
Gillman says I'm fine. My blood work is excellent. T-cells are up. Just a sec ... Yes, I think that would alleviate most of our concerns. My platelets look good too.
Hi, Mom. How do you feel on your fortieth anniversary?
Ancient. How do you think I feel? Put that thing down and give me a hug. Andrew, stop! ... He still doesn't listen.
Where's Dad?
Mom?
All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights.
He was losing weight. He looked kind of tired sometimes. But he was working so hard... Still, I felt something was wrong. And I can't believe <u>they're</u> saying they didn't notice anything.
Miss Burton? Do you still work at Wyant Wheeler?
Yes.
Were you recently promoted?
Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department.
Ms. Burton. You're black.
Is that a question?
No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
In what way?
Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings.
Apparently, Mr. Wheeler felt they were too... "ethnic" is the word she used. She said he would like it if I wore something smaller, less garish, and... more "American."
What did you say?
I said my earrings <u>are</u> American. They're African-American.
And, when lawyers break the law, when this society loses respect for the law, when that day comes, our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground, and our children and grandchildren will live like savages.
Objection!
Objection!
Objection!
We object, Your Honor. It would unfairly influence the jury.
You had contact with someone who has AIDS, and you're worried.
The HIV virus can only be transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids, namely blood and semen.
Leave that.
We're going to draw blood.
Why are we going to do that?
Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
The guy sat in my office! You can't get AIDS that way, right?
Right.
It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?
Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about...
A homosexual encounter.
Get real.
Unprotected sex with a prostitute.
Uh.... No. Not really.
Andrew Beckett represented your company in a lawsuit in 1990, is that correct?
But, Andrew Beckett was in charge of litigation for the suit.
That's correct.
Were you pleased with his work?
Mr. Laird, when I approached you about being a witness at this trial, and you agreed, you gave sworn testimony in a deposition. Is that correct?
That's correct.
According to the deposition, you said you were "thrilled, impressed, overwhelmed" by the quality of Andrew Beckett's work. Do you remember saying that?
Okay, Mr. Laird. Explain this to me like I'm a four year old: Did Andrew Beckett win your lawsuit for you or not?
We won.
Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
It's a long way between being overwhelmed and being satisfied. A cheeseburger may be satisfying whereas caviar and champagne and roast duck and baked Alaska for dessert might be considered overwhelming. Do you agree?
I might.
Five months ago you characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar and now you're calling him a cheeseburger. Your standards have shifted a great deal, and I'd like to know why you've changed your mind.
Andy. Before we begin, I'd just like to say: everyone in this room is your friend.
Let's put it this way, Andy: your place in the future of this firm is no longer secure.
In a word, yes.
And I hate to rush you out of here, but...
But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
Explain to me, if you can, Mr. Wheeler, explain this to me like I'm a ten year-old. This trial is not about a disease, is that what you're saying? <u>Not</u> about your understandable, if unfounded, fear of catching AIDS through casual contact with someone who has it? You're saying, this trial is about Andrew Beckett's character. Am I getting this right?
Sometimes it seems like society is <u>run</u> by these kinds of people.
What kind of people?
Good school. What year?
Second.
Great.
Would you like to have a drink with me? I just finished a game, I could use a beer. I don't pick up people in drug stores every day.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... do you think... ? You think <u>I'm</u>... ... gay?
Aren't you?
What's the matter with you? Do I look gay to you?
Do I look gay to you? Relax.
Relax? I ought to kick your faggoty little ass for you!
Don't you know this is exactly the kind of bullshit that makes people hate you guys?
Fuck you! You want to kick my ass? You want to try? Asshole.
You're the asshole, buddy.
You load the film... ? No, on this side... or this side? Don't move the baby!
You have a problem with gays, Joe.
How many gays do you know?
How many do you know?
Lots.
Who?
Your Aunt Teresa is gay? That beautiful, sensuous woman is a... <u>lesbian</u>?
Duh...
Since when?
Probably since she was born.
Allright. I admit it: I'm prejudiced. I don't want to work with a homosexual. You got me.
Okay, Joe...
I mean, two guys, doing the horizontal thing? I don't get it. Don't they get confused? "Is that mine? I thought it was yours." Hey, call me old fashioned, call me conservative... I think maybe you have to be a man to get just how nauseating the whole basic idea really is.
Fine, Joe.
And the way they work out, pumping up, so they can be macho and faggot at the same time... I can't <u>stand</u> that shit. Now I'm being totally honest with you.
That's perfectly clear.
Don't know, Joe.
Is there some kind of expression I've picked up from Beckett?! Some kind of fairy attitude I've unconsciously adopted?! Am I walking different?! Some kind of vocal thing?! Have I picked up some kind of homo <u>vibe</u>?!
Have you changed your aftershave?
Joe?
Yeah... ?
Two men making love... ? Now tell me again... <u>why</u> is that disgusting?
Okay, so... help me with this one, Joe... Is it disgusting for someone to put his dick into someone's mouth? Or, is it disgusting for someone to take a dick into <u>their</u> mouth?
Did I ever tell you, I hate costume parties?
I'll see you in an hour, max.
Right.
Why didn't you cross at the crosswalk?
Yeah. Do I have a case?
Of course you have a case! Now, I want you to go with my assistant, Iris, and fill out some forms. She'll tell you about our fee arrangement. Mrs. Finley? Any back pain since the accident? Dizziness? Nightmares?
Now that you mention it...
Whoa, whoa... What do you expect them to say, you're Alan Dershowitz?
Anywhere from two weeks, to several months.
Not when I was in the Navy.
So during those long voyages, months at a time, out to sea, no women in sight, a hundred, hardworking, robust, young men, in the prime of their life, at the peak of their natural appetites, desires, their god- given, hormonal <u>instincts</u>... Anything going on?
Going on... like...?
Yeah. But we took care of him.
How did you do that?
You taught him a lesson.
Yes, we did.
<u>She</u> didn't try to conceal it.
So you are aware of the difference between a lesion and a bruise, is that correct?
I <u>know</u> the difference. That doesn't mean I'm always able to recognize the difference.
But didn't you avoid contact with Ms. Torres, after you found out she had AIDS? She says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her, is that correct?
Attorney for the plaintiff?
Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services.
I've seen your television commercials. "If you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others... It should say, "through the <u>negligence</u> of others."
I'll take that under consideration, Your Honor.
If it please Your Honor, we <u>hope</u> to settle this matter.
By God you <u>will</u> settle it! If you force this case to trial, young man, you'll regret it for the rest of your natural-born days... Now, Joseph. What would you require to settle this matter today?
Reinstatement at full salary. Back pay covering the period of unemployment and...
Based on what my client would have earned over the next three years, including benefits and projected raises, and the extraordinary cost of medical care for someone with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome... We would settle today for the very fair amount of one million five hundred thousand dollars.
In this courtroom, Mr. Miller, justice is blind. To matters of race, creed, color, religion. And sexual orientation.
With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we?
Let's continue.
This would be a good time to break for the day...
Your Honor? May I have ten minutes in re-direct?
It's good to be King, hey Charles?
Andy. It seems that something has come over you, lately: A kind of... stupor, a fogginess, a lack of focus... Earth to Andy. Anybody home?
Julius!
Andrew brought AIDS into our offices, into our men's room. He brought AIDS to our annual goddamn family picnic.
Wait a minute. The man was fired for incompetence, not because he has AIDS. You didn't know he was sick, did you, Bob?
You'll be sorry, Beckett.
... to suit their personal desires, and the rest of us have to live with it.
... interview every employee, support staff, associates, partners. Did <u>any</u> of them know Andy was sick? <u>How</u> did they know? Did he tell them? Did they notice something was wrong with his appearance? None of this information got to the managing partners. We know that. Make sure everyone else does too... And Beckett: I want to know everything about his personal life. Did he
Jesus.
What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
Charles...
What deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to? What is it, Bob?!
That's kind of... extreme, Walt. Andy's private life is none of our business.
Bob. You're trying my patience. Andrew Beckett is making his private life our business. We gave him Kronos. Did he say, "I'm sick. I might not be able to see this through?"
He was doing a great job.
I've discovered something interesting, Charles.
... keep them from that area, on grounds of relevancy. What, Bob?
Very interesting, Bob. Let's make a note of that. Andy didn't lose the complaint in his computer. He never put it in. He lied about that, too.
Charles...
I didn't tell the others, I was afraid to...
... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...
... But we shouldn't have fired him...
Don't wanna miss this.
Gonna lose everybody out here....
What? What is it?
You came for us....
Probably okay to talk to me now.
Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started. Where you goin'?
Audrey? Oh, Audrey....
Tell me that was you.
Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
Oh, Lord....
You mean...tonight? With all those things still out there?
Liquid oxygen canisters inside. Start ripping them out. Quick hits only -- try to make it last.
Bottle-count.
I didn't want you to leave me there... back at the ship...that's why I didn't say anything....
Bring the light!
What're they doing? What're <u>we</u> --
Three full bottles. But almost time to refill.
Tell me about the sounds. You told them you heard something right before.... If you don't talk to me, Johns'll take another crack at it -- at your skull.
'Mean the whispers?
What whispers?
All you people are so scared of me -- an' most days, I'd take that as a compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta worry about now.
You did this? To yourself?
Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."
Heard about it. Just never seen it.
Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say? Slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here. Three ass-kick suns. Maybe I did do a few people. But not this one. No ma'am, not this time.
Then where is he? He's not in the hole. We looked.
Power cells.
They're coming.
Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet. Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape.
I got the quick-and-ugly version.
An' now you're worried about a repeat of history?
Entered our minds.
I asked what <u>you</u> thought.
Why, what'd you hear?
Riddick...was thinkin' we should make some kind of deal. Just in case, you know, this actually --
Had it with deals.
But I just wanted to say --
Been a long time since anyone's trusted me. That's somethin' right there.
We can, can't we? Trust you?
Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't we still following them?
What do you see? Riddick?
Riddick? What the hell are you --
Canyon ahead. I circled once to buy some time to think.
What about her?
Back to the ship, huh?
Get out of our way.
How many you see?
One or two.
We're just here to carry your light, aren't we? Just the torch-bearers.
As fast as you can.
You sure you can keep --
So where the hell's God now, huh? I'll tell you where! He's up there PISSING ON ME!
Tell me the settlement is right there! RIDDICK, PLEASE!
Strong survival instinct. Admire that in a woman.
I promised them we'd go back with more light. And that's exactly what we're gonna do..
Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.
What, you're afraid?
Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was <u>his</u> monkey. I only deal in life and death. All that stuff in between? Some shade of grey my eyes don't see.
<u>I trusted you</u>, Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.
Just come with me!
They're already dead. Get on board.
You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that.
Step aboard, Carolyn.
I can't....I can't....
Here. Make it easy on you.
Don't do this to me....
Just give me your hand.
But they...they could still be....
You'd die for them?
I would try for them.
You barely know them.
This is it? Booze? <u>That's</u> what you have to drink?
What do my eyes see?
Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should flee.
Christ, you don't know what's out there!
There....
Like the light is scalding it.
...one cutting torch...one handlight here, two more in the cabin...I <u>think</u> two more....
Spirits. Anything over 45 proof burns well.
How many bottles?
Not sure. Ten?
Those umbrellas, the ones that mist. Would they burn? If you got a receipt?
Possibly.
I hate to kill a beautiful theory with an ugly fact, but that sand-cat won't run at night.
Let's move. Just a detour. He'll get us there.
Can we switch?
What, switch what?
Hey.
Hey, who?
Amazing. I'm Johns.
And him?
Big Evil?
We just keep him locked up forever?
Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on --
I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous?
S'matter?
A very good sign. That's Riddick's direction. You do <u>not</u> wanna be caught in the dark with this guy.
Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset.
What?
Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you even more.
No, no, I wanted to get away.
Better keep moving....
Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn.
Promise me. Swear to me you won't --
You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.
So now you know.
Didn't bite.
What?
No juice, looks like it's been laid up for years. But we might be able to adapt --
Sorry. Thought I heard something.
Like what?
...I don't play that...I don't play that so just try again. C'mon, Riddick, tell me a better lie....
He used that?
Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
So why isn't it all bloody?
I <u>know</u> what happened -- he went off on the guy, buried him on the hill somewhere, and now he's trying to --
Let's just be sure.
I <u>am</u> sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into --
<u>We're gonna find the body</u>, Johns. Christ, you're a cop. Why am I tellin' you this? We gotta go down and find it.
Well, don't ask me to.
Thought you didn't believe his story.
Nobody else is going down but me, okay?
Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.
What, you think I'm doin' this to prove something?
You said it, not me. Let's just not let one bad call lead to another.
Little ratty-ass.
Okay, that should buy us a sys-check. But we'll need more cells.
How many?
15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five. Five total to launch.
Rag it, Riddick. Nobody wants your theories on --
Let's board this up and get the hell gone. They seem to stick to the dark, so if we stick to daylight, should be all --
60 years ago.
...need those cells from the crash ship. Shit, still gotta check out the hull, patch the wings --
Let's wait on the power cells.
Wait for what? Until it's so dark we can't even find our way back to --
We're not sure <u>when</u> it happens, so let's not --
He can pilot?
Hijacked a prison transport, made a helluva good run 'fore I tracked him down.
Okay, maybe that's a <u>good</u> thing. Maybe I can use him to help with --
You said we were going to trust him now. You said there was a deal.
Oh, this is a dangerous game you're playing, Johns.
May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' --
You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.
You know, he hasn't harmed any of us. Far as I can tell, he hasn't even lied to us. Just stick to the deal, Johns. Let him go if that's what it --
Dancin' on razor blades here...
You're not a real cop, are you? Just some mercenary who goes around talkin' about the law like --
I never said I was.
You have a little caffeine in the morning, I have a little morphine. So what?
And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you <u>born</u> lucky?
Not a problem unless you're gonna make --
<u>You</u> made it a problem when you let Owens die like that. When you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team.
Owens was already dead. His brain just hadn't caught on to that fact.
My first run-in with Riddick. Went for the sweet-spot and missed. They had to leave a piece of the shiv in there. I can feel it, sometimes, pressing against the cord. So maybe the care and feeding of my nerve-endings is my business.
Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!
Oh, lady. If you're in your right mind, I pray you go insane.
Look, we gotta think about everyone now -- the kid especially. How scared is she gonna be out there?
Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen.
Smoke screen for what?
For your own fear.
How much you weigh, Johns?
What the hell's it matter?
How much?
79 kilos.
He'll lead you over the first cliff. You know that, don't you?
We're just burnin' light here.
You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.
So you noticed too?
We aren't completely stupid.
Hey, <u>you're</u> the one who got me out here, turned me into a goddamn sled dog. An' now you 'spect me to go back like a <u>whipped</u> dog?
I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay? Now let's just go back to the ship.
I dunno. Nice breeze, wide open spaces -- you know, I'm startin' to enjoy myself out here.
Are you fucking high again? Just listen to --
This does not help us, Johns.
-- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us --
Just shut up, okay?
-- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris had it right -- we <u>are</u> disposable. We're just walking ghosts to her.
We cannot go through there....
It's the atmosphere. Too much pressure, not enough oxygen. Might take a few days to --
So what the bloody hell happened, anyways?
Well? Is it just the pump?
Imam. We should leave soon. Before nightfall but while it's cooler.
What, you're goin' off, too?
Why did I fall on you?
He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --
I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22 weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean, I mean, why did I fall <u>at all</u>?
You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.
1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air. <u>Somethin'</u> took a swipe at us.
Fry?
Can't get my nose down...too much load back there....
You mean that "load" of passengers?
Look, Fry. Company says we're responsible for every one of those --
Company's not here, is it?
When captain went down, you stepped up -- whether you like it or not. Now they train you for this, so --
Owens!
I don't suppose....
So quiet. You get used to the sounds of the ship, then....
You know who Muhammad was?
Some prophet guy?
"Some prophet guy." And a city man. But he had to travel to the desert -- where there was quiet -- to hear the words of God.
You were on a pilgrimage? To New Mecca?
Chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj -- a great pilgrimage. To know God, better, yes, but to know yourself as well.
Frightening thought.
One is all?
I saw the cut-marks on the bones. Wasn't a natural die-off.
Hasan?
They're afraid of our light. That means we don't have to be so afraid of them.
And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?
Imam. Slow down.
What?
Don't stop, just slow down. Little more space 'tween us and them.
I would rather we all stay--
The sled as a shield....
Oh, no. No, no, no....
Has anyone seen the young one? Ali?
Well...we must keep her close, then. Here, she'll be safe if we put her between --
Where's Mr. Johns?
Which half?
What're you doin'?
Blessing you like the others. It's painless.
And pointless.
I see. Well, even if you don't believe in God, it doesn't mean He won't be --
'Cuz you don't spend half your life in lock-down with a horse-bit in your mouth and not believe. And you surely don't start out in a liquor store trash bin with an umbilical cord wrapped around your neck and not believe. Oh, absolutely I believe in God. And I absolutely hate the fucker.
He will be with us. Nonetheless.
Suleiman!
Get the girl back under. Keep going.
SULEIMAN!
New Mecca....
Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
For what? There is no water. You understand that, don't you?
"God is Great," yes?
We got you...it's okay, it's okay...we got you now....
I had the impression...from the model... that the two planets were moving as one. That there would be...a lasting darkness.
Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this.
We crossed our own tracks.
She's the captain, we should listen to --
...then we saw this.
King Tut's tomb....
A toast to whatever he just said.
What the hell are these?
So just like that. Wave your little wand and he's one of us now.
Well, just a skiff. Disposable, really.
Very big beads.
She's the pilot, she should stay close to the cells.
Found somethin' worse than me, huh?
Want you to remember this moment, Riddick. The way it coulda gone and didn't.
Say that again.
Here's the deal. You work without the chains, without the bit -- without the shivs. You help us get off this rock....
For what? The honor of goin' back to some asshole of a cell?
You'd cut me loose, Boss?
My recommendation: Do me. Don't take the chance that I'll get shiv-happy on your wannabe ass. Ghost me, Riddick. Would if I were you.
Are you fuckin' kidding me?
I'd rather piss glass.
Well, you got the big gauge.
Think about that reward, Johns.
I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
<u>Fuck me</u>. You said "clear."
Said "looks clear."
Well, what's it look like now?
Such as.
About how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!
What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not cut.
Aw, this can't be happening to me....
Ain't all of us gonna make it.
Six of us left. If we could get through that canyon and lose just one, that'd be quite a fucking feat, huh? A good thing, right?
Not if I'm the one.
Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies. It's called "triage," okay?
Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.
Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.
<u>Trawl</u> with it. There's a cable on the sled. We can drag the body behind us.
Nice embellishment.
Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just keep 'em off our scent.
So which one caught your eye?
What's her name, anyway?
Then let's not name the Thanksgiving turkey, okay? I assume you still got a shiv.
What, you 'spect <u>me</u> to do it?
What's one more to you? Like <u>this</u> is the one that sends you to Hell?
Aw, don't tell me you're growin' scruples.
Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum.
An' this?
Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very <u>very</u> rare, since the tribe's extinct.
'Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these things, be my guess.
So much for your nightfall.
Amazing how you can do without the essentials of life -- so long as you have the luxuries.
Not a star-jumper.
What, you don't really think they left with their clothes on the lines? Photos on the walls?
Maybe they had weight limits, you don't know.
You were tryin' to kill him too.
Take it.
What, it's broken?
Cornelius, if you have a moment today, I'd like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail.
Dr. Zaius --
Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?
Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.
You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
He exceeded his orders. His travel permit was promptly revoked.
How did you know we'd come here?
I ask you to reconsider the rash course you've taken. If you're convicted of heresy, the most you'll get is two years. But if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you'll hang for high treason.
We've never meant to be treasonable, sir. But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
Indeed, the very fact that these tools are unknown to us could suggest a culture in certain ways almost equal to our own. Some of the evidence is uncontestable ...
Don't speak to me in absolutes. The evidence is contestable.
I apologize.
A doll alone proves nothing. True. But the doll was found beside the jawbone of a man -- and no trace of simian fossils has turned up in this deposit.
Your conclusion is premature. Have you forgotten your Scripture? The Thirteenth Scroll? 'And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden, and chained him to a tree, and the children made sport of him.'
No sir, I haven't forgotten.
Seal the cave?
Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.
Do you have any weapons?
The best. But we won't need them.
As you wish.
To the diggings I worked at a year ago. It's a three day ride across the eastern desert, near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours.
You still don't believe me, do you?
Nothing much. The remnants of a life raft. Maybe a small flag. The emblem of my countrymen.
Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing.
Where does the river lead?
You've never told me why this region's called the Forbidden Zone.
When are you going to show me what's in the cave?
If there's any shooting, Dr. Zaius, you'll be the first to die. Depend on it.
Taylor, you're not in command here. Put down that gun.
Taylor, I'd rather you -
Yes. I have to agree. From all you've found so far, his position's as good as yours.
What are you doing there?
That was different. We thought you were .... inferior.
They can't convict us of that. You proved our innocence. Besides... ... his culture is our culture.
Do you have to work tonight?
No.
That's Bright Eyes. The one I was telling you about.
What's so special about him?
Look -- she remembers.
Remembers what?
The blood transfusion.
It's a stunt. Humans don't write.
Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?
Now, just a minute --
'Dodge was killed in the hunt. What happened to Landon?' I don't know.
Flight is a scientific impossibility.
Cornelius, why do you insist on provoking him?
'Then how do you account for me?,
I don't. And I'm not going to try.
But what about your theory? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it.
Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?
Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll have to accept it.
Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -
It's probably wrong --
-- that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate, possibly man. In his trip to the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time -
The evidence was very meager --
You didn't think so then.
That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.
'I am not a missing link.'
Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment.
Well, maybe they're not.
No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.
Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!
A toy. It floats on the air. Try it.
How did it go?
We'd better get started. If the mounted police pick up our trail, they'll come this far at least.
Got your sensors?
Yo!
Geiger counter?
Yo!
One pistol... twenty-four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one TX9. We've enough food and water for three days.
But how long is a day?
Nothing will grow here .... there's just a trace of hydrocarbons, and most of the nitrogen is locked into nitrates.
Any sign of dangerous ionization?
No.
Which direction?
That way.
Any particular reason?
Taylor -- quit riding him.
Where there's one there's another. And another. And another.
Well, at least they haven't tried to bite us.
Which one was wearing the strange clothes?
Will he live?
This place is dirty, doctor.
But the quota system's been abolished! You made it. Why can't I?
What do you mean, made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We don't have any authority.
You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.
That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.
Hmph.
The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals.
Objection. The accused is indeed a man. Therefore, he has no rights under ape law.
State your case, Mr. Prosecutor.
There is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our Faith
Come to the point, Dr. Honorius.
He can reason? With the Tribunal's permission, let me expose this hoax by direct examination.
That's true, Dr. Zaius. My witnesses -- correction -- my exhibits are on display in the amphitheater.
Objection! These remarks are profane and irrelevant.
Objection!
Yes, sir. The State charges Doctors Zira and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal, malicious mischief and scientific heresy.
Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith?
I admit, I know nothing of your culture.
Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think. Tell us why all apes are created equal.
Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others.
Ridiculous. That answer is a contradiction in terms. Tell us, Bright Eyes, why do men have no souls? What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain?
Good morning, Dr. Zira.
Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?
You could get hurt doing that, Doctor.
Awww, it still hurts, doesn't it?
Did you see that? It's remarkable!
Huh?
He's trying to form words.
What happened?
Those fools and their torches! Do you have any ointment?
Get me a collar and leash. I'm taking him to the infirmary.
He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules.
Landon! Send a last signal.
What signal?
It's no use ... there she goes.
Gone.
Well? Where are we? Have any notion, skipper?
Landon! Join the expedition.
Sorry... I was thinking of Stewart. What d'you suppose happened?
Air leak. Died in her sleep.
You don't seem very cut up about it.
It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year.
Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.
Apart from that, you look pretty chipper for a man who's two thousand and thirty one years old. I read the clocks. They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis. We've been away from Earth for two thousand years, give or take a decade. Still can't accept it, huh?
long pause) You know it.
Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.
Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
If only we could get a fix.
All right --
There's only one reality left. We're here and it's now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead.
Straighten me out on something. Why did you come along at all? You volunteered. Why? I'll tell you. They nominated you for the Big One and you couldn't turn it down. Not without losing your All-American standing
Climb off me, will you!
And the glory, don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes.
Taylor. I'm telling you --
Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you?
Don't bother
Dodge ... he's not like me at all. But he makes sense. Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew. I understand why he's here. But you...You're no seeker. You're negative.
But I'm not prepared to die.
Scarecrows?
Can we take a dip?
No cigar.
We got off at the wrong stop.
Who are you?
So you can talk. I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was her idea. You're not really going to the zoo. That's just our cover story in case we're stopped. Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property --
She comes along too.
Zira doesn't want your female.
I want her.
If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --
Shouldn't we be moving on?
Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?
Sorry, Lucius. You'll have to stay here and guard the horses.
Always giving orders. Just like every other adult.
Not everything. They left a hostage. How do you feel, Lucius?
Disillusioned... But vindicated! I've been right all along. You can't trust the older generation. It's a matter of values --
All right, all right. Will You do me a favor? No orders.
What is it?
I want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner.
They think you're behaving foolishly. I must say I agree. Where will you go?
Lucius.
I think you're making a mistake.
That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
What?
I told you not to bring the other one.
He wouldn't leave her.
Gorilla hunters ...
Who put them up?
The Hunt Club.
What is that?
A man, Dr. Maximus.
Yes, Sir. But this -- creature is a special case.
Why special?
You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here.
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down.
It says here that his name is Bright Eyes. You gave him that name yourself.
This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...
One is in a museum!
You destroyed his memory! His mind! His identity! And, you want to do the same to me!
Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential, and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal. You may proceed, Dr. Honorius.
Sustained. In all fairness, Dr. Zira, you must admit the accused is a nonape, and therefore has no rights under ape law.
ThatÕs a lie!
Mind your tongue, madame.
Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense, he asks that this statement be read into the record.
Read it yourself.
'I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. I am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal, while the apes remained..."
This is a joke in very poor taste.
How so?
Sustained.
Well...do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?
With one of them.
What about me?
Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, you performed a service for the State ... Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius. And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means?
No.
However, it's within my power to grant You a reprieve. That is why I summoned you here tonight. Tell me who and what you really are and where you come from, and no veterinary will touch you.
I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
You lied. Where is your tribe?
My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system.
Then how is it we speak the same language? Even in your lies, some truth slips through! That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?
What about it?
A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent. Where were you nurtured?
I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.
Certainly not. You're a mutant.
That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius claim. You're talking heresy, doctor.
Of course.
All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?
Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --
Then you admit --
I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?
Thank you for calling me Taylor. Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly. The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there. Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?
I don't know.
If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity.
I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?
Stop right there.
There is no contradiction between faith and science. True science.
What is your proposal?
When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
Twelve hundred years ago.
Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?
Of course.
I don't say he was a man like an Earthman, but I'd call him a close relative, for he was plagued by most of man's ills. Yet, fragile as he was, he came before you -- and was superior to you.
Tell him to pull back!
Then answer this: If ran was superior, why didn't he survive?
Then there is another jungle?
Of course, you could return with us. Our society might find a place for you and your mate.
Sure. In a cage.
Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
Why? From the first, I've terrified you, Doctor. And in spite of every sign that I'm an intelligent being who means no harm, you continue to hate and fear me. Why?
Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself.
What evidence? No weapons were found in the cave.
The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. Your breed made a desert of it, ages ago.
We're back at the beginning. I still don't know the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. A world turned wrong side up. A puzzle with one piece missing.
Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat feeling better?
Speak! Go on. Speak again.
My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!
I'm not acting! I can talk! How much proof do you want?
Where have you been? Why didn't you come to see me?
Shhhh!
What is this?
It's him...Landon.
Which one?
You! ... You knew about this?
No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.
Listen-
Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy. Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal.
Are you going to take her with you?
Yes.
Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
Maybe not.
You want her that much?
What's the diagnosis, doctor? A touch of the sun?
And that's your Minister of Science. Honor- bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge.
Taylor, please --
Taylor! Tell him.
Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave here alive.
Taylor, please -- don't treat him that way.
Why not?
It's humiliating.
Would you like to come along?
We can't.
Dr. Zira, I'd like to kiss you good-bye.
Go with God, Taylor. That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man.
He's moving his fingers!
Of course. He saw you moving yours.
Wouldn't it more properly be done in your office?
Dr. Zira -- you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert.
I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does.
Do you believe him?
Like you, I find it difficult.
But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished? You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.
This is his assertion.
How sad. Stuffed and mounted, eh? Dead men, like sunken ships, can tell no stories. And his other companion?
He doesn't know.
Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.
Secondly, if these 'tools' as you call them, are unidentified, why are they introduced as 'evidence' of anything?
But there's the doll, sir.
But suppose you find nothing but a wasteland. How will you survive?
But the proof? The doll?
Bunker...
...but 'Lias is still out there.
Elias is dead. Join up with the platoon. Move it.
He's dead! Where?... You saw him?
I SHIT on all o' you.
Elias - you take your squad and I'll take Tex and Francis from your squad. We move out in two-zero mikes.
Blood trail just keeps going and going but no body.
How the hell did he get away?
WHAT THE FUCK YOU DOING!
Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.
You're dead, you're fucking dead Elias!
Where the fuck is red platoon! Tell 'em to get their asses up here! What the fuck you doin' back here Elias? Round up your assholes and move 'em up front, we're getting chopped to shit.
...You keep pouring out that suppressing fire, Barnes. I don't wanna be caught out there with my ass hanging out you hear me?
We got boo-coo movement. 3rd Battalion just got hit 15 kliks north of here.
So what's the problem?
Says he can't walk.
Sarge?
Uh... Bob. Like to speak to you. Take a minute.
Yeah, what is it?
Bob, I got Elias' R&R... It's coming up in 3 days. Going to Hawaii. See Patsy. I never asked you for a break, I was hoping you... you'd send me in on the chopper with King... what do you say Chief?
I can't do that for you, Red... We need every swinging dick in the field. Sorry bout that...
Hey Bob, come on! Talk to me hunh, it's your friend Red, I'm only asking you for three days chief...
I'm talking to you Red and I'm telling you no. Get back to your position.
Bob, I gotta bad feeling about this, I... I'm telling you I got a bad feeling, man, I don't think I'm gonna make it... y'know what I mean?
Hey Big Harold, gimme your peaches for the fruitcake man.
Fuck you bitch.
C'mon man, didn't I do you right that time I give you the turkey loaf for the ham and lima beans shit.
Youse a pig man. I hope Manny get dat laundry gig for' you do.
De fool think he's gonna get it but he ain't known for his thinking.
Hey Taylor, you don't know it but I saved your ass today. I killed a shit-eating dog.
That reminds me, I gotta take a shit.
You gonna wipe your ass dis time?
Don babytalk him man. Cocksucker fell asleep. They walked right up on us, he don do shit.
Listen to that shit, that's good shit!
Fuck that redneck noise, dude. All dem chicks be rappin' how dey losin' der' ho's and how dey ain't got no bread for beer. Fuck dat honky shit. Got to get me some motown jams, dig it?
Whaddaya talking shit for man. Hey Junior! Y'ever smoke any shit?
Das right dude. You be tryin' to string de black man out on dat shit and keep him DOWN. Time's be coming, my man, when de black man's gonna throw off that yoke.
Say I can dig it. Smoke that shit everything kinda gets weird y'know? Y'hear that story the gooks is putting chemicals in the grass so's we become 'pacifists' so's we don fight Where the hell's everybody, they'se gettin high that's what - bunch of hopheads, they think they special...
Don you worry Bunny, youse a killer anyway.
Yeah but I still like a piece of pussy once in a while - ain't nothing like a piece of pussy cept maybe the Indie 500.
Youse so fucked up man.
Y'ever look at yoself in the mirror Junior, youse uglier than a dick on a dog man.
Yeah, you had a piece of pussy on a plate in front of you, you'd probably kill it.
Shit, I bet I been laid more'n you have.
Sure, you probably stick it in tween her knees and think youse there.
Yeah?
Come on you can do better than that!
You lame Taylor?
What?
Where's he from?
Does he have a metal plate in his head?
Baaa, got no time to go to the movies. Love and Hate too busy fighting for possession of my soul.
Where's Elias come from?
Taylor - get your ass over here. Move!
Yeah! I got two of them fuckers...
I got one...
Shit boy you been out in the sun too long. You try that, he'll stick it right back up your ass with a candle on it.
Then what do you suggest big shot?
Fuck this shit!
You guys trying to cure the headache by cutting off the head. 'Lias didn't ask you to fight his battles and if there's a Heaven - and god, I hope so - I know he's sitting up there drunk as a fuckin' monkey and smokin' shit cause HIS PAINS HE DONE LEFT DOWN HERE. Baaaaaaaaa!
I was wrong.
Taylor! Francis!
Rhah! What's going on. Rodriguez's hole just got...
La Dai! La Dai! GET THE FUCK OUTTA THERE!
Hey take it easy man. They're scared.
Where's Lerner?
Come on man!
Hey Taylor, you okay man?
Yeah. How 'bout you?
First time?
Yeah.
Feel good?
Yeah. No pain in my neck now. Feels good.
...But what'd she do?
But what'd she actually do?
Dawn! That was it!
...I can't sleep, why don't you get some sack time.
...don't feel like it either.
...beautiful night.
Yeah. I love this place at night. The stars... there's no right or wrong in them, they're just there.
Barnes got it in for you, don't he?
Barnes believes in what he's doing.
And you, do you believe?
In '65 - yeah. Now... No. What happened today's just the beginning. We're gonna lose this war...
Oh shit! Sometimes there's things in my head... man. Grass does that to me, fucks me all up like a crazy Indian...
Do you believe that stuff about... knowing you're gonna die?
I'll go with you.
Okay - got light duty, three days.
Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.
What you got there - beers?
How the fuck you get over here man, you look like you educated...
I volunteered.
You WHAT? Say 'gain.
You okay man? Neck botherin' you?
Nah...
No, thanks...
...you know that night we got hit... I...
Yo getting there Taylor. You be cool now and I'll introduce you 'round to some of the 'heads'.
What are the heads?
Three years, Jesus, he's crazy as Barnes...
Must be somebody?
...there's nobody.
You been smoking too much shit babe. Gotta control that. Takes a man down... I remember when you first come out to the bush, you was straight as a...
'People say I'm the life of the party cause I tell a joke or two although I may be laughing loud and hardy deep inside I'm blue...'
Y'ever get caught in a mistake King and you just can't get out of it?
Way out of anything, man. Just keep your pecker up, your powder dry, the worm WILL turn. How many days you short?
Not just me... it's the way the whole thing works. People like Elias get wasted and people like Barnes just go on making up rules any way they want and what do we do, we just sit around in the middle and suck on it! We just don't add up to dry shit.
Hey that's great King, that's great... you take it on home for me, you tell 'em King... got your address right? You know where you can reach men, man. Anytime!
...Motherfuckah, motherfuckah, I'm too short to be dealing with this shit! They keep fucking with us man, no letup...
Politics man, fuckin' politics. That O'Neill man got his nose so far up Top's ass he gotta be Pinocchio...
Forty-two days man and a wakeup and I'm a gone motherfucker. Back to de WORLD.
Broke a 100. Got 92 to go. April 17. DEROS man. California this summer. Waves are good they tell me, surfin's gonna be good...
You volunteered for this shit man?
What we got here a crusader?
Shit! Morehouse and Sal are short. Fu Sheng's going on R&R, you don't want to send their asses out on an ambush. You got the fresh meat Elias.
They don't know shit Barnes, and chances are we gonna run into something.
So what am I going to do! Get one of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the World can get his beauty fucking sleep!
Hey O'Neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know.
Excuses are like assholes, Taylor - everybody got one.
Tell Six we need engineers here, this pos. is crawling with traps.
Alright, Six says torch this place! Blow the weapons in place. Round up all suspected Vee Cees and shake it up! We ain't got much light left.
Why the fuck didn't you do something Lieutenant!
What are you talking about!
You know what I'm talking about!
Sounds pretty far out to me 'Lias.
Whatcha doing in the underworld Taylor?
Merle?
Whew! - where that come from?
Found it. Growing in a garden.
I know Barnes six months and I'll tell ya something - that man is MEAN, red in his soul like a dick on a dog.
He done a year in Japan in the hospital, then when he gets out, the first thing he done is re-up. Four years he been in the field...
The Good Lord works his revenge in strange ways.
Not the only man to meet his Jezebel either.
Then you jes gonna forget 'bout Elias and all the good times we done had? Right in here.
Right on.
And Baaaaaaa! back on you.
I didn't like it.
Tennessee someplace. Hill country.
Well he ain't normal that's fo sure.
I was home on leave y'know and everybody's just worried 'bout making money, everybody's out for themselves, they don't even want to talk about it man, it's like the fucking Twilight Zone back there - you wouldn't even KNOW there's a war on here. My sister says to me why you have to go there like I started this...
You wanted to see me sir?
Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.
Squad? I didn't know we was still referring to this platoon in terms of squads sir.
These two holes are yours...
Begging your pardon Lieutenant but my holes are far enuff apart you could run a regiment through there and nobody'd see them - I got five live bodies left...
I don't want to hear your problems, Jackson. You'll get new men any day. Time being you make do like everybody else.
Hey Lieutenant I didn't ask for this job, I...
I don't want to hear about it Jackson.
You don't want to hear about it?
That's right. I don't want to hear about it 'cause to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit okay... I just don't give a shit anymore.
Right...
No thanks, I've seen Seattle.
Same as an hour ago. Remember? I'm the steady type.
You could tell me your name. And where you're going.
How far does this train go?
Vancouver, B.C.
Or Reno? They always throw them off the bridge there, I've heard.
Perhaps I don't take it so lightly.
Where are you staying in Vancouver Royal. It's pretty crowded you know.
Is it? I expected to go to the Vancouver Royal. Should I have a reservation?
I'll make one for you. I live there.
Well..
A very small service. It doesn't even ask for thanks. How long for?
I really don't know.
Indefinitely?
I don't know.
Nice room. Balcony and everything. Lovely view too.
Very nice Mitchell turns.
No thanks?
Thank you.
Suppose I hadn't known that immigration inspector? Hadn't put in a good word for you?
I'm supposing.
I have a darned good idea you're name isn't Betty Mayfield at all.
Yes?
How about taking to Uncle Larry into the old firm? He's a useful guy to have on your side.

Dine and dance tonight? I've got fifty bucks to throw away.
Not tonight.
What's the matter?
I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.
We have some nice places around Vancouver.
I'm sure you have.
Well, how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o'clock? A friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there.
I haven't been invited.
Nobody gets invited to Clark Brandon's parties. They just go.
Perhaps I'd better get you straightened out, Mr. Mitchell. You've been rather nice to me, in a couple of ways. And I'm grateful. But I don't think this entitles you to put me on a leash.
The brush-off, huh?
Don't I even get my face slapped?
Would you mind?
Okay. You win.
If you change your mind about the cocktail party, or anything else, give me a buzz.
Betty, this is Margo West. She wants to meet you. Miss Mayfield.
I think I'd like to dance.
Please be a little more careful how you talk, Mr. Mitchell.
How careful should I be?
I don't like being referred to as babe, or addressed as baby. I don't like your possessive attitude, nor your hints of secret knowledge. In fact, to be very frank, Mr. Mitchell, I don't think I like you.
I think you're drunk.
What's the matter, baby? Don't you like being kissed?
Good evening, Miss.
How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?
I'm afraid there's nothing more tonight, Miss. Unless you charter a plane.
How long would that take?
Well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field, unless there's one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer...
Immigration Officer?
They might think I was running away from something.
Good morning. Can I do something for you?
I'm Miss Mayfield. Is Mr. Campbell here?
I'm Mr. Campbell, Miss Mayfield. Purely as a matter of routine, I want to ask the name of your bank.
Bank?
Merely for our records, Miss Mayfield. It's usual for the guests who come here for the first time.
You can have the table yourself, if you'd rather. I'm only killing time.
No, please.
Sit down then. We often have a double up here.
Your liquor laws..
A fellow named Brandon has a penthouse here. He's holding open house. I was up there. Too noisy. Bored.
I see.
It might be worth a Martini to you.
I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.
What did you say his name was?
Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my age. Lot of money... that he didn't make. Former American. Now naturalized in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect. Scotch superb.
You don't sound as if you liked him very much.
No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But.. If you really want a good dry Martini..
As I said before...
You're not paying for this. It's quite enough that you let me sit at your table.
I never pay for anything. They just keep me here to amuse the guests.
And do you amuse the guests?
No. Are you really going to drink that stuff?
You're drinking it.
I can be talked out of it. As a matter of fact, I'd like a dry Martini myself.
Would it make you anymore amusing?
Whatever you say.
I didn't say anything.
I don't know you and you don't know me. I made a reasonably polite suggestion. But I'm sure you'd rather be alone.
Neatly said...but to the wrong man. The trouble with pretty girls is that they can't imagine anyone thinking of anything else but the fact they are pretty girls. I get tired of it.
Do you think I don't?
Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.
You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?
Dance?
I know it's a littler late for an apology.
Much too late.
You said it wasn't a tragedy.
What's funny about that? If you pick up people like Larry Mitchell other people are bound to get funny ideas about you. The world is full of Larry Mitchells.
There isn't one.. That anyone would believe. I went for a walk after dinner, down to the ocean...alone... I came up and went to bed. I didn't sleep very well. Then there was a thunderstorm. And it began to rain. I went across to close the French door. That's the first time I saw him out there.
He got in here how?
No. And I've never fired a gun in my life, Aren't you supposed not to touch it?
They'll know whether he killed himself.
I don't.
How did you meet him?
On a train. He said he lived here, and he offered to make a reservation for me.
Nice of him.
He knew the immigration officer. He eased himself in.
He was a great boy for that. What else?
Go ahead...if you want to. It doesn't matter.
You tried to run away.
There wasn't any plane.
Want a spike in it?
There's one thing I may as well tell you. You'll find it out anyhow. I tried to run away--when I found him out there on the balcony. There wasn't any plane.
Bad?
Bad enough.
He could hardly help suspecting you.
What time is it?
Quarter after one. Why?
There's a lot of night left to live through.
So there is. You don't want to go to bed. I don't want to go to bed. Let's go somewhere and hear some music--have something to drink-- something to eat--even dance.
Dance? Tonight?
Let's not pretend Mitchell meant anything to either of us.
Certainly not to me.
Just who are you, anyway?
You, too? My name is Betty Mayfield. I was born, and I am here. Message ends. That's what I told him. He didn't like it.
Cold?
Is this the best you can do?
Want to dance?
Dance? Here?
Why not?
They know you here--know your name.
That man over there. He was in the hotel lobby.
I didn't notice him.
We walked right passed him. He's following us.
Killaine's not that sort of guy. He said no--he meant no.
Then he's got to be a detective.
Couldn't be.
Quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby?
Absolutely sure.
He's a fellow with a very hard knee, and he knows how to use it.
You don't know who he is?
He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.
He was following us--but he's not a policeman.
Us?
All right--following me.
Why?
No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.
Anything I can do about it?
Take me home--and forget you ever saw me. That's a silly remark isn't it?
It still doesn't matter if I kiss you?
Nothing matters.
That's the second round I've lost tonight. That fellow hurt me.
So have I.
It sounds like a fair location. Could you be a little more exact?
I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store. That man last night--the one that followed me--
Cant be too close for me. Right across the street from it suits me. Anything else listed?
There's another man--right outside the booth here. I never saw him Before.
I hated to go to that place. I almost went to the police station instead.
No percentage in that.
They're going to arrest me.
I know. Killaine has a warrant.
If you meant it, you wouldn't show it to me, Betty. Or am I supposed to deliver it to dear Inspector Killaine?
Wrote it in the waiting room of the Hudson Bay Store. With somebody's Pekingese trying to climb into my lap. Perhaps you're right. Perhaps I didn't mean it. All I know is that I'm licked.
There's a lot of water between Vancouver and the U.S.A. This note is a suicide note. After you're gone where would they look for you? Why would they look for you? Darkness, and open water, and a fast cabin cruiser. And I have a pocket full of money. And if I helped you, I'd be committing a crime, or so they tell me.
That wasn't why I called you. Why did I hope--when I hadn't any right to hope?
How bad is it? Bad enough for--
Take me where I haven't the courage to take myself.
How bad is the other thing? The secret?
This is the ace, Betty. But not of spades. They'll find out about the other. They might know already. And when they get this-- What would they look for? Where? Out there somewhere?
They'll look for you.
I run over to Victoria. Play some golf with some people I know. Do it all the time. That's why I have a cabin cruiser. Custom- built.Forty knots. Mr Clark Brandon an almost gentleman of almost complete leisure. Member of six golf clubs. Broke 70 once on the Shaughnessy Heights Course. You have to be good to do that, And if you look out
And Betty Mayfield--
Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere. Of course she might have run away--if she knew how. And where to go. She might have dyed her hair. Bleached it before probably. And changed her name again. But look at this note. And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there. Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run
But that's what I'm doing. Couldn't they think of that?
If they had any reason to. Why make it tough for themselves? Why go to all that trouble? Here's an open book. Close it. No reason to keep it open. She was a nice girl, anyway. And perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose. Perhaps she didn't kill the other one. You never know. Give her the benefit of the doubt. Leave her stay
Killaine...
You'll be safe here. I won't be long. Help yourself to anything you want. The galley's through there. You can make coffee if you like.
This must have cost a fortune.
It did, but it never paid off-- until now. I ought to be back within an hour. We can't leave until near dark anyway.
Do you have to leave the note?
I'd still go through--even if I ended up in jail.
You wouldn't like it. I've been there.
Well?
Killaine's wise. We can't wait any longer. Here, put this on. But stay out of sight until we clear the harbor. I'll tell you when.
See anything?
I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising.
Cold?
Frozen.
I decided I didn't want a drink...I'm beginning to wonder.
Wonder what?
If you're doing all this just for me.
That, and the fun of it.
I thought you had to be back to the hotel. To leave my--my note.
Funny, I never thought of you that way. You were so close too. We were all pretty stupid about you.
Including Killaine.
Including Killaine...I still can't think of you that way.
I told you my father died in jail. He stole a fortune. Most of it pretty dirty money. I don't care to have that known.
In a way.
If it was an accident, you could have told the truth.
So could you. But our records were a little against us.
What your father did doesn't condemn you.
Nobody believed I wasn't in on it. I was just a dumb-smart collage boy, and he was my father. I thought it was a legitimate business. He was a politician, with fingers in a lot of pies. I never saw the pies. They had names. For the record. Innocent names. You know where that kind of money comes from, don't you?
It buys things, just like any other kind.
That man that was following us last night--he didn't come back this morning. I'm beginning to wonder about him, too. Was he really following me--or you?
No. I paid him off.
He'll come back...They always come back when you give them money.
Not this one. And not Mitchell.
You-killed-him?
Magruder obliged me. No use my saying it wasn't planned that way. I had to clean up. I'm not a dumb- smart college boy anymore. Nobody in the world would believe I didn't plan the whole thing.
I guess I'm a little screwy. Maybe I could believe it. Should I try?
Don't go soft on me, baby. I've got your note in my pocket. You wrote it, all by your own self. And I have to use it. It has to be found in exactly the right place.
You'll never make it. You've out- smarted yourself.
It wasn't the time or place. Don't worry about the note, baby. I'm playing for my neck now.
And I'm begging for my life--and yours.
Mine?
Yes. Yours. You haven't murdered anybody. You killed Mitchell. Wasn't that an accident? It must have been. If you kill a blackmailer, you kill him dead--so that he can't talk anymore.
Mitchell was dead enough.
And that nasty man that followed us last night. You didn't kill him.
Who'd believe it but you? I took him out to sea and threw him in the water. Even if they find him, what connects him with me?
Magruder does.
You think Magruder wants to hang beside me?
But the next one is murder. First the little step, then the longer step , and then the step you can never take back. You could tell about Mitchell. You could tell about Magruder--and the detective. It would hurt, but you could do it. You could never tell about me.
Would I want to?
Every day of your life you'll want me. You'll never get over it. Every time you see your face in the mirror--
This is it, Betty. They'll find us again, fog or no fog.
If it has to be--do you mind if I do it myself? Oh, I don't mean with the gun. This is no trick. When I wrote that note you have in your pocket-- that was no trick either. It's not so hard for me as you think. I'm not crying about it, I've been skating close to it for quite some time. The water
Me?
I think you mean that.
Do you think I was faking?
Yes, Miss.
I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry, please.
Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law.
Beer? Well, all right.
Beer or ale, Miss?
Ale. I don't mind.
Mrs. West is a very emotional woman.
I don't know her.. or particularly want to.
You probably know the type. You find them in hotels and resorts all over the world. They always have clothes, and money, and usually have had three or four husbands. They dress and enamel themselves with great care. They worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes.. And they demonstrate their incompetence at the art of living bet
I was born in New York City. I grew up. And here I am.
I'll have to know a little more than that.
I'm sorry, that's all there is.
Please answer my question.
You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.
That's an evasion and you know it.
Well, that's not getting us anywhere. You won't tell me who you are, or give any account of yourself. You won't even give me your address in the United States. Why? Unhappy marriage?
Who told you I was married?
Your family coat of arms, Mr. Killaine?
Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
I'm sorry.
Stop saying you're sorry. I want information, not regrets.
What this?
Yes.
Where's you get it?
An unhappy marriage hardly seems a sufficient reason for that.
Why don't you arrest me and be done with it.
Good morning, Mr. Killaine. I'm sorry I can't give you the name of my bank--because I have no bank at the moment. That was a crude trick.
Care for a stroll outside? Beautiful morning. The air is like wine, the sky is a deep blue.
Deep blue? I'd call it grey-blue.
FLorida?
Down below's Stanley Park. On the other side of the trees, there's a beach. You can see it. Steveston's over there. Coast Guard station. There's the Yacht Club, and beyond it, the docks. The over on the other side of the inlet, there's Grouse Mountain. It's about 4000 feet high. There's a restaurant on top of it. Very nice restaurant. I'm sorry we couldn't
We wouldn't have met at all.
True. I was a bit irritable last night. I apologize.
You were a galahad, compared to some cops I've known.
You've had dealings with the police before?
Who hasn't--one way or another?
But not in the investigation of a major crime, I hope.
Is it a crime?
We're 98 per cent certain Mitchell was murdered. There are a lot of reasons. Was he very drunk when you last saw him?
You were there when I last saw him.
I'll find out, you know. Perhaps not today--perhaps not tomorrow. But in the end, I'll find out.
The police always do, don't they?
I wouldn't make you talk about it. My job is the death of Marry Mitchell. Why can't you give me your confidence?
You--or the Vancouver Police Department?
We try to be decent.
You won't tell me who you are? You won't even give me a chance to help you?
Nobody can help me. You, least of all.
If I understand what you meant by that.
You understand perfectly.
Then there isn't much I can do, is there?
This isn't a very good place to talk.
I don't want to talk.
I expected nothing else.
I might be able to save you. If I knew enough.
You wouldn't even try There must be some copper in you, or you wouldn't be an inspector.
I'm about to be very silly. A man passes a girl on the street--a very lovely girl--his eyes meet her eyes, and something reaches out and takes hold of his heart-- and then she goes on and is lost in the crowd--and he says to himself, "There goes my lost love"-- and it's true--if he never sees her again, it's still true. Of course,
Points very straight to her.
He looks at the girl, looks into her eyes--
What does he see?
Palm trees against a sunset--waves breaking on a coral reef--the Taj Mahal by moonlight--roses in an English garden, just after a shower-- Clichés, one and all--but good ones, with a lot of mileage left in them--there's one thing he does not see--murder--and murder was what he was sent to find. Pretty ridiculous, isn't it?
Very ridiculous.
That's my hard luck--I'm man enough to tell you about it--and not be sorry.
What do your friends call you?-- The ones that know you well?--and like you very much?
They call me Jeff.
Jeff. Shall we go now, Jeff, and get it over with?
Not quiet yet. We know who the gun belonged to. Margo West. She told us this morning. It doesn't mean much. Mitchell took it away from her. He had a habit of going through her bag.
Looking for peanuts, I suppose.
So Mitchell had handled it. Afterwards, Brandon picked it up. There's no indication you handled it.
I always wear gloves when I shoot people. A bad joke--but better than tears.
Time's up. I'm off the case.
They'll only find someone else-- who won't be so kind.
That's something I can't spare you. But I won't do it myself.
Because you think your in love with me?
You've got a couple of hours, maybe.
To do what?
I can't answer that.
What will they do to you?
That's they're business. Can I drop you somewhere?
What are you going to do--toss your job into Puget Sound? Because I make you think of magnolias? I thought policeman was something like a soldier. That his duty came first. However much he might happen hate it.
I've been a soldier too. There is a difference. A policeman, like a judge, has a right to disqualify himself on proper grounds.
What proper grounds? You can't be in love with me. You hardly know me. I'm not in love with you.
I know that.
But even if you were in love with me.
There's an empty taxi across the street. If you're so anxious, take it. He'll know the way to the police headquarters.
You do things the hard way, don't you?
Sometimes.
Not sometimes. Always. Just because it is the hard way. You're that kind of man, Jeff.
He could have killed me a dozen times. You'd never have known.
We know everything.
No, Jeff. You don't. He's not a murderer, I tell you. He;s not a murderer.
But I tell you---if you'd only understand.
Good morning, Mr. Brandon.
Morning. Any calls?
Mr. Reed would like you to call him.
All right. Get him.
And there's a Mr. Goble to see you. Says his business is personal.
Mr. Reed, please, for Mr. Brandon. Very well. Have him call. Mr. Brandon is in his office now. Mr. Reed stepped out, Mr. Brandon.
I'd like a few words with you, in private.
Nice friendly approach you've got. Goble. I could hardly walk when I got out of bed this morning.
You asked for it.
I'm still asking. What do you want?
I'm not sure I want anything from you. You might want something from me.
Name it.
Private eye?
You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding.
What are your rates?
$40 a day and expenses. Expenses run pretty high on a case like this. I'm a long way from home. I don't have a B.C. Licence. I'd need about $500 for a retainer.
What have you got on Miss Mayfield?
That's a nice hard knee you've got, Goble. How'd you like to trade it for a broken neck?
Quit trying to scare me, Mr. Brandon, I'm neurotic.
You hurt my feelings. I ought to raise the price to be a thousand.
If I call the police, your price will go down to a minus sign.
Bluff. You've waited too long.
For five hundred, what do I get?
I go home and paint the kitchen.
For two hundred?
I stick around and wait for the five hundred.
You mentioned information.
Sorry. Another client paid for that. You can hire me not to use it.
A thousand.
Got it on you?
Got the information on you?
There's two hundred. I'll meet you in an hour--where we met last night
Why not here?
I don't like your perfume in my office. Make it somewhere else if you don't like Charlie's.
Hi Margo. Hello Killaine. You two come together?
Let me introduce you. Mr. Killaine, Mrs. West.
What'll you have, Margo?
Martini.
You make friends quickly, don't you, Clark?
Sometimes.
And without much discrimination.
Leave that one lay.
I'm sorry. This thing has just knocked me silly. How long do we have to wait for this police character?
Until he comes. He's a nice guy. You've met him.
All right, let's see the buzzer.
What's a buzzer?
So you're not a cop.
Me a cop? What made you think that, Mr. Brandon?
Who told you my name?
How are your teeth getting along?
What's this in favor of?
What?
It goes with this... cold houses and warm drinks...the effete Englishman.
That's what I like about cocktail parties. Everyone is so perfectly natural.
How's life treating you?
The usual grind.
Round of golf Saturday?
Would it have helped if I'd knocked him down?
Hardly. Who's the girl?
Somebody Mitchell picked up on the train. I don't even know her name.
She doesn't look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train.
Thank you.
Where?
On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside the chaise, I picked it up. Don't ask me why. I ought to know better.
Could be.
I rather thought so. And before that, had you ever seen the gun?
It was lying where on the balcony?
Near his right hand. About a foot away. Perhaps more. Good heavens, one doesn't use a tape measure.
How about a cup of coffee?
How are you two getting along?
In case you want to have us followed.
I don't.
Time for a little chat?
If it doesn't take too long. Drink?
Thanks. Lovely view you have, haven't you?
I never notice the view after the first week.
I would. Fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap. Wonderful thing, money is. Remember what Somerset Maugham said about it ?
I wouldn't know.
"Money is a sort of sixth sense that gives meaning to all the others." Very appealing, especially to a poor man.
Could we discuss that some other time?
Sure. Let's discuss Betty Mayfield. How long since you saw her?
A couple of hours.
I have a warrant for her arrest.
That must hurt.
I've always thought you were a pretty nice guy, Brandon. I'd like to go on thinking so. If you tried to help her get away--
Would that make me a heel?
You'd be breaking the law.
Doesn't answer the question.
The only answer I have for you.
You passed up a dozen chances to arrest her. What toughened you up?
Information.
Don't kid me. You don't think she murdered Mitchell.
It could have been an accident.
That COULD BE TOLD.
Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.
And old man Clarendon? He had a motive, too. Margo and her money.
Mitchell was killed down here. How could Clarendon get in to do it? Or Margo for that matter.
How could Mitchell? After that act he put on up here, is it likely she'd let him in?
Mitchell was too drunk.
Or just drunk enough. He was with her when she registered. He knew where her room was. You were out most of the evening. There was a lot of mess to clean up . Waiters coming and going, the door standing open. Suppose Mitchell came in to grab a drink for himself, then wandered out on this balcony, then realized betty's balcony was just
Romeo in reverse. Uh-uh. No sale, Killaine.
You don't buy it. Okay. So I still want Betty Mayfield. Where is she?
No more for me, thanks. Remember what I said. I can't interfere with the law.
You forgetting the gag line, Killaine. The police don't take anything for granted.
I'm afraid they do. Far too often. So long.
You do a lot of real estate trading, Brandon?
Now and then. Mostly just for the fun of it.
I tried it once. I lost my shirt.
I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
I had a father who knew how to steal.
What?
You asked me where it all came from.
Hello, Mitchell. Having fun?
What's the matter, baby. Don't you like me anymore?
Lay off, can't you?
Do me a favor, Mitchell. Find yourself a nice secluded park bench.
Did I do something wrong?
I wouldn't know. Just do it somewhere else. There is such a thing as good manners.
How would you know, Brandon?
Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
Good afternoon, Mr. Campbell.
Mr. Mitchell.
A little something on account perhaps?
Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.
I think we'd better discuss this in my office, Mr. Mitchell.
I'm getting positively haggard. In a couple of years people will be describing me as well preserved.
So much less refined than frizzling them in the chair.
What are you doing here?
I don't think you locked your door.
What do you want?
See how easy it is? Perhaps Miss Mayfield left her door unlocked. Or if she didn't, there's a passkey on every floor in the linen room. The head porter has a passkey. The bell captain has a passkey. The hotel's full of passkeys.
Passkey?
Or--since one is a well-known and respected guest--one could go to the desk in the lobby and say "Miss Mayfield seems to have lost her room key--have you another"? They always have another.
Don't be a fool. I loved him. He wasn't worth it, but I loved him.
And now that he's safe from all other women, you can go on loving him.
You nasty, sardonic--
I'm a very observant man. You had something in your bag this afternoon, Something that causes you to hold it in a particular way. Something that made a particular sound when you put it down on the bar. You went out with Mitchell. None of us ever saw him again.
That's not enough.
I saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun. You lied. It was obvious.
He saw my face too.
So he did--but he hasn't told you what he saw. I have.
They'll arrest that girl. Everything points to her.
One of these days, you're going to wake up in the middle of the night and find that you've cut your throat.
How clumsy. I'd never forgive myself. Good night my dear.
You could have got in that room, just as you got in here. How do I know you didn't kill Larry?
With what motive?
Nastiness. You're nasty with words. Why wouldn't you be nasty with deeds once in a while? You hated him--and I know why.
Mr. Clarendon, have you ever seen this before?
I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know much about..
Recently, then.
No, Not recently. I'm sure of that.
I needn't keep you any longer, Mr. Clarendon.
The Harbor police have just picked up a dead man out of the water.
Floater?
Not a floater. Only just dead.
You're the waterfront specialist. Find out about it. I've got a murder to investigate.
You have two murders to investigate. This man's head was beaten in. And there's nothing in his pockets.
Drunk-rolling job. They hit him too hard.
I've been on the waterfront detail for twelve years. This man hadn't been dead an hour. He wasn't killed last night. He was killed today. In broad daylight. That's no drunk- rolling job.
And don't get too logical, Driscoll. In police business it doesn't work. I wish it did. But it doesn't
Got a moment, Inspector?
I've got a year. Or a second. I'm not sure which.
We've done that. He's a San Francisco private eye. Name Martin J. Goble, G-O-B-L-E. Had initials in his hat and for once he lived where he bought it. Goble and Greer is the firm name.
Swimming with his hat on? That's original.
If you'd seen the blood on his head--and some body had to carry him out to sea--
I understand. Pity to mess up a nice clean boat.
I got through to Greer, his partner in the detective business. Greer won't give out.
I'd suggest a telegram. Something like this: Chief of Police, San Francisco. A licensed private detective named named Martin J. Goble, address so-and-so, has been found murdered within our jurisdiction. His partner, name something-something Greer, refuses to give us any information. Correction. Refuses information necessary to our investigation. Can you assist? Signed Detective Sergeant Driscoll, Vancouver, British Columbia, Police.
Send that?
Would you?
Catch me at the Vancouver Royal if it's important.
The Super's just given me the sweetest dressing down I've ever had. I'm still reeling from it. And believe me, I had it coming. I apologize. What you think is important--I think is important.
Thanks, Inspector. What are your orders about this wire to San Francisco?
What's the face for, Driscoll?
Magruder's conked out. Adrenaline injections, oxygen tent. He may come out of it and he may not. As a source of quick information, we can't forget him.
I'm looking for Mr. Brandon.
I have an appointment with him, right here, right now.
Go live in a tent.
It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.
Mr. Brandon couldn't be here. He might have left something for you. What would it look like?
One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed. Not too fat- not too thin.
What do I get for it?
You get it's brother.
I need a receipt. Sign your name across the flap.
Open it and count it.
You in charge here?
So it seems Sergeant.
Right.
I knew him. He was easy to dislike, poor chap.
... I supposed you knew her, too, Inspector.
I've met her.
Pearl-handled .25 Automatic, uh? No, it's a Belgian gun... 6.6 mm.
This make of gun throws a shell backwards, high, and to the right. The chaise is only about four feet from the wall.
So the shell ought to have gone over?
Unless the gun was slanted up.
So the wound and the shell give you the same answer.
Right. A clean deduction from observed facts. They've got to be simple once in a while, Inspector.
She didn't seem the type to lam out--even if she got the chance. That stuff was all gone through last night. Anything special you're looking for, Inspector?
I'll know when I find it.
"G.G. Market one-eight-four-two."
Gigi, huh? Sounds French--one of those fancy ladies. Must have been very fancy, if he scratched her phone number in gold.
That's pretty risky business, Inspector.
Not too hard, is it?
Maybe we've been pretty dumb--
Was that about the right angle?
I think so.
Where's the shell?
You've got a dead man on your hands. You killed jim--even if it wasn't murder. What are you going to do about it?
If I've got any sense I'm going to call headquarters.
They'll probably believe you. But they'll want to know what you were fighting about. Why Mitchell had a gun. You'll tell them a simple story. They'll pretend it sounds all right to them. Now you're headquarters. How does it sound to you?
Before I took the story and closed the case, I'd want to know a lot more about these people. I'd want to know just about everything about them.
Exactly. Now I'm the killer. And there's something I don't want you to know. Something that would destroy my comfortable life, rob me of my friends, my position.
Such as?
Assume there is something to hid. I go to a lot of trouble. What do I do? What would you do?
Do I know who lives down there?
You can find out.
Do I know that she's out of the room? Likely to be out of it for some time?
You can find out the first part. The second part you have to take a chance on.
Pretty big chance, huh?
This is the shell. What about the gun?
Well. What about it?
I've handled it. Mitchell's handed it. If I wipe it off, no suicide. If I take it out and lose it, no suicide. If I leave it here....no suicide.
So?
How did he know he'd get the chance? He couldn't have arranged it.
He could have tried. If he was up there in the dark, listening, he'd know when she came home, know when she found Mitchell dead, know what she did about it. If she telephoned, he'd probably hear that.
And she did give him the chance, the way it worked out.
If she didn't--if luck was against him--he wipes the gun off, reaches the wall up there--drops it on the chaise.
No suicide.
Did we ever really think it was suicide?
You win, Inspector. You win all along the line. Why didn't we think of Brandon before--or did we-- some of us. Yeah. Of course you did. When a suspect thinks he's safe, you go on letting him think he's safe. Wait for a mistake.
Greer and Goble in the Call Building, San Francisco. Just like you thought...Two murders in two days. Different places, different methods, different people. Nothing connects them, but a telephone number.
Oh, the Coldstream Guards. Don't you take your hat off in elevators?
May you what?
Oh nothing.
Scotch and plain water, I think.
I never saw it before.
What about me?
You knew Mitchell pretty well, didn't you, Mrs. West?
I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains. Why don't you ask her about the gun?
I shall. From your knowledge of Mitchell, would you say he would be likely to commit suicide?
Anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. I've felt it myself.
Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?
I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her.
Remember that time, didn't I? Good morning Mrs. West. Does your visit here mean you've changed your mind?
How did you know? Clarendon. You cops never tell anybody anything, do you.
Other people always know so much more than we know--so much more than they're willing to tell us.
You couldn't possible have traced it this soon--not possibly.
Of course not. Thanks for telling me. I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.
I am a fool.
That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren't you?
Yes--and he's already becoming vague to me. Funny! Last night I was furiously jealous. Jealous of what? I out that gun in my bag deliberately. Who was I going to kill with it? A girl I didn't even know? A man I knew to be a thief and a forger? A half-man? A gigolo? It's already ludicrous. Love! What a comedy!
You didn't play it for laughs last night.
Did you ever have a serious operation?
Mortar shells are not funny, either.
At first, it doesn't hurt at all. That's shock. Then it hurts terribly--you wouldn't believe such pain could exist--and six months later you can't remember what pain felt like. It hasn't taken six months this time. It hasn't even taken twenty- four hours. Is that a beastly thing to say?
Not if it clears the air.
It does. May I go now?
I'll investigate Mr. Clarendon's financial position--
I don't understand.
Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.
Now, you're being beastly.
Sure. You didn't come here in person just to tell me about the gun. You wanted me to be looking across the desk at you while you talked about Mitchell. If I believe you, it would be psychologically impossible for you to have killed him last night.
And if you didn't believe me?
Yes, I think so. Here are two glazed manila envelopes. One is the bag type. The other one had the money in it. Don't ask me how I know. I know.
I'm interested in who handled it.
No doubt about that one.
How about Magruder?
He checks too.
That leaves two strangers.
So far.
Try Betty Mayfield. The Mitchell case.
Mayfield? She fit into this?
You'll have to take my word for it. We don't make slides until we have perfect prints for comparison.
This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon?
The card says so, doesn't it?
Killaine, this is Mr. Mitchell, Senior. Young Mitchell's father. He just flew in from Toronto.
I've explained the situation to Mr. Mitchell up to a point. Now about this Mayfield girl?
She's a suspect, naturally. But not the only one.
No.
I hear she's a very pretty girl.
Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
Am I to interpret that as an order to arrest Miss Mayfield?
Are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop?
A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
It won't look pretty good on your record, Killaine. Where's the girl now?
I don't know, sir.
Well, find out. Who's covering her?
This girl is a murderess, Killaine.
I disagree, sir. As Inspector in charge of the case I have the right to form that opinion, the right to act on it.
Ye have, have ye?
We lifted seven fairly good prints from Miss Mayfield's toilet articles. Washington ought to teletype us within a few hours.
And in the meantime this girl goes where she pleases, does what she pleases?
"Superintendent J. Mckechnie, Vancouver Police Department. Vancouver B.c. Replaying To Your E.P. teletype classification No. 2684 incomplete. We advise identification possible. Elizabeth Kinsolving, arrested Greenwater, North Carolina, January 8, 1948, on a charge of murder. Signed, FBI., Washington, D.C. H. Cleary, Inspector in charge." Have ye any comment, Killaine?
Identification on possible, Sir. Not conclusive.
"Physical description: Age 26, Height 5 1 3/4 inches: Weight, 188 pounds: Light brown hair: Deep blue eyes: Small, perfectly formed features: Ears and earlobes small: Slender build: Wears size 4 AA shoe: Quiet refined manner: New York accent: No charges pending. No prior criminal record. Mayfield, Mother's name. Air-mailing you photographs today. Signed Hubert Tollison, Chief of Police, Greenwater, North Carolina." She bleached
I think you'd be entirely justified, sir.
But you still think she's innocent.
I believe you won decorations during the war.
There are people in this world who don't think a police badge is a badge of honor. I'm not one of them.
Nor I. This is why I gave it to you.
You're a young man. You're romantic. You think a pretty face and a clean conscience go together. You think a soft voice means a soft heart. You'll grow out of that.
Not too far, I hope.
Get out of here!
What are my orders, sir?
I'm afraid you're not very glad to see me, Margo.
With your charm? How could I help it? Have a nice trip?
So-so.
Who's the girl?
Her name's Mayfield. Betty Mayfield.
Nice.
She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you?
Why should I mind?
You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly.
As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't easy. But you are helping me.
Margo, darling. You washed me up. Remember? We're just friends. You wanted it that way.
She's very beautiful. She's much younger than I am. And she's rich, I hope.
Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
You ought to know why.
I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.
I hoped to get enough to cover them before they cleared. I wasn't lucky.
You know what would happen to you if I turned these over to the police?
I have a rough idea.
You'd go to jail. For a long term.
What'll we do about it, Margo?
I've always been a heel. I guess I always will be.
You don't have to make a pose of it.
It's the only pose I have left. I'm sunk. Broke. I don't even have my hotel bill.
I seem to remember that you like to help yourself.
That's not very kind.
What's this?
What does it look like?
How long have you had it?
Years, why?
It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this.
You already have the checks, darling.
I didn't mean it that way I'm sorry.
Oh, forget it. Clark Brandon's throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening. Take me?
Of course.
How about your new friend?
I told you she's just..
A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again. Be back in an hour. Right?
Right.
I'm sorry. I forgot about calling for you.
It's quite unimportant, Mr. Mitchell. After all, you got what you wanted.
Be nasty.
I have no intension of being nasty, Mr. Mitchell.
She is beautiful. And young. No thank you.
You're very attractive, my dear. And you look very unsophisticated.
Mr. Penfield. I am sorry to have kept you.
It's kind of you to see me.
He's a little unhappy. I hope he wasn't a nuisance?
My first husband worked for the BBC. I doubt if anyone there remembers him now, just another long dead diligent administrator. He would have been useful in the fight to preserve the BBC's independence during the Suez crisis - one of the few things he was passionate about. I became involved too. I started work on a book that would have been published on
What a shame.
It wasn't much more than a pot boiler.Suez was very important for our generation. I didn't want it to be forgotten. And that's why I'd like to be able to help you. But really Mr. Penfield, I looked through my notes before you came, they're all very much out of date, there's been so much published since. I don't think I'm your man.
Well, I am a great admirer of your work. I read your books on Chartism when I was still at school. I'm a journalist, not a historian. There are questions of method, and approach. I wondered--
I see. Are you a socialist, Mr. Penfield?
Yes.
My husband apologises for not joining us. It's not too cold for you, Mr. Penfield?
It's fine, thank you.
Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?
Please do. I was beginning to wonder who this Mr. Penfield was.
To Ann.
To James. I remember what it was I was going to say. We were talking about forgetfulness. The Czech writer Kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting.
History books are first onto the bonfires.
Here I am lecturing you. Have some pâté.
So I can go ahead and be a historian without feeling like a poseur.I shall be fulfilling a citizen's duty.
If you like. But don't be too modest, James. The citizen's duty is to remember, not necessarily to write books. You are highly qualified. You're a responsible journalist doing what sounds to me like a very demanding job. Every day you take decisions that depend on your sense of history. A genuine tyranny would have to get rid of people like you.
You're kind to be so encouraging.
I do worry about Susan. Have you known her long? She hasn't mentioned you.
Actually, we've only just met. But we're quiet good friends.
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
Yes.
She'll be here next weekend. Why don't you come too, James? I'll * show you the marshes properly. If you're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from Siberia.
Well, I'd hate to be a nuisance.
Thank you.
The references are to Hansard or to newspapers. I haven't got the actual speeches now. You'll have to chase them up.
I will, thanks.
Hello. Anyone for a walk? Tom isn't, I can tell you.
Shall we go?
Then I began to listen to what the well-off were saying about the poor now  the war had just ended, and the language was much the same as it had been before the first Reform Act. A small minority thought that England was really theirs, they had made it, they owned it. The rest, the wage earners, were foreigners, outsiders intent on wrecking
Didn't Evelyn Waugh say that the country under Atlee seemed to be under enemy occupation?
Did he? I left school and worked for the Labour Party. My older brother, George, had just been killed in Greece, and he'd been an active member. I hero-worshipped him. He was 25 years old ... It was an exciting time for us, those first couple of years after the war. We thought the country was about to become a true democracy. I can
What went wrong?
Thank you.
Now first of all, tell us your name.
Penfield. James Penfield.
But I'm not an interviewer or a correspondent.
Give them here. This tells you how the Women's Peace Camp came to be set up. All local women at first, then we had support from women and men all over the country.
Terrific.
But what we need is national coverage. It's difficult with this Falklands madness going on. Do you think you might be able to do something when you get back?
Charles! I didn't know you were back. Have a good holiday?
Not too bad, thanks. How have you been?
Working hard on that book I was telling you about. Coming to the meeting?
I'm not sure I can face it.
How's Mary?
She's fine. Well, actually we've broken up. It's all over.
No. That's terrible, Charles. What happened?
Aha. James giving some woman the old heave-ho.
It's terribly good.
Committed to memory. Forever.
Attributed?
Of course.
Why, is there a new Foreign Secretary? Who was the old one anyway?
Congratulations. Who with?
I know, I know! Gentlemen, let me introduce you to one of our most talented contributors to The Cold War. James Penfield. He wrote the opening chapter, on 'The Berlin Airlift'. One of the best chapters in the book.
Hello.
Would you like a dessert...I'm having one.
No thanks. I'd like to break away--
I'll have some of that.
...break away completely from--
And some of that. Sorry.
Yes...You're not a socialist then?
No. I'd want to--
Good.
I'd want to set out events as they happened. The way I see it is this: the British Empire was an ideal. It may have become totally obsolete by the middle of this century, but it wasn't totally dishonourable to try and defend its remains and try and salvage some self-respect, which is what I think the Conservatives were trying to do. Then there's
Are you going to have coffee?
Yes, please.
And you'll join me in a sambucca?
Personally James, I'm very excited by this new arrangement we have. It gives us direct access to literally hundreds of American collages. Twentieth century history is a growth area over there, don't ask me why. Your readership will be first and second year American collage students...
Freshman and sophomores...
You know the lingo. Jolly good. So your language will have to be simple, not stupid, mind, but simple, very, very simple, and always remember it's an American readership.
James... I can't begin to tell you how pleased we all are. Congratulations, and I really mean it.
Thank you.
It's everything we wanted. A very good read. A terrific piece of work. So, here's to you and Suez.
So it's all worked out perfectly...
Was that your chapter, then? It was very good.
Thank you. We met last week, at the Wajda film. You won't remember. We didn't actually speak.
Can I give you a lift?
What did you think of that Wadja film?
I quite liked it. I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
I thought it was tremendous.
I think it went on rather too long.
I couldn't bear for it to end.
And I didn't like that man.
Oh, but he was terrific.
And the shape of it all. It was sort of...shapeless.
Really? I thought those long flashbacks were extremely good.
You don't like flashbacks because your mother's a historian.
Good theory. But I like my mother. I have no aversions to what she does.
Too bad. What did your father do?
Everyone describes the same process. At first it is exciting. You're at the centre of the world. As soon as anything happens, you're the first to know about it. And there are deadlines a dozen times a day, even more, and that's intimidating and exciting. Then you get the hang of it and the excitement wears off. Your a clerk in a rather dowdy
And you're at this third stage
No, there's a fourth. Numbness. You do everything right, but you feel nothing either way.
I think you're exaggerating. And if you aren't, you should jolly well change your job.
Oh yes?
Mummy and I, we were more like lovers, really, or sisters. Then a couple of years after Daddy died, and not long after I left Oxford, she started seeing various men and I was furious. I really was upset. I stopped going home. I never phoned. I went round telling everyone how awful her books were. And she hardly seemed to notice, and that
How nice.
It makes me weepy just to remember it. So we were fine again, and then she got married to Matthew who's a womaniser and a bit of a yob, but quite nice really, makes TV commercials. What about yours.
Both dead.
Damn. They're early.
Who?
I called you a taxi.
Very thoughtful.
Again?
Why not stay?
I have to be up early.
Me too.
Two or three years ago I would have stayed. And fucked you.
You don't trust me.
I don't trust anyone. That's what comes of working in television.
In radio we're different.
I might see you in Norfolk over the weekend.
I think we're ready now, thank you. And how was Norfolk? Did you get on with my mother?
I think she liked me.
Did she talk about me?
Do you think she's invited you up for her sake or for mine?
I haven't really thought about it.
I haven't seen much of you.
No. It's a bit of a madhouse. For some reason a lot of my mother's friends specialise in monologues.
Look, will you come on a walk with me tomorrow?
I might.
Might?
Jeremy phoned this morning
What did he want?
He's making plans for Brighton. He thought we could travel down together.
That'll be fun
In your car
Shall we have a drink or something?
We don't seem to get much time to talk.
Not here.
To the airlift.
To the airlift.
Any sign of the goddess Barrington?
Not yet you know any of these people?
One or two. A grey lot. Some social democrats. Some diligent anti-communists. A political section man from the US Embassy. And this exquisite Californian wine, courtesy of the CIA.
Blasé and epicene.
C'mon. I don't want any Jones about this.
Bastard.
To the Fleet.
To the Fleet.
And the Argies.
Now, top secret file.
Uh-huh. Tell me what you think of this first.
It's shit.
You approve!
Let me see.
Get way. You'll see when I'm ready. First I want you to reflect on my noble behaviour, on how your interests are closest to my heart, how I lay awake at night worrying--
Jeremy, just let me see what you've got.
You're so hard. All right then. I was chatting to some people from the diary page, and the name of Barrington came up. I expressed an interest...
Oh yes.
...an innocent interest, and found out that last year Vogue ran a series called 'Mothers and Daughters' Number seven, Anne and Susan Barrington. Being a decent loving friend I went to the files and made a copy for you.
Let me see.
She's never written a book in it, but she clearly knew a lot.
Mmm...
It's obvious what you have to do. Your way into the daughter's pants is through the mother, up the Suez canal...
You're so gross.
She's very nice, apparently. Lives in Norfolk. And very left-wing. You'll have to watch yourself there.
Ha ha...
According to this, the daughter goes up to stay quiet often. You'll need to get yourself invited for the right weekend.
You've really got it all worked out, haven't you?
That's enough of that.
We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.
What have you been up to?
Well, everyone's desperate for a new Falkland's angle. Purdy's come up with a real dog. Worker's rights in Argentina. So I've been running round getting people to do things. But no one's keen. Workers rights. When did anyone on that paper give a damn about workers rights? I said to Purdy, "Look, tits, bingo, jingo, horoscope, sport, celebs, gossip and the occasional firm stand
The torture of small children--
On the torture of very small children, but don't start telling them about their rights--
Hold those rights.
Fortunate that I was here to keep Susan entertained.
Sorry. Got held up. What are you doing here?
Delivering gossip and goodwill. It seems we'll both be doing Brighton. Perhaps you should come too.
Perhaps I will, then.
I'm off. Let's meet. You promised to tell me about Norfolk.
Still in love?
Six onion bajees! Great girl. Did you shake the mother off?
Yes, finally.
Big mistake, I think. You might have learned a lot.
Susan and I are very old friends, James.
Fuck off.
And you were obviously getting nowhere with her. I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that.
My God. You even cooked up that Norfolk trip.
It might have worked. Really. I would have been delighted for you if it had. But she wasn't interested. Not my fault.
You're a piece of shit
Hello.
Hello.
I'm waiting for your mother.
She said awfully sorry, make yourself comfortable, she won't be long. .
Thanks.
Why not sit down and wait?
Okay, I will.
She's not my mother, anyway. My mother's in Italy.
Oh, I see.
Have you come to talk about me?
What period?
Suez. 1956.
Do you want to hear my list of English Kings and Queens?
All right.
It goes from Henry VIII. Henry VIII, Edward IV, Mary, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles I, Charles II, James II, William and Mary, Ann, George I, II, III and IV, Victoria, Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII, George IV, Elizabeth II.
What about the Cromwells?
Wait...and with talks at the United Nations still making little progress, tension and anxiety settled on MPs of all parties in Westminster. Speaking on the Jimmy Young Show earlier today, Mrs Thatcher said the prospects of a peaceful solution did not look encouraging. What is it?
Not bad.
Fifteen news items. I got exactly the same running order as the bulletin desk. They're all old pros.
It's that lady from Norfolk again.
I'm not here.
I'm terribly sorry. He doesn't seem to be here ... No ... Yes, if I see him, I will. .. Goodbye. She's going to phone back.
Hello, Jimmy.
Dad.
So how is she?
Well, she doesn't complain much. You know what she's like. She keeps asking when you're coming...
I'm sorry about Saturday, Dad. It was just impossible to get away.
Everyone's been marvellous really, Jimmy. The neighbours come and sit with her while I'm at work.
That's good.
And Joe Ramage - do you remember him? He comes and helps out in the shop.
Yes, you said.
Now, are you going to have some more tea?
No, thanks Dad.
I've got to be going. I've got a meeting tonight.
The bed's all made up if you want to stay.
I just might give you a ring when we get back to London. There's one or two things I'd like to... Will you let me have your number before you leave? Have you ever watched a commercial being made?
No.
I'll tell you another thing. We might have led the world once into the Industrial Revolution, now we lead with television commercials. We're the best, it's as simple as that. Even the Americans will admit it now ... the camera work, the acting, the scripts, special effects. We've got the lot. Nearly all the good directors here have ambitions to make serious films. That
Yes.
What would you call it?
I dunno. Ploughman's Lunch.
Ploughman's Lunch. Traditional English fare.
U-huh.
Susan told me that your visits to Norfolk had ... well, an ulterior motive.
She said that?
You weren't really interested in Suez at all. Incredibly enough, you were interested in my wife.
Now listen...
Jeremy! How Fantastic.
Darling Susan.
You're so famous now.
And you're so beautiful. What are you doing here?
We're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools. World history since 1945. Twelve programmes, lots of stock film.
It was last year.
Darling Susan. You look like an angel. But where's your hat?
Oh no!
Don't point it at James!
What have you got there?
You'd look naked without one.
We'll see what we can do.
Promise?
It was incredible. He came back, made a pompous little bow and said, 'My dear girl you may film me all afternoon if you wish.' And he's promised not to talk to the Press.
It's because he desires you. The women get all the breaks at these conferences.
It's true! I was here last year doing a piece, remember? I was in the bar with all these Northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs. They were all incredibly fat and beery, huge trousers and braces. And so sweet. They all stood round me like children saying 'You! Working for television? You're just a young thing.' They wouldn't let me buy drinks even
Then one of them was sick all over your new dress.
Don't close the door. Don't turn out the hall light.
I won't. Goodnight.
Ah, Susy, it...
Don't you want to walk, Tom?
No.
Something happened. You got nuked in the last quarter.
Yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way.
And that's why you never went pro?
Two years of surgery. I missed my window. Limped through law school instead.
Mmm. A lawyer, huh? Too bad. But at least you're surfing now. So your life's not over yet, right?
Friends of yours, huh?
The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild. The other two always hang. They think they're some kinda death squad around here.
What's their program?
They're punks. Nazis. Their brains are wired wrong. They hurt surfing because they give nothing back, and they have no respect for the sea. They just want to get radical. It's mindless aggression. They'll never get it, the spiritual side of it.
You always talk like this? You're not gonna start chanting or anything are you?
No. So I was up the beach. I saw it going down. you didn't hesitate... they never backed you up an inch. That's rare in this world.
Thanks for stepping in.
Gonna be some people at my house tonight. Maybe you can make it.
Where?
Don't you gamble?
So what's the biggest? Waimea?
I gotta be fucking crazy.
Football's a man-made game. You keep score with numbers. But in this, there's no field, no rules, no opponent. Just you and the wave.
I know that part. Tell me something I can use, here.
I've watched you once or twice. You surf like it's some kind of street fight. You jerk along from moment to moment, fighting everything that comes at you. Always trying to win.
A flaw I'm working on.
The only way to win out here is to surrender. You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync. Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.
How you figure?
One shot stopping.
Ever done this before?
Once.
Pure adrenalin, right?! The ultimate rush. Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump.
Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--
It's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer. One last speedstar.
So, who... uh, who packed my chute?
I did. What's the matter? Don't trust me?
You gotta earn trust.
We gonna jump or jerk off?
Utah, you copy bruddah?
Whoooaaah! Shhiiittt! Whoooaaah!
You gonna pull?
Don't screw around man, pull it!
You do it... you first!
One thousand feet. Pull the goddamn cord!
You first!
What's this?
You're a fucking dead man--
Talk.
You call him... right now... and tell him to let her go.
We're wasting time.
I can't do this.
Sure you can! You may even like it... it's a killer rush. You'll see. Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?
Bodhi, this is your wake up call, man -- I... am... an... Eff... Bee... Eye... Agent!!
I'm not armed.
But you're not alone.
Where's Roach?
Around somewhere. Listen, I'm in kind of a hurry, Johnny U. What can I do for you?
You gotta tell me where she is.
And let my policy expire? Sorry.
Look, Bodhi man. People are dead. The ride is over.
I say when it's over!
Why should I?
Pretty radical, Johnny. Even for you. Why don't you pull it?
No games, Bodhi. Pull the cord! Now!!
Go on, Johnny. Pull it. But you gotta drop the gun, first! Right?! You use your other hand what you gonna hold on with?
Pull it right now or I'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself!
Three seconds... two... one...
Wild ride, huh?
And I always knew I could count on you, Agent Utah.
I'm not FBI anymore.
You never were...
Yeah? What?
Have you seen a little dog? Kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing. About this big.
You sure he isn't out back? You mind if I go take a look?
Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay--
Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him?
You know less than nothing. If you even knew that you knew nothing, at least that would be something, but you don't.
Eating solid breakfasts, Utah?
Sir?
All the food groups? Avoiding sugar? Caffeine? I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness. We stay off hard liquor, cigarettes...
This is us. Bank Robbery. And you're in the bank-robbery capital of the world--
1322 last year in LA county. Up 26 percent from the year before.
That's right. And we nailed over a thousand of them. We did it by crunching data. Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis. Nobody had to tackle a car once. You getting the signal, special agent?
You're a real blue-flame special, aren't you, Utah? I don't know why they sent you to LA. Must be an asshole shortage.
How was the beach?
Fine.
Surf conditions okay?
A little mushy.
A little mushy! You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?
Babes.
What?
Special Agent Utah, this is not some job flippin' burgers at the drive-in. Yes, the surfboard bothers me. Yes, your approach to this case bothers me. And yes, you bother me. You two have produced squat in the last two weeks, during which time the Ex- Presidents have robbed two more banks!! Do you have anything even remotely interesting to tell me?
Three men dead. One of them a cop. How's that sit in your gut, Utah?
They found the drop car up on Mulholland. I want you two to go work it.
What? Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
Cole and Munoz? I been on this case for two years.
That's the point, isn't it?
Yeah, I get it. Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?
Look, Harp. Don't turn him over to the uniforms like some punk. Let me ride him in.
Harp, let me tell you something. I was an agent in this bureau when your mommy was still wiping your shinny pink ass, and you know one thing I learned in all those years that you still haven't?
Added to which indignity, I got three months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue-flamer fresh out of Quantico for a partner. Some quarterback punk, Johnny Unitas or something.
Pappas. Angelo Pappas.
Punk. Quarterback Punk.
Good move.
They don't go for the vault?
Never go for the vault. They never get greedy.
Smart. You burn time in the vault.
Surgical. Look at them separate the dye packs. Dick and Ronny know their jobs.
You through, Mr. Wizard? Let me know if you find Jimmy Hoffa under the seat while you're at it. Hell, it's only 7:30. The night's still young... you can solve this case and start on another one.
Well, what're your ideas on these guys?
Forget about it, kid. They're ghosts. Let the goddamn yuppie Mormon affirmative action assholes handle it. See I'm almost 55... so I must be senile, right? They better get me out before I start pissing myself in public. Drooling. It would look bad for the Bureau, right?
So you're gonna coast to retirement, when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity.
Sorry.
Yeah. That was thirty years ago anyway. L.A.'s changed a lot since then. The air got dirty and the sex got clean. So you want to nail the Ex- Presidents? Be a big hero?
Yeah. What's your theory?
Oh well he must be a surfer.
Candle wax. Car wax. Mustache wax? Could be anything. Guy's waxing his mustache at the beach. Gets sand in it. Wipes it off with a shoe. Shoe scuffs the counter.
Sex wax? You're not into kinky shit, are you Angelo?
Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.
... Four months. June to October. Mmmm...same the year before.
Johnny, it's the only way.
They're like some kind of tribe. Got their own language. You can't just walk up to these guys. You've got to get out there. Learn some moves. Get into their head. Pick up the speech.
Angelo, this stuff is for little rubber people who don't shave yet.
I think you gotta hit them straight on!
What, you couldn't have just left the thing in your car?
It sticks out, so I can't lock it. Look, Angelo, you think I joined the FBI to learn to surf? This was your lame-o idea in the first place. You gotta back me up on this.
Angelo, pay attention. There's gonna be a test afterward. Lab is showing traces of toxins. PCBs. Heavy elements... selenium, titanium and arsenic.
The beaches are always being closed because of waste spills, right? And surfers are territorial. They stick mostly to certain breaks. If we can get some hair samples, and get a match to a certain beach, we'd know which break the Ex-Presidents surf. You buyin' this?
Big zippo so far. How about you?
No, but there are four guys back there you might check out.
Look, if you're gonna go leavin' your piece and your shield in the car, you can damn well stay in sight. Okay?
... Felony B and E, three months in juvey. Better. Felony assault. Postgraduate work at Chino. Excellent. I'm lovin' it. What about the brother? Great! Another model citizen. These guys really fit the profile.
When did Harp say they'd have the warrant?
Did that worthless punk partner of mine ever show up?
I'm ready to rock, Angelo. Where you want me?
Cole and Munoz are going in the back door. Babbit is backing me. So I want you at the side window by the hedge. You're strictly backup, got it?
Got it.
Aw shit.
Johnny! Uh, you, uh... should call first, you know? Hey, where the hell were you all day? You gotta at least call in or something. You okay?
... so I started tailing him.
This Zen master surfer.
Bodhi, yeah. I'm on him all day, right. He goes here, he goes there, he goes to Tower Records and buys come CDs, he has lunch at Patrick's Road House... ... he goes into the Assured Trust Savings and Loan.
Did he rob it?
Cute. He was inside for about 20 minutes. The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck. They were scoping it out, right?!
Yeah, or cashing a check.
Wait, wait. Then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit. Load it in Bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit. You see? Summer's almost over. They're splitting. They're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow. The next day at the outside latest. I got a feeling.
Last time you got a feeling I had to kill a man, which I always hate because it looks bad on the report.
They're on their way to Maui.
I say we call it in. Get some backup. But you gotta do it. Harp won't listen to me.
Sure. No problem. I'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious. Shit, he'll probably call out the National Guard.
I say we don't call it in. Under no circumstance are we to call this in.
Time for lunch.
Angelo, it's eleven thirty.
The hell are they?!
They took a left at the next light!
Nothing?
I know where they're going.
Angelo! Don't fire!
Kid, get outta the way!!
What do you want?
Shrimp and fries.
I mean, what do you want? What are you doing hanging around here.
I need you to teach me.
Gimme a break. One shrimp and fries to go! Anything to drink?
I'm serious.
I can see that. But forget it. Stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at. Miniature golf. Here, your number's 37.
What is it? You all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing? This is a line, right?
No, no. See, all my life I've done things for other people. In high school I played football because my old man expected me to. Then my parents always figured I'd go to law school, so I did. Football scholarship. Graduated Phi Beta Kappa--
This gonna take long?
I came out here from Ohio a month ago. Never saw the ocean before. I didn't think it would effect me so much. Like I'm drawn to it, or something. I want to do what you do. It's the truth.
Stop here. Do you agree to do exactly what I say when I say it?
Nice place.
Who's the girl?
Catch of the day.
Oh, oh. That sounds personal.
People are expendable to Bodhi.
Meaning you were expendable.
We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them. But you can't hold it against him, he's... different.
Sure, he's "the Bodhisattva".
Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. I hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies.
What are you talking about?
What's goin' on?
I can barely do this in broad daylight.
You had enough?
Look at you.
What?
Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you. See, it's gone. If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy.
I... I don't know. I can't describe what I'm feeling.
Those are cold.
I... I gotta go.
Johnny... what's going on? I don't get it... did I do something?
Ouch.
Betadyne doesn't hurt.
So what'd the other guy look like?
Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.
Jesus Christ, Johnny -- you've been using me! Your jacket's on the floor in the bathroom -- this goddamn thing's half out of the pocket... Oh God, it's all part of some case, isn't it?
Tyler, put the gun down.
I work bank robbery. Guys I'm after are surfers. I needed you, at first, but not--
Well, I saw you and--
Hey! Uh, how do I get back in?
Carefully, tough guy. Very carefully.
My name's Johnny Utah!
Who cares!
Bye.
Major, looks like there were ten, maybe twelve guerrillas. Looks like they took some prisoners from the chopper. Then a different set of track, over there.
What do you mean?
Strange, Major. There was a firefight. Shooting in all directions.
I can't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush.
I don't believe he did, Sir. I couldn't find a single track. Just doesn't make sense.
Billy... What the hell's wrong with you?
You've been pushing too many Pencils, Dillon. Had enough?
No way, old buddy.
That piece of work you guys pulled off at the Berlin embassy last week was really something. Blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat. Beautiful.
Like the old days, Dillon.
Wasn't my style. We're a rescue unit, not assassins. This must be good. Big shot from the CIA, leaves his desk to come back to the bush. What's so important?
Those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world. They're about to get squeezed. We can't let that happen. I needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet... no screw-ups. I needed the best. The best. So, I pulled a few strings at the State Department... and here we are.
Our rendezvous points and radio freqs. are indicated and fixed. AWACS contact on four hour intervals.
Who's our back-up on this?
No such thing, old buddy. It's a one way ticket. Once we cross that border, we're on our own.
You don't know how much I missed this, Dutch!!! Once you get this in your blood, you never get it out!!!
Billy's on it. Heat seeker. Pretty sophisticated for half-asses mountain boys.
Mean anything to you?
I knew this man. Green Berets, out of Fort Bragg. What the hell were they doing in here? You got any answers for this, Dillon?
Jesus... this is inhuman. Uh... I wasn't told of any operations in this area. They shouldn't have been here.
It was all bullshit. All of it. From the start... you set us up, got us in here to do your dirty work.
That's right, I set you up. You're a veteran at this, Dutch, I had to.
Why us?
Because I told you, you're the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story.
What story did you give to Davis?
She's too valuable. She's got to know their whole network. The whole set up. We take her with us.
Blain... ... Just like the others... no powder burns, no shrapnel.
We're still too far in, they won't risk coming in for us.
Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them.
I can accept that, it comes with the job.
You're wastin' your time.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
We're going to need everyone.
What are you talking about? We'll be out of here in ten minutes.
We're not going.
He'll be looking for the trip wires. If we're lucky, he won't see this.
No way, Dutch. I'm going. You get these people and get the hell out of here.
This isn't your style, Dillon.
Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch. Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right. Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along.
I'll see you there.
Thanks.
Don't know, only saw one of 'em. Camouflaged. He was there... ... Those fucking eyes...
What, Sergeant?
Take a position over there. I'll work around towards you. When I flush him, you nail him...
... Right, I got a score to settle for the Bro...
Any sign of the hostages?
What's got Billy so spooked?
You saw what?
Put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back. We'll bury him in the morning.
We've got most of the flares, frags. and two claymores just outside. Nothin's comin' close to here without trippin' on somethin'.
I'm sorry, Bull. It's never easy. He was a good soldier.
You're looking well, Dutch.
That's over the border, General.
What have you got in mind, General.
You lift off in three hours. There's one other thing.
What's that, General?
Took 'em out with a heat seeker.
There's something else, Major...
Mmmnnn...?
What's he got?
Major, you'd better take a look at this.
Hawkins?
What in God's name...?
I think it's Hawkins.
Where the hell is his body?
How could anyone get through this, carry Blain out, right under our noses without leavin' a trace?
He knows our defenses.
Georgia.
No wonder. For starts, you should know that hot pants are <u>horrid</u>, even when you do have the legs to carry them off. What are your plans while you're in town?
Well... I might be going out to dinner.
You'll want a cocktail dress then. Turn. You have a beautiful figure. A little too out in the open but simply lovely. Size six? Do you need shoes?
I dunno. Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?
Your uncle will like this.
He's not really my uncle.
Mr. Harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock. We also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share.
We're on the verge of closing a large navy contract. Double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares. We would give you a promissory note...
There's no way you could know that.
We can reach an understanding on this.
I don't think so. You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
Do what you have to do. I don't take it personally.
I like your hat.
Huh? Oh... yeah. S'okay? Uhm... how're... business things going.
Let's not talk about it, it's too depressing. Come on, I'll show you Thunder.
Please, we hardly know each other.
Hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet? I am. This is Vivian. You two been together long? You and Edward?
No.
It's... it's not like that.
You don't know anything about me.
What's that long building over there?
Storage, I think.
The real estate possibilities are endless. Most of the yard we'll just level. I talked to a couple of developers, under the table, of course, and they said --
You what?
Congratulations, sir.
What?
Who are you going after next, sir?
What would it take to buy our stock back? Name your price.
Mr. Kross, I'm not here to sell you my stock. On the contrary, I'm here to buy yours.
You've got a lot of nerve.
No. What I have is a lot of money.
I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing. Even the pension funds are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks.
What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.
I don't question the legality of what you do. It's your morality that makes me sick. I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.
Mr. Harris.
How are you, Mr. Kross.
Yes. I'm here to tell you that I've reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer.
<u>Expected</u>... offer.
Of course, yes. After the <u>expected</u> filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid.
Stop. For just a moment. Mr. Kross, I'd like to ask you a few questions <u>before</u> you sign. You realize that you're a target. If you weren't mine, you'd be someone elses, correct?
Yes.
I... I would take advantage of it.
I... I don't know. There... there wasn't time...
Quiet. Would I get the loans?
This time I imagine you would, yes. Hmm... With all this in mind, Mr. Kross, I can't logically make a formal bid on your company, can I?
You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr. Harris.
Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?
What's that?
You looking' for some company?
Uh, no. How do I get to Beverly Hills?
What? You gonna tell me you're lost?
Yes.
No, you look like a hooker.
Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.
Good. Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
Sure. For five bucks.
That's ridiculous.
The price just went up to ten.
Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
Sit... and spin.
Nice car. Yours?
No.
Stolen?
Mind if I turn on some heat?
Very good. You're obviously mechanical.
You're not from L.A., huh?
New York.
What motel you staying at?
<u>Ho</u>tel.
Okay, what <u>ho</u>tel?
Regent Beverly Wilshire. I bet you know it.
What's your name?
What do you want it to be? Vivian, my name's Vivian.
You like being a hooker, Vivian?
It pays.
So do day jobs.
Must be dangerous. Hooking.
Tell me about it. L.A. is suffering from a wacko epidemic. And who knows where half the guys I pick up have been. I mean, I use condoms. Always. And I get checked out once a month at the free clinic. Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I'm probably safer.
Very good. You ought to have that printed up on your business card.
If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.
Ugly habit, biting your nails.
What do you charge for company, Vivian?
Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
For the whole night?
For an hour.
You're joking.
I never joke about money.
No, but it's getting there.
Vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night?
Three hundred.
Fine.
What's your name, lover.
Edward. My name is Edward.
Get in. This side.
What?
Better believe it.
My raincoat's in the back. Put it on.
Why?
You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
You mean they don't have hookers.
Every place has hookers, but if this hotel has hookers, they don't look like they're...
Off the boulevard.
Room service. What do you drink?
Diet coke.
Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne.
Can I have some chips?
Want to know something? I don't quite know. I hadn't planned this.
Do you plan everything?
Always.
Well, the meter's running, it's your money. Speaking of which, cash'll do. In advance.
Let's talk some more first.
Right. So! In town on business?
Uh-huh.
Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.
And why do you say that?
Sounds like you've known a lot of lawyers.
I think he wanted you to tip him.
Where are they? Shopping together?
It's a very good year.
Try a strawberry.
Why?
Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.
Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
You really are a very beautiful girl.
Just a romantic, that's you.
What do you like?
Good morning.
You didn't wake me. I'll be out of here in a minute.
Did you sleep well?
Yeah. Too good. I forgot where I was.
Where'd you go?
I took the couch. I had some work to do. About last night...
Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside myself.
Mmm, I could tell.
I just hope it was worth three hundred bucks.
Do you ever... enjoy it?
I like guys if that's what you're asking. Not that I trust'm.
No? Why's that?
I buy companies.
The one I'm buying this week will cost around 150 million.
So what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm?
I sell them.
By breaking up a company's assets --
What are assets?
Vivian --
C'mon, I might buy a company some day.
Assets are anything of value a company owns. Sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole. By selling them off, I make a profit.
Sorta like stealing cars and selling'm for parts, huh?
Not... quite.
There, see? Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.
Where'd you learn to do this?
I fucked the debate team in high school. Tsk. I had a grampa. He liked ties on Sundays. You mind if I take a swim in your bathtub before I hit it?
All right. How much for the week?
What?
It'd cost you.
Of course. How much?
Four thousand.
Vivian, may I point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only 1,500.
But you want days too.
All right, two thousand.
Three.
Done.
I'm not just talking about sex.
Look butthead, I'll treat you so nice you'll never want to let me go, okay?
Never answer the phone. Ever.
Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.
Did you buy some clothes?
I got a dress, yeah.
Just one? Christ... I hope it's appropriate.
It's very tasteful. I think you'll especially like the zipper in the crotch. I'm -- joking.
Let's hope so. You'll get some more clothes tomorrow. I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp. Got it?
No, I don't "got it". Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date.
This isn't a date.
Go by yourself then. Where you taking me anyway?
The Rex.
Any good?
I think you'll approve.
... all right. I'll meet you in the lobby. But only cause you're paying me to.
Hello?
I thought I told you not to answer the phone.
I'm sorry.
And that's the way the game is played.
You're upset, huh?
Upset. No. I never get upset about business.
You liked the guy, though.
Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant. It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive.
Know what we're gonna do in a little while then? We're gonna call Domino's and have'm deliver a bigass pizza. We're gonna eat it in bed. We're gonna veg' out and watch television.
Television?
Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound. You don't have to use your brain at all.
I have work to do.
I still don't understand why you only bought one dress.
I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be.
Why not?
Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you? It works.
Was someone rude to you?
I had a little problem in one store. I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say. I don't belong there. Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget. She was cool.
Okay.
Good.
I thought maybe you'd like dinner.
Thank you. I would. Nice.
Wait till you see what I have on underneath.
What about dinner?
You always been rich?
No.
Seems like it. I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?
Keep talkin'. I like hearin'.
You still mad at'm?
You're really pushing it, bringing me here.
I think it's exciting.
What id we run into someone I know?
I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard.
Real genuine guy.
He's good at what he does.
You could freeze ice on his wife's ass. She anything like your ex?
Edward, these women here, I don't think any of'm like the guys they're with. They're just into it for the money.
I'm sure that's true for some of them.
I thought I was the pro. These women make me feel like an amateur.
You asshole! I can't believe what a --!
Clean the slut up, take her out, huh?! What are you trying to prove!? I'm not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends!
I don't know what you're talking about.
I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
Would you please calm down. Tell me what happened.
What was I supposed to do? I told the truth. Why should the truth upset you? It's not as if you're from a convent.
I want my fucking money. I'm getting out of here. I don't want anything more to do with you.
Can we talk about this? Can you just try to calm down?
Well, it's true. Just pay me what you owe me and I'm gone.
Vivian...
Pay me! Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in.
Fine. I'm only here a couple of more days and I'm not going to spend them fighting with you.
Fuck off.
Vivian... I'm sorry. I wasn't prepared for questions about us. It was an idiotic and insensitive thing I did. I should have known that it would hurt you.
I'm not hurt. It doesn't hurt you when somebody pisses on you, it just pissed you off.
Do I look okay?
What's that?
Edward, I can't.
Shush. Of course you can.
What if I lose it?
You won't.
What if someone tries to steal it?
You don't want to go all the way to San Francisco in a limousine, do you? I don't.
Where are you taking me!?
To meet some friends. Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker...
Huh?
I've never been on a plane before.
Sorry. You're not paying me to ask you question like that.
Vivian. I'm paying you to be you. Be you. Have you? Ever been in love with anyone?
You mean, besides Elvis? I'm a human being. Sure. Once. First time I ever ran away from home, I got as far as Atlanta. I met this boy. He'd been with his parents on their way to Chicago. They stopped at a gas station. He went to the john. When he came back they'd split. We sorta started looking out for each other. Aw,
If it's in Italian, how will I know what they're saying?
I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you. But you'll be surprised how much you understand. The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
But don't they have it in English?
If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, I'm not sure I'd have believed you.
I more than liked it.
I know. I'm glad.
Did you?
One more night and you're finally rid of me.
Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take.
What else? You gonna leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town?
It wouldn't be like that. I want to get you off the street. You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that?
Vivian, I've thought about this a lot. This is the best solution.
Vivian, life's not a fairy tale.
I know. Hey, don't mind me. I'm being stupid. I'll think about it, okay? It's a real good offer for a whore.
I've never treated you like a whore.
What did you do to him?
What do you mean?
Last time I saw him he was this strong guy. Now he's beaten. And you <u>liked him</u>.
Vivian, I want you to listen to me. The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.
Right.
It's not your concern. It's... business, that's all.
Business.
Yes. The man made a business decision.
It's all just business to you. Him. Me. Your life. Everything's business.
Why do guys always know how to hit a woman? Right across the cheek, wham, so it feels like your eye is gonna explode. What do they do, take you all aside in high school and show you how? It pisses me off!
Not all men hit. And no one is going to hit you anymore.
Right. You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'? I heard what you did with Kross.
I got tired of hating my father.
It was good.
You're packing.
Aw, don't... no...
Stay with me tonight. Not because you're being paid to. Stay with me because you want to.
I didn't think so.
Vivian...
Barnard Thomas, manager of the hotel.
Of course, yes. If you'll excuse me just a moment --
I have a message for you from your "niece", sir.
My what?
Mr. Harris, a guest of yours, is a guest of ours and shall be treated accordingly. The young lady asked me to tell you that she is waiting for you in the lounge.
Good afternoon, Mr. Harris.
What's up, where you going?
Give me your car keys, will you, I'm going back to my hotel.
At least stay for a drink. This party's for you.
Listen, there're some major local talent inside just dying to meet you...
Really? Some high class gold digger who speaks French better than I do? No, thank you. I just got off the phone with one.
Cynthia's not coming?
Love this car! Is it new?
I want to.
Edward, if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the Wall Street Journal.
I'll see him alone. Everyone knows you're my muscle. We'll make it social. Tell Kross I'll meet him for dinner. Tonight if you can arrange it.
You shouldn't go alone. He might claim that you tried to black mail him.
Bill, we're businessmen, not the damn mafia. I'll see you in the office. By the way, about your car...
Oh, god, what?
Edward, did you hear me?
I'm here.
What!?
What time's diner tonight?
Eight o'clock. Kross is bringing his son. Very bright kid, watch yourself with him. Who's this girl you're taking?
Goddamit! Where is he getting the money to fight?
Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
Put the pension funds on hold until I say otherwise.
We're letting them slide?
I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.
But, Edward...
Excuse me for saying this but what is wrong with you this week? First, you go soft on the pension funds. Now, you're giving him the chance to get away? As of two minutes ago, you are committed to the tune of over fifty million dollars --
Come on, Bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved. It's my money.
Bill, I'd like you to meet Vivian.
Fill me in on this. How'd you and Vivian meet?
We just did.
Come on, you can tell me. I sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this.
The night I left your house, I was lost. I was looking for directions.
And you just happened to run into her. Great. What's she do? She work?
Yes...
Doing what?
Vivian's in sales.
Why do you want to know?
She met him at dinner last night... I like this tie.
So now they're best friends? Edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now I see her talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy. It's too convenient.
You're being ridiculous.
Industrial espionage is not ridiculous. Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?
This is no time to disappear. We're in too far.
Bill? Stop panicking. Kross isn't going anywhere and I don't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down. I'll be in the office tomorrow.
Promise me you'll read those contracts by then.
Did I wake you?
I'm up.
I had to call. I jus got off the phone with James Kross. Get this. He wants to see you. Today.
Why?
He wouldn't say. Edward... I think we got him. His nuts are on the block and <u>we got him</u>. You there?
Give me twenty minutes.
I don't think there's any sense in --
Oh, my god... Edward, no!
I suppose you'd use them as collateral on new loans, wouldn't you?
What!?
You broke my nose.
I think I broke my hand. You're fired.
Edward, we've been together ten years.
And I don't like what we've become. I'll cover any losses you have on this one. Now get out, you asshole!
All this because of that whore!
You spent it on drugs, didn't you?
Carlos had some great rock.
We worked for that money. We were gonna put together enough to get out of that dump we live in, get off this street.
I just saw somebody pulled out of a dumpster. I wonder how much she made tonight?
Don't be mad at me. I'll pay you back. I promise.
I thought you were giving up that drug shit.
I will. I'm trying. Meanwhile I got some crack left, you wanna get high?
No, let's go to work. Okay?
Looks slow tonight.
Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --
I can't handle this tonight. I'm going home.
That crack is burning a hole in your pocket. There isn't even milk in the fridge. The rent's due. Now come on --
Hey, hey -- There's a rent.
'Lo.
Kit! Where've you been?
I was asleep. You woke me. You okay?
Kit, listen, the guy last night, the one in the Ferrari, I'm at this hotel, the Regent Beverly Wilshire, it's this absolutely unbelievable place and he's hired me for a whole week and Kit, listen, he's paying me three thousand bucks! We can get out of the apartment. We can get out of this town. We can do anything! Kit? Hey, you there?
He... he just does.
I'm sorry, Viv'. Carlos has been on my back. Did you get the money up front like I taught ya'?
Three hundred for last night and he gave me extra to buy some clothes. Now listen, I'm gonna leave an envelope for you at the front desk. Give me two hundred to the scum bucket and the other hundred to that asshole landlord for part of the rent. Spend it on drugs and I'll pull your hair out.
I'm getting dressed now. I'll be over. Bye.
Hey Kit, where do I go for the clothes? Good stuff on <u>him</u>.
In Beverly Hills?
Yeah.
Yes, I'm glad you're clean but I've been calling and calling.
Was that you?
Who did you think?
Carlos. I still owe him two hundred bucks...
Kit, I left that money for you days ago.
Kit...
Everybody keeps starin' at me.
Yeah... I know what you mean.
What do you know? You look <u>good</u>. All dressed up. You clean up real nice. You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard, lookin' like you do. Not that you ever did anyway.
You think I fit here where they just about chew your food for you?
I kissed him, Kit. On the mouth.
Honey, you're not supposed to do that.
I know. I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real.
Oh, my god, you mean it was good?
It was great.
Dummy.
He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money.
I pray for that.
All I'm doing is feeling lousy about it. I don't know what to do. What do I do, Kit?
Go for the bucks.
I don't care about bucks. I might love this guy.
So whatta' you going to do in San Francisco?
Get a job and probably go back to school. Figure out what I'm gonna be.
What kind of school?
School, school. Regular. I used to get pretty good grades in school, you know.
Want a pair of boots?
You sure you won't come with me?
Couple a hours.
Yeah. Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy.
Cool your jets a second. Here's some money.
No. You took care of rent, that's enough.
I want to. For food, got it? Eat something before the wind blows you away.
Yeah, what?
Rent. You're late.
Don't give me that. Kit gave it to you yesterday, cash.
Kit give me nothin'.
You bullshittin' me?
Housekeeping. I come to turn down the bed. 5:00, I turn down the bed.
<u>Housekeeping</u>. I come to turn down the bed.
Is that all? You just fold back the bedspread?
I also place las chocolates on the pillow.
Oooh, I love those.
I leave extras, miss.
I'm just going to my room.
You're a guest here?
I'm -- I'm with a friend.
And who is that?
What's your name?
Vivian.
Niece?
I got a dress.
I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too. Wanna see?
That's all right. I'm sure they're quite lovely.
What is it, Miss Vivian?
Edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner. The Rex. Ever been there?
It's a bit beyond my... range, shall we say.
Yeah, mine too. Is it like, y'know, normal?
I think you'll find it normal enough.
Will I like it?
You'll like it fine.
In fifteen minutes I can teach you everything you need to know to dine with the Queen. First, as you pick up the knife you shift your fork to the left hand.
But I always eat like this.
Either you're European or badly brought up.
Hmmm... I vonder vich.
Actually, some of the richest people I know have the worst manners. Of course, Mr. Harris, being of old money, knows his way around a table. All right now, pay attention please. Salad fork.
What if they serve soup?
They will serve salad.
But what if they serve soup?
Then you use your <u>soup spoon</u>.
I like steak.
Then you would use your--
Miss Vivian --
Maybe I'll just order a burger, Barney, that way I can eat with my hands.
Miss Vivian... there's a salon here in the hotel. Instead of worrying unnecessarily about table manners, why don't you just have your hair done instead?
Barnard Thomas here. Miss Vivian, I wonder if you might come down to the front desk. There's someone here to see you.
Me?
Hi, Barney!
Miss Vivian.
Look I just wanted to say goodbye.
Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.
Yeah, well, I check out today.
You're not accompanying him to New York?
Come on, Barney, you and me live in the real world. You don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, Mr. Thomas.
May I help you?
Are you looking for something in particular?
Yes. Something... conservative.
You have beautiful things. How much is this?
I don't think it would fit you.
I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was.
What is with you?
Excuse me?
I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
Would you like to try it on?
Yes?
Do you remember me?
No, I'm sorry, I don't.
Having a good time, Vivian?
Yeah. Thanks.
What?
Yeah. Sure. Why not. Call me at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
Do you want to know what he did? Do you want to know what the crazy son of a bitch did? He handed the whole thing back to Kross! On a silver platter. For no reason! What was he thinking, I mean, what was going through his goddam head? Why? What was all that benevolent crap? What are we going to become, a philanthropic
I bet. A lousy whore and you're the gum in a hundred million dollar deal.
Get out!
Don't even think -- -- don't even think about trying to escape. The chains are far too thick. And don't dream of being rescued either. The only way in is secret. And only the Prince, the Count, and I know how to get in and out.
Then I'm here till I die?
Till they kill you. Yeah.
Then why bother curing me?
The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.
You don't believe me?
If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man?
May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.
He is a sailor on the pirate ship "Revenge." Promise to return him to his ship.
My Westley will always come for me.
He will come for me.
Ah! My dulcet darling. Tonight we marry. Tomorrow morning, your men will escort us to Florin Channel where every ship in my armada waits to accompany us on our honeymoon.
Every ship but the four you sent.
You never sent the ships. Don't bother lying. It doesn't matter. Westley will come for me anyway.
You're a silly girl.
Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear.
I-would-not-say-such things-if- Iwere-you-
You don't seem excited, my little muffin.
Should I be?
Brides often are, I'm told.
I killed him myself.
Who are you?
To think -- all that time it was your cup that was poisoned.
Catch your breath.
If you'll release me ... whatever you ask for ransom ... you'll get it, I promise you...
And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness.
I was giving you a chance. No matter where you take me ... there's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck. He could track a falcon on a cloudy day. He can find you
I never said he was my dearest love. And yes, he will save me. That I know.
You admit to me you do not love your fiance?
He knows I do not love him.
"Are not capable of love" is what you mean.
Rest, Highness.
You're the Dread Pirate Roberts; admit it.
With pride. What can I do for you?
You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
On the high seas, your ship attacked, and the Dread Pirate Roberts never takes prisoners.
I can't afford to make exceptions. Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time.
You mock my pain!
Does it bother you to hear?
Nothing you can say will upset me.
I asked him what was so important for him. "True love," he replied. And then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness. I can only assume he meant you. You should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are.
And what am I?
Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?
... as ... you ... wish...
Farm boy. Polish my horse's saddle. I want to see my face shining in it by morning.
Farm Boy. Fill these with water -- --please.
I fear I'll never see you again.
Of course you will.
But what if something happens to you?
Hear this now: I will come for you.
But how can you be sure?
Can you move at all?
Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly.
I told you, "I would always come for you." Why didn't you wait for me?
Well ... you were dead.
Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
I will never doubt again.
We'll never survive.
Singed a bit, were you?
This will all soon be but a happy memory because Roberts' ship "Revenge" is anchored at the far end. And I, as you know, am Roberts.
But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?
Finally, Roberts decided something. He said, "All right, Westley, I've never had a valet. You can try it for tonight. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." Three years he said that. "Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." It was a fine time for me. I was learning to fence, to fight, anything anyone
We'll never succeed -- we may as well die here.
I mean, what are the three terrors of the Fire Swamp? One, the flame spurts. No problem. There's a popping sound preceding each, we can avoid that. Two, the Lightning Sand. But you were clever enough to discover what that looks like, so in the future we can avoid that too.
Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?
We did it.
Oh, Westley, darling. Westley, why won't you hold me?
Gently.
At a time like this that's all you can think to say? "Gently?"
Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?
What hideous sin have you committed lately?
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
It never happened.
What?
But it did. I was there. This old man said, "Man and wife."
Did you say, "I do"?
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
I did that on purpose. I don't have to miss.
I believe you -- So what happens now?
We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.
You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people?
Frankly, I think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting.
Look are you just fiddling around with me or what?
You're quick.
And a good thing too.
Why is that, do you think?
Why should that make such a difference?
It's fabric from the uniform of an Army officer of Guilder.
Who's Guilder?
Once the horse reaches the castle, the fabric will make the Prince suspect the Guilderians have abducted his love. When he finds her body dead on the Guilder frontier, his suspicions will be totally confirmed.
I've hired you to help me start a war. That's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition.
I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.
No more rhymes now, I mean it.
I only dog paddle.
Faster!
I thought I was going faster.
You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains.
Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself.
-- I do not accept excuses. I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all.
You be careful. -- people in masks cannot be trusted.
Give her to me. Catch up with us quickly.
What do I do?
Finish him, finish him. Your way.
Probably he means no harm.
He's really very short on charm.
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
FEZZIK, are there rocks ahead?
Hello.
It's you.
You don't look so good. You don't smell so good either.
Perhaps not. I feel fine.
He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.
How many could you handle?
I don't think more than ten.
No -- not Vizzini -- I need the Man in Black --
-- what? --
-- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go --
-- where?
To find the Man in Black, obviously.
But you don't know where he is.
The Man in Black?
-- Fezzik, please --
Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily. Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body.
The body?
Have you any money?
I have a little.
Inigo -- there's more than thirty --
What's the difference? We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him.
Has it been fifteen minutes?
Tilt his head back. Open his mouth.
You've been mostly dead all day.
Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?
Will this do?
Where did you get that?
Don't pester him, he's had a hard day.
Inigo.
What?
He's getting away from me, Fezzik. Please. FEZZIK!
I brought you a special present.
What is it?
A book?
That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you.
It doesn't sound too bad. I'll try and stay awake.
Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. His name was Westley, but she never called him that. Isn't that a wonderful beginning?
Yeah. It's really good.
-hold it, hold it-
What is this? Are you trying to trick me? -- Where's the sports? -- Is this a kissing book?
-- wait, just wait --
-- well, when does it get good?
It was a very emotional time for Buttercup --
Westley didn't reach his destination. His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left captives alive. When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered --
What?
The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.
Well, maybe I was a little bit concerned. But that's not the same thing.
Because I can stop now if you want.
Oh no. No, please.
They're kissing again, do we have to hear the kissing part?
Someday, you may not mind so much.
Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good.
You read that wrong. She doesn't marry Humperdinck, she marries Westley. I'm just sure of it. After all that Westley did for her, if she does not marry him, it wouldn't be fair.
Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.
I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!
Do you want me to go on with this?
Yes.
It was ten days till the wedding. The King still lived, but Buttercup's nightmares were growing steadily worse.
See? Didn't I tell you she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck?
Westley's only faking, right?
You want me to read this or not?
Who gets Humperdinck?
I don't understand.
Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At the end, somebody's got to do it. Is it Inigo? Who?
No! I'm okay. I'm okay. -- sit down. All right?
What? What?
No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it.
Now I think you ought to go to sleep.
Okay.
Maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.
Yellin.
Sire.
As Chief Enforcer of all Florin, I trust you with this secret: killers from Guilder are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night.
She will not be murdered. On the day of the wedding, I want the Thieves' Forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested.
Many of the thieves will resist. My regular enforcers will be inadequate.
Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.
It won't be easy, Sire.
Rise and report.
The Thieves' Forest is emptied. Thirty men guard the castle gate.
Double it. My Princess must be safe.
You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.
I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.
Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.
I tell you once again -- surrender!
For the last time -- SURRENDER!
A technicality that will shortly be remedied. But first things first. To the death.
No. To the pain.
I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase.
I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon.
-- and then my tongue, I suppose. I killed you too quickly the last time, a mistake I don't mean to duplicate tonight.
I wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right --
-- and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with it
There was a mighty duel -- it ranged all over. They were both masters.
Who won? How did it end?
The loser ran off alone. The winner followed those footprints toward Guilder!
Shall we track them both?
Could this be a trap?
Once we're out of sight, take him back to Florin and throw him in the Pit of Despair.
She's been like that ever since the Fire Swamp. It's my father's failing health that's upsetting her.
I could never cause you grief; consider our wedding off. You returned this Westley to his ship?
Yes.
Your Princess is really a winning creature. A trifle simple, perhaps, but her appeal is undeniable.
Now, where is that secret knot? It's impossible to find. Are you coming down into the Pit? Westley's got his strength back. I am starting him on The Machine tonight.
Your guess is as good as mine --
Who are you? -- Are we enemies? Why am I on this wall? -- Where's Buttercup? --
Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen.
And it is guarded by sixty men.
And our assets?
Well, why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place? What I wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak.
Why? You can't even lift one.
True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it? Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside.
Now?
Now?
Where's Fezzik?
I thought he was with you.
No.
You know, it's very strange -- I have been in the revenge business so long, now that it's over, I don't know what to do with the rest of my life.
Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
No --
-- yes --
-- all that I have and more please --
-- offer me everything I ask for --
-- anything you want --
What? What?
Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?
Look, I'm retired. And besides, why would you want someone the King's stinking son fired? I might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle.
He's already dead.
Sir. Sir.
Hah?
We're really in a terrible rush.
Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money?
Sixty-five.
This is noble, sir. His wife is crippled. His children are on the brink of starvation.
Are you a rotten liar.
I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years.
He's dead. He can't talk.
Now, mostly dead is slightly alive. Now, all dead...well, with all dead, there's usually only one thing that you can do.
True love. You heard him. You could not ask for a more noble cause than that.
Humiliations galore!
Thank you for everything.
Slow going?
Look, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks. So I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.
Sorry.
I do not suppose you could speed things up?
I could do that. In fact, I've got some rope up here. But I do not think that you will accept my help, since I am only waiting around to kill you.
But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.
That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
You don't know any way you'll trust me?
We'll wait until you're ready.
Do you always begin conversations this way?
How old were you?
I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
You've done nothing but study swordplay?
More pursuit than study lately. You see, I cannot find him. It's been twenty years now. I am starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge.
Well, I certainly hope you find him, someday.
You are ready, then?
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you.
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.
I thought it fitting, considering the rocky terrain --
You are wonderful!
I admit it -- you are better than I am.
Because I know something you don't know.
And what is that?
You're amazing!
There's something I ought to tell you.
Tell me.
Who are you?!
No one of consequence.
I must know.
Get used to disappointment.
Kill me quickly.
Making sure nobody's following us.
Stop doing that. We can all relax, it's almost over-
You're sure nobody's following us?
As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done. And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask?
No reason. It's only, I just happened to look behind us, and something is there.
Go in, get after her!
Look! He's right on top of us. I wonder if he is using the same wind we are using.
He's climbing the rope. And he's gaining on us.
He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!
I want to duel him left-handed.
You know what a hurry we're in.
Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.
Let me explain-
Perhaps an arrangement can be reached.
But if there can be no arrangement, then we are at an impasse.
I'm afraid so -- I can't compete with you physically. And you're no match for my brains.
You're that smart?
Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates?
Yes.
Morons.
Really? In that case, I challenge you to a battle of wits.
I accept.
Inhale this, but do not touch.
I smell nothing.
What you do not smell is called iocane powder. It is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man.
Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I'm not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But you must have known I was not a great fool; you would have counted on it, so I
You've made your decision then7
Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.
Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.
Wait till I get going! Where was I?
Australia.
You're just stalling now.
You're trying to trick me into giving away something -- it won't work --
It has worked -- you've given everything away -- I know where the poison is.
Then make your choice.
What's so funny?
You guessed wrong.
-- get back, witch --
I'm not a witch, I'm your wife. But after what you just said, I'm not even sure I want to be that anymore.
"True love." He said, "true love," Max. My God --
Don't say another word, Valerie.
He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.
Why'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name --
What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck. Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck
I'm not listening.
A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help --
Nobody's hearing nothing!
The chocolate coating makes it go down easier. But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what?
An hour.
Yeah, an hour.
Bye-bye, boys.
Have fun storming the castle.
Think it'll work?
It would take a miracle. Bye!
You feeling any better?
A little bit.
Guess what.
What?
Your grandfather's here.
Mom, can't you tell him that I'm sick?
You are sick, that's why he's here.
He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
How would you like to go back to teasing hair, big mouth?
Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?
Please, please, that's what we're here for. Be careful, that hurt.
I think this would be a marvelous opportunity for you, Roger. Up to now, you've always been associated with musicals, and...
Yes. Dopey show-girls in gooey gowns. Two-three-kick-turn! Turn- turn-kick-turn! It's enough to make you throw up! At last a chance to do straight drama! To deal with conflict, with inner truth. Roger De Bris presents history. Of course, I think we should add a little music. That whole third act has got to go. They're losing the war. It's too depressing. We'll have to
Wait a minute. This is a very big decision. It might effect the course of my entire life. I'll have to think about it. I'll do it.
Congratulations.
Wait! This is Boomerang. This is Boomerang.
What are you saying?
"By the light, by the light,
"Of the silvery moon,
"Of the silvery mooooon,

Enough. It's better. Please, Lambchop, it's better. Stop. You're hurting it again.
How do you do. I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...
You mean ooops, don't you? Say ooops and get out.
I'll wait in the hall ...
Oooooooops!
Uh ... uh ... ooooooops?
Who are you? What do you want? Why are you loitering in my hallway? Speak, dummy, speak! Why don't you speak?
All right. Get a hold of yourself. Take a deep breath, let it out slowly and tell me who you are.
Yes sir.
But sir, I'm not condem ...
You have exactly ten seconds to change that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect. One ... Two ...
Do the books! Do the books!
Yes, sir. Thank you.
Look at that. A white Rolls Royce. That's it baby, when you got it, flaunt it.
I assume you are making those cartoon noises to attract my attention. Am I correct in my assumption, you fish-faced enemy of the people?
I have hurt your feelings.
Good, what is it?
Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?
Go! You have fifty-eight seconds.
Well, sir, it seems ...
You have forty-eight seconds left. Hurry. Hurry.
In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...
What is that? A handkerchief?
Here, don't panic.
I'm sorry ... I don't like people touching my blue blanket. It's not important. It's a minor compulsion. I can deal with it if I want to. It's just that I've had it ever since I was a baby and ... and ... I find it very comforting.
They come here. They all come here. How do they find me?
Mr. Bialystock ...
This is hardly a time for levity. I've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.
Where? What?
According to the backer's list you raised $60,000. But the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand. There's two thousand dollars unaccounted for.
I went to a Turkish bath, who cares? The show was a flop. What difference does it make?
It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud. If they found out, you could go to prison.
Why should they find out? It's only two thousand dollars, Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around. You can do it. You're an accountant. The word 'count' is part of your title.
But that's cheating!
Help!
All right. I'll do it. I'll do it.
Thank you, Bloom. I knew I could con you.
Oh, it's all right ... wha?
Nothing. Nothing. Do it. Do it.
Now let's see, two thousand dollars. That isn't much. I'm sure I can hide it somewhere. After all, the department of internal revenue isn't interested in a show that flopped.
Yes. Right. Good thinking. You figure it out. I'm tired. I'm gonna take a little nap. Wake me if there's a fire.
Yes, what?
What you were saying. Keep talking.
What was I saying?
You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.
Yes, it's quite possible.
Assume away!
Well, it's very easy. You simply raise more money than you really need.
What do you mean?
You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.
What did I do?
You raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play.
So what? What did it get me? I'm wearing a cardboard belt.
Ahhhhhh! But that's where you made your error. You didn't go all the way. You see, if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million.
But the play only cost $60,000 to produce.
Exactly. And how long did it run?
See? You could have raised a million dollars, put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest.
But what if the play was a hit?
Oh, you'd go to jail. If the play were a hit, you'd have to pay off the backers, and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around, get it?
Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!! So, in order for the scheme to work, we'd have to find a sure fire flop.
What scheme?
What scheme? Your scheme, you bloody little genius.
Oh, no. No. No. I meant no scheme. I merely posed a little, academic accounting theory. It's just a thought.
Mr. Bialystock. No. Wait. Please. You're holding me too tight. I'm an honest man. You don't understand.
No, Bloom, you don't understand. This is fate, this is destiny. There's no avoiding it.
Oh, I fell on my keys. I've got to get out of here.
You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar. Don't you ever want to become a butterfly? Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?
You're going to jump on me.
You're going to jump on me. I know you're going to jump on me -- like Nero jumped on Poppea.
What???
Poppea. She was his wife. And she was unfaithful to him. So he got mad and he jumped on her. Up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug. Please don't jump on me.
I'm not going to jump on you!
Will you get a hold on yourself.
Don't touch me! Don't touch me!
What are you afraid of? I'm not going to hurt you! What's the matter with you?
What can I do? What can I do? You're getting me hysterical.
Okay. I'm way over here. Is that better?
It's a little better, but you still look angry.
Good. Good. That's nice. That's very nice. I think I'm coming out of it now. Yes. Yes. I'm definitely coming out of it. Thank you for smiling. It helped a great deal.
Well, you know what they say, "Smile and the world smiles with you." Heh, heh. The man should be in a straight jacket. Feeling better?
Much, thank you. But I am a little lightheaded. Maybe I should eat something. Hysterics have a way of severely depleting one's blood sugar, you know.
They certainly do. They certainly do. Come, let me take you to lunch.
I got it, Mr. Bialystock.
Thank you, Leo. And call me Max. You know, I don't let everybody call me Max. It's only people I really like.
Okay ... Max! And you can call me Leo.
I already have. Come on.
Where would you like to eat?
Well, Max, I don't know, Max. What do you think, Max?
Let me see ... it's such a beautiful day. Why waste it indoors. I've got it! Let's go to Coney Island! We'll lunch at the sea shore.
Coney Island??
What's the matter, Leo? Don't you like Coney Island?
I ... I love it. I haven't been there since I was a kid. But it's nearly two o'clock. I really should be getting back to Whitehall and Marks.
Nonsense! As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned, you're working with Bialystock, right?
Right.
What kind now, Leo?
I don't know. Let's see. We've had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green.
Everybody's a big shot. Well, Leo, are you having a good time?
I don't know. I think so. I feel very strange.
Maybe you're happy.
You think you're not in prison now? Living in a grey little room. Going to a grey little job. Leading a grey little life.
You bet your boots, Leo. It's Bialystock and Bloom -- on the rise. Upward and onward. Say, you'll join me. Nothing can stop us.
I'll do it! By God, I'll do it!
You can't feel it when it's in your hand, when it's in your pocket.
Max, what is it? What are you doing? What's happening?
I'll tell you what's happening. We've struck gold. Not fool's gold, but real gold. The mother lode. The mother lode. The mother of them all.
You found a flop!
It won't run a week!
Run a week? Are you kidding? This play has got to close in the first act.
Max, I don't want to take any Siegfried Oath. I don't know what it is, but I don't want to take it. We might end up in the German Army.
There it is... in red and white! "Springtime For Hitler," signed, sealed and delivered. What's the matter with you?
Look, I'm just not wearing this arm band. I don't care how big the deal is.
Mrs. Eleanor Biddlecombe. She also owns 50% of the profits.
Mrs. Virginia Resnick. She also owns 50% of the profits.
Mrs. Alma Wentworth. She owns 100% of the profits.
Leo, what if this play is a hit?
Then the Department of Justice owns 100% of Bialystock and Bloom.
What are you doing?
How do you do. Have you gone mad? A receptionist that can't speak English. What will people say?
They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh, ooh."
What is she gonna do here?
Max, as I was saying, maybe we should go easy on the spending. I mean these offices and everything.
Why? Take it when you can get it! Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!
But if something should... God forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back. It would look better in court.
Stop talking like that, you white mouse! Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.
Roger De Bris. Roger De Bris. Oh yes, the director. Is he good... I mean bad?
Roger De Bris is the worst director that ever lived.
Do you think he'll take the job?
Well, it's... uh... it's nice and long... I mean, it's... uh... uh... where do you keep your wallet?
So much for Nutsy Fagin.
Here comes the Times Drama Critic.
To failure!
Maybe it's not true!
No way out. No way out.
Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's not true.
No way out. No way out. What? Who?
Why don't we go over to the theatre and see what's really happening? After all, we've only heard from a small portion of the audience. Let's hear what the majority thinks.
What are you doing with those books? Where are you going?
I never should have listened to you.
Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you.
Here. Buy bullets. Kill. Kill them all!
What???
They are? Have you ever eaten with one? Liebkind, go! Kill!
Liebkind, no!
Max, I...
Well, I... Well, it's just that... I'm sorry I called you fat, fat, fat.
Don't help me.
I vas never a member of the Nazi party. I am not responsible. I only followed orders. Who are you?
Mr. Liebkind, wait. You don't understand.
Vhy do you persecute me? My papers are in order. I love my country. "Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, For amber vaves of grain."
Mr. Liebkind, wait ...
"I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy ...
Mr. Liebkind, relax, relax, we're not from the government. We came here to talk to you about your play.
My play? You mean, "Springtime For ... " you know who?
Yes.
Vat about it?
We loved it. We thought it was a masterpiece. That's why we're here. We want to produce it on Broadway.
I vas vit him a great deal, you know.
Vit the Fuhrer, of course. He liked me. Out of all the household staff at Berchtesgarten, I vas his favorite. I vas the only one allowed into his chambers at bedtime.
No kidding?
Oh, sure. I used to take him his hot milk and his opium. Achhh, those were the days. Vat good times ve had. Dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing. You know, not many people knew about it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.
Really, I never dreamed ...
That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies. But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they? Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie! Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi. He would say Narzis, Narzis. Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis. But let me tell this, and you're
Wait. No. How do I know I can trust you? How do I know you vill present this play in the manner and spirit in vhich it vas conceived?
We swear it!
Not good enough... Vould you be villing to take the Siegfried oath?
Yes. We would!
You think out of all those Hitlers you could find just one...
Vaaaat???
Franz, don't you see, Hitler was a man of his time. This is a man of his time.
But he has long hair!
Don't look at the outside, look at the inside. It's the inner Hitler we're after. The young beautiful Hitler, who danced his way to glory.
Franz, trust me. I promise I won't let you down.
Not.
Five o'clock. Killed a whole day playing hide-and-seek with a crazy Kraut.
Vhere? Vhere?... oh...
You crazy lunatic! What are you shooting at us for? Why don't you use this where it will do us some good? Why don't you shoot the actors? Liebkind, have I ever steered you wrong?
Always.
Never mind. Listen. Every night people are laughing at your beloved Fuhrer. Why?
Now ve take the two fuse leads, attach them to the terminals of the conductor and ve're in business.
Plus to minus. Negative to positive. Male to...
Come on. Let's get going.
Here. You see. This is the slow fuse. It is much wider. It has more resistance, more density. Therefore, it burns slower.
You mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on?
Vhy do you always call me kraut? Kraut is cabbage! Do ve call you hot dogs? Ve call you Yanks not franks!
Do it! Do it!
Do you need us?
Yes. She's an adult, educational toy made in Sweden for children over fifty.
Stop looking at me like that. She's not an indulgence. She happens to be our new receptionist. She goes with our new surroundings.
Ulla, I'd like you to meet my partner and associate, Mr. Leo Bloom.
Bialystock and Blum. Bialystock and Blum. Bialystock and Blum. Got dag pa dig. Bialystock and Blum.
Min Bialystock.
Come on. We'd better hurry. We're late.
Call chauffeur. Get car.
Good. Good. We go Motel.
You, Blum go Motel.
No. No Motel. Get car. Get car.
Get car. Get car.
We make love?
Don't forget the checkee. Can't produce playees without checkees.
Finder's keepers.
Feeling better?
Good. Let's fool around. Now, I'll be the innocent little milk maid and you'll be the naughty stable boy. Oh, this milk is so heavy. I'll never reach the house. Help. Will someone help me?
Wait. Wait. We can't play today. I have too many appointments.
We can't play today?
Thursday. Thursday. We'll play Thursday. We'll play the Contessa and the chauffeur.
Oh, the best one.
Until Thursday, then, Contessa Mio.
Oh, Bialy, please, just a little. Just a little.
So, the Count hired you this morning, Rudolfo ... Watch the road ... Watch the road.
I can't take my eyes off you. How can I drive when you drive me mad. Mad.
Rudolfo, you dirty pig! Pull over.
Until Thursday, then, you bawdy wench.
Oooh. I love it. Hold me, touch me.
Thursday. I'll see you Thursday.
Good. Yes. Thursday.
Like clockwork.
I shall count the minutes.
Of course, the check, I had it with me all the time.
I don't know what's happening to me. I must be getting old.
Is it all right? I made it out to cash. You didn't tell me the name of the play.
Oh, it's fine. Fine. Good. Good. Bye. Bye.
Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes.
Ta. Ta.

No, not at all sir, we're quite serious. We want to produce your play. I have the contracts right here.
Oh joy of joys! Oh, dream of dreams! I can't believe it. Birds, birds, do you hear? Otto, Bertz, Heintz, Hans, Wolfgang, do you hear? Ve are going to clear the Fuhrer's name. Fly, fly, spread the words.

Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.
Vat?
People can hear you.
Yes. The actors. I must destroy the actors.
Okay.
Where are you going vit the light?
I need it. How'm I gonna find the fuse?
Lorenzo Saint DuBois. But everybody calls me LSD.
What have you done, LSD?
Six months, I'm out on probation, but it's cool now, baby.
I mean in show business.
Oh, in show business. Well, let's put it this way, my next job will be my debut.
What do you do best?
Hey, man, I can't do that here, that's what they put me away for.
Oh, sing. Sing!
Hey, baby, that's where they put me, Sing-Sing. How'd you know that, you been up?
We are falling back on all fronts. Our soldiers are retreating.
No good, baby, no good. You heard my orders. Nobody retreats. Attack! Attack!
Who can we attack? They're all too big.
Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland!
Where's Goebbels? Where's my little Joe?
He's the only cat left that still grooves me.
Heil, baby! I just finished the morning propaganda broadcasts.
What did you tell the people?
I told them we invaded England.
Hey, baby, that's good! How'd we come out?
We won.
I always forget to put the sign on, but we do have vacancy. Twelve in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.
In the past two days I've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.
I don't really forget the sign, it just doesn't seem... any use. This used to be the main highway. Want to register, please?
Sit down. I don't want to trouble you, just want to ask...
You out to buy a motel?
No.
Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days... What was it you wanted to ask?
I'm looking for a missing person. My name's Arbogast, private investigator... Trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week. From Phoenix. It's a private matter... family wants to forgive her... She isn't in trouble.
I didn't think the police went searching for people who weren't in trouble.
I'm not the police.
We have reason to believe she came this way... might have stopped in this area... Did she stop here?
No. No one has stopped here in weeks...
Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?
Committing myself to what? You sure talk like a Policeman.
No. At least I don't recall.
She might have used an alias. Mary Crane's the real name, but she might've registered...
Now there's a couple even remarking about your sign, and see how easily you forgot them?
What?
Don't know where she got "Marie," but "Samuels" figures. Her boy friend's name is Sam. Was she in disguise? Or do you want to check the picture again?
It was raining and her hair didn't look like that... damped out, I guess.
Tell me all about her.
She arrived kind of late, wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early.
How early?
Very early. Dawn.
Of which morning?
The following morning. Sunday.
No one met her?
No.
Or arrived with her.
No.
She didn't call anyone? Even locally?
No.
You didn't spend the whole night with her did you?
No! Of all...
How do you know she didn't make a call?
She was tired. She said she had a long drive ahead of her, in the morning... Yes, now I'm remembering very clearly because I'm picturing. When you make a picture of the moment in your mind, you can remember every detail. She was sitting back there, no she was standing up, with some sandwich still in her hand, and she said she had to
Back where?
What do you mean?
You said she was sitting "back there," or standing rather...
Oh. My private parlor. She had an awful hunger... so I made her some supper. And then she went to bed and left in the morning. I didn't even see her leave.
How did she pay you?
What?
Cash or check? For the cabin...
Cash.
And when she left, she never came back.
Why should she? I'm sorry, I have work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...
I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't aspic! This ain't jelling.
I don't know what you expect me to know about... people come and go...
She isn't still here, is she?
Not at all!
Suppose I wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would I need a warrant?
I guess I've got one of those faces you can't help believing.
Anyone at home?
I live there. Alone.
Someone is sitting in that window.
She's... ill. Confined to her room. It's practically living alone.
If this girl Mary Crane were here, you'd have no reason to hide her would you?
Of course not.
If she paid you well?
Now, look...!
Or if she had you say... gallantly protecting her... you wouldn't be fooled... you'd know she was just using you. Wouldn't you?
I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable of being fooled! Not even by women!
I didn't mean that as a slur on your manhood. I'm sorry.
That's all right. maybe she could have fooled me. But... She didn't fool my mother.
Your mother met her? Can I talk to your mother?
No. I told you, she's confined...
Just for a moment. She might have picked up a hint you'd miss.
Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I won't disturb...
No! Just no! I have one of those breaking points like any other man, believe it or not, and I'm near it. There's just so much pushing I can take and I think...
Let's all talk about Mary.
Who are you, friend?
What's your interest?
Somebody better tell me what's going on and tell me fast! I can take so much and then...
Why?
Must've needed it.
Did you check in Phoenix... hospitals... maybe she had an accident... a hold-up...
She was seen leaving town in her car. Seen by her very victims, I might add.
I don't know.
Someone has seen her. Someone always sees a girl with forty thousand dollars. She is your girl friend, isn't she?
Sam, they don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back. It was all in cash...
Casharoonie!
You came up here on a hunch, Miss Crane? Nothing more? No phone call... from him, or from your sister herself?
Not even a hunch. Just hope.
With a little checking, I could get to believe you.
I'm in no mood for trouble!
What?
There's an old saying, "First customer of the day is always the most trouble!" But like I said, I'm in no mood for it so I'm just going to treat you so fair and square you won't have one human reason to give me...
Can I trade in my car and take another?
You can do anything you've a mind to... and bein' a woman, you will! That yours?
Yes, it's... nothing wrong with it, I'm just...
Sick of the sight of it! Well, suppose you look around for something that strikes your eyes and meanwhile I'll have my mechanic give yours the once over and... want some coffee? I was just about...
That's the one I'd've picked for you myself!
How much?
Go ahead! Spin it around the block. Now I know you don't know anything about engine condition, but you can feel, can't you... and it's all in the feel, believe me, you feel that one around the block...
It looks fine. How much will it be, with my car...?
You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over? You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin' you?
Of course not. Please.
Well... heck, this is the first time I ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman! I'd figure roughly... ...your car plus five hundred.
Five hundred.
Aha! Always got time to argue money, huh...?
I take it... you can prove that car's yours... I mean, out of state and all... got your pink slip and your...
I think I have the necessary papers. Is there a Ladies Room...
I think you'd better give it a trial spin. Don't want any bad word of mouth about California Charlie.
I'd really rather not. Please. Can't we just settle this and...
I'll be perfectly honest with you, Ma'am. It's not that I don't trust you, but...
But what? Is there anything so terribly wrong about... making a decision and wanting to hurry? Do you think I've stolen... my car?
No, M'am. I was only about to say, I've sent my mechanic out to give your car a little test... that's all.
I'd like to be ready when he gets back.
Isn't Mr. Lowery back from lunch?
He's lunching with the man who's buying the Harris Street property, you know, that oil lease man... so that's why he's late. You getting a headache?
It'll pass. Headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting.
Were there any calls?
Aren't you going to take the pills? They'll knock that headache out.
Yes, Mr. Lowery.
Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?
No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.
Call her sister! If no one's answering at the house....
I called her sister, Mr. Lowery, where she works, the Music Makers Music Store, you know? And she doesn't know where Mary is any more than we do.
You better run out to the house. She may be... unable to answer the phone...
Will you help us? I think something's wrong out there!
Now. Your sister is missing how long?
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
Yes.
She stole some money.
A lot?
Forty thousand dollars.
Mary had been there, one night, and had left.
With the forty thousand dollars?
He didn't mention the money. What he said on the phone isn't important, is it? He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!
Like what?
Go out there! Find somebody, ask some questions! I'm sorry if I seem over-anxious to you. I keep thinking... something's wrong. I have to know what!
I think something's wrong, too, Miss. But not the same thing. I think your private detective is what's wrong. I think he got himself a hot lead as to where your sister was going... probably from Norman Bates... and called you to keep you still while he took off after her and the money.
Please!
You should've called in the police the second you found your sister has skipped. You go starting private investigations, using people you don't even know...
What difference does that...
Yes.
Did he say anything about my sister?
I still feel...
Can see you do. Sorry I couldn't make you feel better. You want to come to my office this afternoon and report a missing person... And the theft, is what you want to do! Sooner you drop this thing in the lap of the law, that's the sooner you'll stand a chance of your sister bein' picked up. How about that?
Yes?
May I talk to you?
I'm Mary's sister.
Lila.
Is something wrong?
I want to know if my sister is here.
Here?
With you.
Where?
I don't know where. In your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere.
What's the matter?
What should I know?
To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?
No. I take it you don't either? How long?
Last Friday. She left work, and home... I was in Tucson over the weekend... I haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.
And you thought she'd come up here, to me? If she had, what reason would she have for not calling you?
A good reason, I suppose.
Well what do you think, we eloped or something? Or we're living in sin and...
Mr. Loomis, you're so busy being defensive that you haven't even reacted to the most serious fact of all. Mary is missing.
I was getting to that!
What do you know about it?
Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive.
What thing?
Huh?
What thing could we be in together?
I hate tears.
Is Mary... in trouble?
Yes.
Well why didn't she come to me... call me...?
Not that kind... You men and your egos.
Yes... I just... did. The moment they told me...
I just listened... and believed everything they told me. 'She stole the money.' 'We don't want to get her in trouble.' 'No don't bring the police in'...
It was her boss' idea not to report it to the police?
No. The man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and I... I should've called the police.
He must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... All that cash...
I ought to call the police right now!
No.
Why not? Sam, is she hiding here? Are you two planning to go away with the money?
How could I go away? I'm in debt up to my... If she did steal that money... It's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would. Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us...
She haven't even called you?
I didn't see her... and I didn't hear from her! Believe that!
I need to... I need to believe something. This is the first time I've ever come up against anything I couldn't... understand.
You've led a charmed life.
No. I just think... anything can be explained. But Mary, doing a thing like this... I don't know how to handle...
Maybe we can handle it together.
I came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all I know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. I'd better go home.
I think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don't you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here.
You want me to stay here?
She'll need both of us.
Where... can I stay?
Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely sound. Ever notice, Lila?
Sam. He said an hour. Or less.
It's been three.
Are we just going to go on sitting here?
He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?
You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.
Hundreds! Which one is your pet?
Whenever I start contemplating the panic button, your back straightens up and your eyes get that God-looks- out-for-everybody look and... I feel better.
I feel better when you feel better.
Where's the old highway?
You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours.
Yes.
That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
Patience doesn't run in our family. Sam, I'm going out there!
Arbogast said...
Got the number of the motel out on the old highway? Bates, I think.
Sam! Why call when we can go?
Probably on his way back right now.
Sam, I'm going.
Stay here.
Why can't I go out there with you?
I don't know... One of us has to be here in case Arbogast's on the way.
Just wait here?
He didn't come back here?
Sam.
No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the old lady at home... A sick old lady unable to answer the door... or unwilling.
Where could he have gone?
Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on...
Without calling me?
In a hurry.
Sam, he called me when he had nothing definite, nothing but a dissatisfied feeling. Don't you think he'd have called if he had anything...
Let's go see Al Chambers.
Who's he?
Our Deputy sleeps.
Well?
Nothing. Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.
Does that mean we can't...
No, thank you. It's my problem, too.
I don't know where to start... Except at the beginning.
Yes.
I've only been here five. Right now it feels like ten, but...
Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.
I won't feel satisfied unless I got out there, Sam.
I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.
Of course we will.
Where'd you go to college?
I didn't. I got a job, too. I wonder if that hurt her, my not letting her sacrifice for me? Some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you don't let them.
I wonder so many things about her now. Why she never told me about you... Funny, when you think there's an answer to everything, you think you know all the answers.
We were going to get married. Are going to get married!
Do you know how I found out about you? I found one of your letters... it was a nice letter, Sam.
This is the old highway.
I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper.
Watch your tenses.
Huh?
You going to wait here for me?
I'm going with you. But we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in...
We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside.
You won't believe it... But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers!
I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting?
We should have asked for Cabin One... The one Mary was in.
We have to go into that cabin and search it, Sam... no matter what we're afraid of finding and no matter how much it may hurt.
I know. Do you think if something happened, it happened there?
Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell... what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else? Forty thousand dollars?
How could we prove... Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...
There must be some proof that exists right now! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary... Some way!
What makes you sound so certain?
Sorry.
Hospital clean.
What?
What is it?
That's proof Mary was here! It would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to...
Bates never denied Mary was here.
Yes. But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?
You can't go up there.
Why not?
It's regular. Okay?
Call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the afternoon off. It's Friday anyway... and hot.
What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?
We could laze around here a while longer.
Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time's up... Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this.
I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it...
When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.
You sure talk like a girl who's been married.
Sam!
I'm sorry, Mary. My old Dad used to say 'when you can't change a situation, laugh at it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it.
I've lost my girlish laughter.
The only girlish thing you have lost.
Sam. This is the last time.
For what?
This! Meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive! You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't even come.
Okay. What do we do instead, write each other lurid love letters?
I haven't time to argue. I'm a working girl.
And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy!
It is tragic! Or it will be... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here...
You can't laugh at it, huh?
Can you?
And besides, when you say I make tax- deductible excuses you make me out a criminal.
You couldn't be a criminal if you committed a major crime.
I wish I were. Not an active criminal but... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal. Next best thing to no conscience at all.
I have to go, Sam.
I can come down next week.
No.
Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public?
We can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!
And after the steak... do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama's picture to the wall?
Sam! No!
Mary, whenever it's possible, tax- deductible or not, I want to see deductible you. And under any conditions. Even respectability.
You make respectability sound... disrespectful.
I'm fed up with sweating for people who aren't there. I sweat to pay off my father's debts... and he's in his grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere.
I pay, too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.
A couple of years and the debts will be paid off. And if she ever re- marries, the alimony stops... and then...
I haven't even been married once yet!
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
Sam, let's go get married.
And live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in Fairvale. We'll have a lot of laughs. When I send my ex-wife her money, you can lick the stamps.
You know what I'd like? A clear, empty sky... and a plane, and us in it... and somewhere a private island for sale, where we can run around without our... shoes on. And the wherewithal to buy what I'd like. Mary, you want to cut this off, go out and find yourself someone available.
I'm thinking of it.
How can you even think a thing like that!
Don't miss your plane.
Hey, we can leave together can't we?
Dirty night.
You have a vacancy?
We have twelve vacancies. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies. They moved away the highway.
I thought I'd gotten off the main...
Your home address. Oh, just the town will do.
I want sleep more than anything. Except maybe, food.
There's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside Fairvale.
Am I that close to Fairvale?
Stuffy in here. Well... the mattress is soft and there're hangers in the closet and... stationary with "Bates' Motel" printed on it in case you want to make your friends back home envious... and... the... over there....
The bathroom.
I'll be in the office if you want anything... just tap on the wall.
Thank you, Mr. Bates.
You have something most girls never have.
I have?
There's no name for it... But it's something that, that puts a person at ease.
Thank you. Again.
You're not going to go out again and drive up to that diner, are you?
No.
Then will you do me a favor? Will you have supper here? I was just about to, myself... nothing more than some sandwiches and a lot of milk, but I'd like it if you'd come up to the house and... I don't set a fancy table but... the kitchen's awful homey.
I'd like to.
I've caused you some trouble.
Mother... ...what is the phrase... "she isn't herself today"... I think that's it.
I'm sorry. I wish... people could apologize for other people.
You're very... kind.
You eat like a bird.
You'd know, of course.
It's a strange hobby. Curious, I mean.
Uncommon, too.
I imagine so.
It's not as expensive as you'd think. Cheap, really. Needles, thread, sawdust .. the chemicals are all that cost anything.
A man should have a hobby.
It's more than a hobby... sometimes... a hobby is supposed to pass the time, not fill it.
Is your time so empty?
Oh, no! I run the office, tend the cabins and grounds, do little chores for mother... the ones she allows I might be capable of doing.
You go out... with friends?
Friends? Who needs friends. A boy's best friend is his mother. You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?
Only my share.
Where are you going? I don't mean to pry...
I'm looking for a private island.
What are you running away from?
Why do you ask that?
No. People never run away from anything. The rain didn't last very long. You know what I think? I think we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out. We scratch and claw... but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch.
Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.
I was born in mine. I don't mind it anymore.
You should... mind it.
Oh I do... but I say I don't.
If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again.
Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever! Or at least, defy her. But I couldn't. She's ill.
She sounded strong...
I mean... ill. She had to raise me all by herself after my dad died... I was only five... and it must have been a strain. Oh, she didn't have to go out to work or anything, Dad left us with a little something... anyway, a few years ago... Mother met a man. He talked her into building this motel... We could have talked
Except you.
A son is a poor substitute for a lover.
Why don't you go away?
To a private island, like you?
No, not like me.
It's too late for me. And besides... who'd look after her? She'd be alone up there, the fire would go out... damp and cold, like a grave. When you love someone, you don't do that to them, even if you hate them. Oh, I don't hate her. I hate... what she's become. I hate... the illness.
An Institution? A madhouse? People always call a madhouse "someplace." Put her in Someplace!
I'm sorry... I didn't mean it to sound uncaring...
What do you mean about caring? Have you ever seen one of those places? Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you... and my mother there? Why? has she harmed you? She's as harmless as... one of these stuffed birds.
I am sorry. I only felt... it seemed she was harming you. I meant...
I've suggested it myself. But I hate to even think such a thing. She needs me... and it isn't... ...it isn't as if she were a maniac, a raving thing... it's just that... sometimes she goes a little mad. We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you?
Yes, and just one time can be enough. Thank you.
Thank you, Norman.
Norman.
You're not going to... to your room already?
I'm very tired. And I'll have a long drive tomorrow. All the way back to Phoenix.
Phoenix?
I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out. Before it's too late for me, too.
Why don't you stay a little while, just for talking.
I'd like to, but...
Alright. I'll see you in the morning. I'll bring you breakfast. What time will you...
Very early. Dawn.
Alright, Miss...
Crane.
That's it.
In quite a hurry.
Yes. I didn't mean to sleep so long. I was afraid I'd have an accident last night, from sleepiness... so I decided to pull over...
You slept here all night?
Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes...
There are plenty of motels in this area. You should have... I mean, just to be safe...
I didn't intend to sleep all night! I just pulled over... have I broken any laws?
No, m'am.
Then I'm free to go...?
Is anything wrong?
Of course not! Am I acting as if... something's wrong?
Frankly, yes.
Please... I'd like to go...
Is there?
Is there what? I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...
In the course of my duty, I never "take up" anyone's time, whether it's to give a warning, or a ticket, or help! Believe that, M'am. Now if you woke up on the wrong side of... the car seat, that's one thing. But when you act as if I've just placed you under arrest...
I'm sorry.
Wait a minute!
May I see your license?
Why?
Oh?
Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering you...
We have a problem.
Mary is Lila's sister?
Yes. He traced her to that motel, out on the old highway...
Bates' Motel. He has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it... Go on, Sam.
He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs. Bates...
Norman took a wife?
You mean that old woman I saw sittin' in the window wasn't Norman Bates' mother?
Maybe you saw Mary!
We thought, if you didn't mind, we'd go out to the motel with you.
Why don't you call Norman and let him say just what happened, if he give the man a hot lead and he did just scooted off... it'll make the girl feel better, Albert.
Recluse. Kinder word.
Norman? Sheriff Chambers. Been just fine, thanks. Listen, we got some worries here. Did you have a man stop out there tonight... Well, this one wouldn't be a customer, anyway. A private detective, name of...
Arbogast.
Barefaced.
I helped Norman pick out the dress she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.
It ain't only local history, Sam, it's the only murder-and-suicide case in Fairvale ledgers! Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy she was... involved with, when she found out he was married, then took a helping of the same stuff herself. Strychnine. Ugly way to die.
Went out before service.
Just coming up to ring for you.
I suppose you want a cabin.
I'll take you to...
It isn't necessary.
I'll get your bags.
Haven't any.
Looking for me?
Yes, matter of fact. The wife's taking a nap and... I can never keep quiet enough for her... so I thought I'd look you up and... talk.
Satisfied with your cabin?
I've been doing all the talking so far, haven't I?
Yes.
I always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance. Yet there you are, doing all the listening! You are alone here, aren't you? It would drive me crazy.
That would be a rather extreme reaction, wouldn't it?
I'm not saying you shouldn't be contented here, I'm just doubting that you are. I think if you saw a chance to get out from under... you'd unload this place...
This place! This isn't 'a place.' It's my only world. I grew up in that house back there. I was a happy child. My mother and I... we were more than happy.
My mother is not dead!
You look frightened. Have I been saying something frightening?
I don't know what you've been saying.
I've been talking about your mother... about your motel. How are you going to do it?
Do what?
Buy a new one! In a new town! Where you won't have to hide your mother!
Shut up!
Where will you get the money to do that, Bates... or do you already have it... socked away... a lot of it...
Leave me alone!
...Forty thousand dollars!
I won't have you bringing strange young girls in for supper... ...by candlelight, I suppose, in the cheap erotic fashion of young men with cheap, erotic minds!
Mother, please...
And then what? After supper, music? Whispers?
Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...
Mother, she's just a stranger! As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?
Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
They thought she'd be coming to me.
Yes.
Everyone concerned thought... if they could get her to give back the money... they could avoid involving her with the police.
He was out when I was there. If he's back he probably isn't even in bed yet.
Was that all?
Now wait a minute, Sam. You sure you saw an old woman?
Yes! In the house behind the motel. I pounded and called but she... just ignored me.
You didn't find anything.
No mother.
By gosh, them stiffs are get- tin' heavier and more of 'em every day. They even got the coroner working overtime.
Yeah, between the gangsters and the autos, we won't need another war to carry off the population.
You didn't even mention the suicides. Did you notice the beaut that came in today?
Did I?
That's the one that's got the coroner doing nightwork.
Imagine--she was alive. What a horror. Could have been buried alive. She must have run away from the morgue.
Never mind your theories. Was she ever conscious?
Just before she died she came to--
Did she talk?
Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]
Did you wish to see someone?
You mean he doesn't work for you?
No, not exactly. Why the great anxiety? It must be something important.
It is--you know what a struggle he's had.
He's inherited a fortune.
You say a fortune. He never spoke to me of any rich relatives.
He hardly knew of them him- self. I believe it was his uncle in Australia.
I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.
Don't tell him. I want to be the first to bring him the news.
That's only natural. Maxwell will be here around eight tonight.
Gosh, you had me fooled.
So--friendly or otherwise--?
[Perfectly friendly, my dear.] At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose.
Then you knew of the inheritance?
Sure--I have one little job to accomplish, then we can leave together. No doubt you are surprised at this disguise.
No, I wouldn't be surprised at anything from you. Winningly. MAXWELL Now, honey--you are here in time to help me and you can--
I knew there was a catch in this some place--but spill it. Quiet and dramatic. MAXWELL In the other room, I have a crazy woman that I have been treating.
Ha ha, <U>you</U> have been treating.
Quiet, will you? This is ser- ious. Our lives are in danger.
That's what I said. Now, lis- ten to me. I want you to help me take this woman down stairs. I will give her a shot. You can take care of her till I get help.
No-
Who are you? What is your name?
What made you steal? Are you hungry?
No--I don't want to give any money. Everybody wants money--I'm not going to give any money.
Who wants your money-- maybe I can help you.
No, I don't want money. I only want to find out who you are and where you live. My business is finding peo- ple. Not taking their money.
You--a friend to me?
Why, yes, to you, Mr.--Mr. --what?
No, no! I won't sign any pa- pers. You can't make me--
Tell me, just what you know of Dr. Meirschultz.
Papers--they all want me to sign papers.
Yes--I can't stand it-- everybody wants papers-- oh, oh
Sure--they're sorta queer, I'd say. They's lots of queer goings on up there. They even brought a dog back to life once.
That sounds to me very remarkable.
It may be, but to my notion, those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later.
Maybe you're right.
I know I am. Why, I even heard a shot up there last night.
I understand from your neighbors that all [them] cats are making noise at night. Dr. Meirschultz has put in a complaint.
He's been stealing my cats to experiment on [them]. I know cause I've been [watching] spying on him.
[Lot of] How many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?
Thousands?
What' s the idea [of wanting so many] do you sell them [to the doctor]?
Oh, no. It's my own idea. I'm in the business. In the fur business.
Oh, I see. Cats' fur.
That's it. You get it quick.
But where do the rats come in?
Oh, him. He has a cat of his own. But his assistant--he's the cat-hatenest man I ever saw. Goofy, if ya ast me.]
I'm detective Jones. Just dropped in to tell you a bit of news.
By the way, where <U>is</U> your assistant?
How do you do.
Well, news of Buckley?
Yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?
Why, Buckley stole that body. That's what alarmed Mrs. Buckley so. I have been try- ing to get her to put Buckley in an institution but she wants to keep him.
Yes indeed. He has been a <U>difficult</U> case. Now that <U>you</U> have him in custody--you have him haven't you?
Oh, yes, he's in good hands now.
Fine. Mrs. Buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea.
Do you have many patients, doctor?
Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
What's down there?
Oh, just the basement. Some day I intend to build an experimental laboratory down there. It will save me from intrusion.
You here again?
Yes. Mr. Buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. He's in the hospital. How about it?
What's that?
Take me down there.
It won't do any good. They are a pair of would-be mur- deresses fighting it out.
Man, you're crazy. What kind of a place is this?
Oh, <U>I'm</U> crazy, am I? Let me tell you something. Those women have--the gleam--
Dr. Meirschultz, please.
What are you going to do?
I'm going to call the police.
You can't double-cross me like that. You were to help me. You were to operate on him. You were going to put him under my power.
You are right. But before I can get him back here, you will have to help me.
[Something very important. I have been threatened;] Mrs. Maxwell, my assistant's wife, is crazy. She thinks I mur- dered her husband. [She wants to murder me.] I want you to help me quiet her-- give her a shot from this hypo. [Keep it hid till we get her] down in the basement-- there is a secret vault [there]. We will put her there till
It sounds all right, except for the fact that she's crazy. It seems to me she has the right idea--.
What is it?
The wound is bleeding!
What is it now?
I'm losing my blood!
You're losing your blood?
Yes!
What were you dreaming about?
A voice ...
That spoke to you?
That called ... commanded ...
Your father?
Yes!
Did you hear?
The child!
Yes.
There's no child here.
There's no child here, and no dogs either.
No?
By the time we return there, all the preparations for the blood transfusion are completed.
Joseph returns from the room where Gisèle is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it.
The blood transfusion is now in progress. The only words are curt orders like: 'Now! - Quickly! - That's enough! - Give it to me! - Sit still!' etc.
Joseph is reading the diary, which arouses his interest more and more. It is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him. An extract from the diary is shown.
The blood transfusion continues. Marc has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp, so that he can see Nikolas in bright light, while he himself sits in the dark. Nikolas watches Léone's face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death. Life slowly seems to return to her, and her breathing becomes more peaceful. She opens her eyes and looks at
Another fragment of the diary is shown [having to do with vampires].
You killed him! Come on with the rest of it. You killed him!
No -- I didn't. It was Igor at the waxworks.
But you were in on it -- you worked for him.
No -- the only thing I did for him was to keep track of the man named Worth that runs the place where you arrested me tonight.
You lie!
Yes, why?
I wondered. Did he invite you to lunch, or did you invite him?
What are you laughing at?
I just had a picture of you telling a landlady some day that you didn't have the rent, but Ralph is awful sweet.
I don't see any big-moneyed boys running after you.
I met one last night ... all the money this side of Peoria.
Did you? Where?
I don't have any affairs. What do you mean?
I don't think you could have a real affair. You couldn't care for anyone.
I've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but I've never hit one with dough. This love-in-an-attic isn't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon.
I don't agree with you.
All right, you raise the kids -- I'll raise the roof. I'd rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers, than expire in a pan of dirty dish water.
You would.
He can look like a chimpanzee and act like an igorot but he must have dough -- plenty of dough.
You think money is the only requisite. It happens that the poor people are happier.
But what about lunch?
There's no hurry. It's early.
I can't convince the inner woman that we can wait. She's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on Santa Claus and the other dummies. I've only had a cup of coffee since last night.
Why didn't you eat last night?
Ouch! Eat? You can do a solo if you don't step on it. I'm going to bow out on you.
What's the rush? There's no first act. They'll all be there and we don't have to appear at any particular time.
I'm hungry. I'll eat the first child I see. And I've an appointment with young Winton at 8:30.
You wouldn't get mixed up with that little rotter, would you?
No? Give me a chance, baby. Money is music in my ears, and when his old man kicks off there'll be a million dollar tune.
If you're going to be indiscreet, I wish you'd be a little more discreet about it. Rich men, like Winton, love you and leave you.
I think so.
Disappoint me? Why, what do you mean, dear?
Why, certainly, sir. My fiancée. Charlotte, may I present Mr. Igor.
But why? She's the best friend I've got.
She isn't anybody's friend, and I don't like you living with her. She's a bad influence.
Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know.
What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.
I won't let you say that!
Well, I do say it.
She thinks it's funny to talk the way she does, but--
Don't kid yourself -- she means it.
Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?
You wouldn't have said that before you met her.
I'd call it stupid at any time.
Well, that's just how stupid I am. When you go riding, it will be with me. And if it's with someone else, you can make it a permanent arrangement.
So that's the way it is?
That's the way I feel about it.
If you will forgive this poor, crippled stump, my dear, I am very happy to know you.
Thank you.
Although you would be amused if I were to tell you that I knew you before you were born. Before this terrible thing happened to me ... ... I made a very beautiful statue. Even if I had not met with this disaster, I could never have hoped to do anything finer, probably nothing quite so fine. And, my child, you are that figure
We'll be coming to the opening.
But I think these things are beautiful.
Oh! Mr. Igor! -- I'm so glad you're here -- I don't know why I should be, but I was a little bit afraid.
Oh! So, my little friend, you have honored me by accepting my invitation of last night.
No -- I -- wanted to speak to Ralph. We had a silly argument last night and I said something unkind.
Oh, you children, you happy children. You've quarreled and now you're going to be friends again. And that is as it should be. Never let any stupid misunderstandings come between you.
But it was really my fault.
And he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. Let him think it was his fault ... He should be along very shortly .. . But be very stern before you forgive him, especially if it is your fault ... While you're waiting for your friend, would you like to see some new figures I have downstairs?
Oh, please, Mr. Igor, I'm terribly ashamed. I shouldn't have put you to so much trouble.
Let me go! Let me go!
We have found immortality, you and I. You must not be afraid.
Please, oh, please, I haven't done anything to hurt you.
What! What are you talking about?
The body of Joan Gale!
Hello, Express. What's the idea, trying to outsmart the police?
I'm not kidding. Joan Gale's body is packed in the box in the basement, and I saw the most horrible thing down there.
Are you giving me this straight?
Listen, copper, get a load of this. While you're chinning yourself on a bar rail, I run down this story ... my story. Consider yourself my assistant.
What do you think I am?
Whatever you are, you're the only one of it.
It happens that I'm the law.
Not a very good one, I guess. He wasn't like anything human. He hobbled and swayed like a monkey, and the face, from the glimpse I got of it in the light from the street, was like an African war mask.
You mean he was colored?
Hey, what do you think you're doing? Put that stuff back!
As I live and breathe and wear spats ... the prince.
Been doing experiments with Scotch and soda again?
Where did you get the news item? From a little bird?
Yeah. Have a pleasant vacation?
Charming. More delightful people crippled.
Great. Consider yourself crippled -- financially. See if you can jar your charming friends loose from enough to eat on.
Meaning what?
I'm through clowning. You're all washed up. Get out!
What do you mean, you poor ham! This is New Year's!
All right, what about it? We get out a paper just the same. Did you ever stop to think of that?
And how does one go about getting these human documents, may I inquire?
That is none of our business. But you bring me something for the next edition if it's only a recipe for spaghetti!
Well, ain't that a shame. Nice little chappie that wouldn't harm a fly ... everybody picking on the little fellow.
If this kid was some unknown soda jerker, they wouldn't have pinched him. But he's George Winton and they're playing him up. It's a Roman holiday for every paper hat editor in New York.
Why the goose pimples? If he wasn't social register -- if it was somebody like me, you'd be trying to hang him.
I wouldn't be trying, beloved. I would hang him! And another thing, all this gaga about the body disappearing. Eight bodies have been stolen in New York within the last eighteen months. Doesn't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle?
And ruin a perfectly good story? Don't be silly.
No, I mean it. I think this kid's entitled to a break.
He's getting a break, ain't he? He's front page.
You give me a pain!
I'm glad to hear it. When did you go in for crusading in the cause of justice? This lousy mug, with all the money in the world, has had two or three nasty affairs. He's kept out o' print because his great- grandfather was smarter than the Indians.
Well, anyway, he couldn't have copped that body -- he was in jail.
You don't think he'd be sap enough to do the job himself. I hope they give him the works. Even if he didn't kill the kid, he's responsible for her death, and they can fry him any time without making me sore.
Well, I won't work on it from that angle.
Oh, you won't -- you were pretty tough about Judge Ramsey -- a little while ago --
And they never proved anything against him.
Except that he disappeared when things got too hot.
Or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.
Whooey -- he took a run-out powder.
Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?
You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.
All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else.
Hey, come here, Sob-sister!
On the square, Jimmy, if you'd seen Winton down there -- I'm not holding a brief for him -- maybe he's a dirty pup, but he's scared and hysterical -- and so kinda dumb and worthless ...
Great! ... If he's worthless we'll give him away as a bridge prize. Come on -- beat it. It's five o'clock. You need some sleep.
No, there's another point I want to iron out.
Which one is me? The horse?
Come in, Prussic Acid. What's on your mind?
I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.
Well, why so mysterious! Come on, spill it.
I am right! I know I'm right!
Listen, Jim -- and if you wisecrack while I'm talking I'll crown you with the inkwell.
All right, wise guy. Go ahead. Spill it.
Jim, there's a little hokey-pokey wax museum opening up down on 14th Street.
Now don't that call for an extra!
I asked you to keep your trap shut!
Well, you can't blame a guy for getting a little breathless with a scoop like that.
All right, you poor baboon, you can guess the rest of it!
No kiddin'. What's your idea?
Just this -- I got a look at that dump a little while ago and if they haven't got a wax figure of Joan Gale in that line-up, then I'm crazy.
We'll grant that.
What!
About the Gale girl, I mean. Where do we go from there? What of it?
Listen, Jo-jo. Does this mean anything to you? Joan Gale's body swiped from the morgue -- Did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask?
I used to be married to one.
And it came to life and divorced you. I know all about that. Now my idea is this: Somebody swipes the girl's body, takes impression, makes a mold, produces wax figure ... Bingo! ... Peddles it to this old skate down there!
Work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it.
Let it go.
Come down to earth. Do you think they would dare do anything like that? Don't you think they'd know that figure would be recognized? Shake your head real hard -- you'll be all right.
All right, Master Mind. But there's something cockeyed about that joint and I'm going to find out what it is.
Oh, by the way, another pet theory of yours just blew up.
What do you mean?
That dear, innocent Judge Ramsey that you were so sure got bumped off for knowing too much has been located in South America.
No kiddin'?
Almost certain.
Mit me, kid. I've got a classic.
You here again like an evil spirit to mar my happiness?
This one's a story, but I'm not going to tell you what it is. Every time I tell you anything it goes haywire.
What do you mean -- haywire? You start out after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers. You start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games. You're grand! I'm for you! Stupendous!
Say, you're always razzing everything I do, but this is one time I'm in.
Go on, little girl, take your troubles somewhere else. I don't feel like talking to you.
Was there any art on Judge Ramsey?
What goofy idea have you got now? Don't tell me you suspect Judge Ramsey of stealing the body.
Listen, stupid, could I do anything that would possibly meet with your approval?
That's what I said.
Yes, sir. I got in the cab and it was layin' there on the floor.
Where were you going when you got in that cab?
I don't remember. Not so very far--
Don't remember what day that was, do you?
You didn't happen to be going to Worth's place, did you?
No, sir, I'm sure it wasn't there.
You used to go to Worth's place a whole lot. What makes you sure it wasn't there?
Call the Homicide Squad!
How's every little thing?
Fine. You're the first reporter in here for two hours. You people seeing the old year out?
I'm people which the old year saw out. I'm canned, fired!
No kiddin'.
I've got to make news, if I have to bite a dog. Hey, Kelly! Oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me.
I've got a story for you. You know the Joan Gale girl?
Yes, she committed suicide yesterday. That's not news. I heard about it last year.
Oh, yeah? Maybe she didn't commit suicide. She may have been murdered!
No foolin' -- any suspect?
Do you know George Winton?
Old Howard Winton's cub?
That's the one.
They don't suspect <I>him</I>?
Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.
Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ...
Why would I string y'? They were sweeties until a month ago.
What does that prove?
Nothing. Only she may have tried to blackmail him. You know such things have happened. Anyway, he was at her apartment a few hours before she was found dead.
Make it snappy, Colonel.
There's an autopsy ordered at Bellevue immediately. You better skip over there.
Don't give this to anybody else, will you?
It's all yours.
Where'd you get the stag hound?
He's not a stag hound. His name is Kelly and he's a police dog.
What do you mean police dog?
Plain-clothes man. Come on, slaves, drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to Washington ... a fate worse than death.
Listen, Flo, cut it out. Hard-Tack is pretty sore.
I told you he was a sore.
Stories scarcer than caviar at a street cleaner's banquet, and he says, bring me a yarn. All I have to do is get a story.
Fine, thanks.
Gee, honey-bunch, I'm sorry -- I'm going to have to disappoint you.
He might get some publicity out of it.
No use. He's a crab, I tell you.
Nix, Flo -- he won't let you in and you'll only get me in Dutch.
What are you people doing out in the middle of the night?
I'm after news, as usual. I wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory?
Well, I'll tell you a secret. I kinda like the old gent and I'm trying to build a special Sunday Magazine story out of him. It might help him a whole lot. But that's a side issue -- something I do on my own time.
Gee, that's great. After the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue. This will pep him up. Have you told him about it?
Ralph, come here a minute, will you?
Yeah. I suppose you people will crucify me for something I didn't do. I didn't! You understand that! ... I didn't do it! She -- tried before --
Come on, old man, that won't do. You know you're innocent until proven guilty.
Listen, kid. You're in a tough spot, and you can make it a whole lot easier for yourself if you cut out the cry-baby stuff --
Cry-baby?
That's what I said.
My lawyers will be on the job in a little while, and I warn you people anything you print about me you've got to prove. Dad won't stand for--
Your dad has stood for plenty. Now let's get down to cases. When did you see the Dale girl last?
For a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --
Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
They didn't give me a chance. We had a couple of drinks and she was all right then. She seemed happy.
Uh-huh. Do you remember what she said? What did you talk about?
She laughed and told me that we were being silly, that we didn't care for each other any more but we needn't hate each other ... ... She said she wanted to be friends.
I see. Was that all she said?
We planned a trip for her. I was going to send her to Bermuda.
You weren't going with her?
No. Why didn't I take her out somewhere? But she was laughing and seemed so happy.
Well, let's get back to the case in hand. They ordered an autopsy and discovered her body had been stolen from the morgue.
Stolen! What are you trying to do to me? ... You're working with the police! ... You're trying to make me say something that can be used against me! You're trying ...
Hold on, hold on. I'm trying to help you, if you're on the square, and I think you are.
Then why are you telling me a crazy lie? ...
That happens to be the truth.
Who'd steal her body?
Now look here. It's not up to us to do our own detective work. I've had enough trouble over this matter. I don't want anything more to do with it.
Not even if it gives you a clean bill of health?
Not even then. The police are the proper people to conduct this affair. Now if you've got any suspicions I'll drive you to the nearest police station.
What! And let every rag in town grab a red-hot story? Not so you could notice it! Now, look, I want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me.
I told you I didn't want to mix in it.
Please. I'm sorry. I'll see it through. What do you want me to do?
There she is! You'll find Joan Gale in that box.
Why?
You go in for dangerous things.
--and so determined to live that I'm going to get out and take a taxi if you don't watch where you're going.
I suppose this is going to sound absurd. I've only known you twenty-four hours, but I'm in love with you.
It doesn't usually take that long, but I'll forgive you -- you were in a tough spot when I met you.
No, really -- I'm crazy about you.
Oh, is that what caused it?
You don't believe me. You think I'm just talking. Will you marry me?
How much money have you got?
Heaven knows. A lot.
What is it? What happened?
You are too gracious. These things have some merit, I suspect ... but this-- ... I am convinced, is fine.
Even those delicate veins, the texture of this flesh -- I have never seen anything more exquisite.
My partner believes that I should build a horror chamber, immortalizing the hideous crimes and criminals of London. At such times Marie Antoinette has reassured me, she has promised me recognition for the devotion I gave to her.
She will undoubtedly keep her promise. If you'll grant me the privilege, I'd like to submit this work to the Royal Academy when I get back.
You will have won the undying gratitude of us all. Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?
I regret I can't spend the time I'd like with your exhibition, but I'm going to worry the life out of you when I come back.
It will always afford me great pleasure to see you.
Good night, sir.
I came back for some of the books. I am trying to straighten out the accounts. I don't hope to impress you, but I may as well tell you: We haven't a farthing!
Your money may have been well invested, my friend. Something important may come of all this.
Something important has got to come of it! Do you know that the rent on this place isn't paid?
Is that a fact?
No -- I'm lying to amuse myself! Now look here, I've an idea that will get us out of all this. We haven't twopence between us, but we've got these.
Fire insurance!
A fire! Is this your idea of humor, my friend?
I want the money back I've thrown into this rubbish heap.
I'm not asking you anything. I'm telling you what I'm going to do!
And you think I will permit this, my friend?
You've got to permit it! Whose fault is it that no one comes here? The museum at Walston Lane does well enough, and why? They've got Jack the Ripper, Burke and Hare, the Mad Butcher, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street and things people pay to see.
And they are welcome to them. To perpetuate such creatures is to celebrate their crimes.
Well, what do you think I'm in this for? Think of it, man, a match -- a cigar stub -- and ten thousand pounds to divide between us!
You're insane.
If my curiosity is not too great, would you mind telling me what manner of animal this is you are designing?
One of the maids-in-waiting for that Elizabethan group.
And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy.
That doesn't seem so bad to me. What is wrong with it?
Everything, my friend. And you hope to be a great sculptor -- A great sculptor. Look -- this forearm is at least two inches too long.
But the composition as a whole -- I've tried to keep a sketchy freedom.
To lunch.
To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.
But I have some friends waiting.
That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
I will only be gone about half an hour.
If you leave before the work is done, you will be gone for a much longer period ... you will be gone for good.
I wouldn't feel too disappointed at the slimness of your audience tonight, Mr. Igor. The weather was against you, and the people are tired and getting over their celebration and preparing to go to work tomorrow.
Have you got it? Is it completed?
Yes, sir, it's here on the truck, but it's pretty heavy -- I'll need help.
Shall we unpack it?
I'd be glad to, Mr. Igor. I think I'll have somethin' to tell you soon.
She is the soul of that statue.
What are you laughing at?
I'd know him anywhere.
Yep. Everything settled.
Good. Well, I'll be seeing you.
I'm glad they didn't hold you downtown.
They didn't have a leg to stand on. There's no case against me. It's a clumsy thing to have happen, but nothing to worry about.
Well, any time I can do anything for you --
To isolation. To an armed camp. To a biblical spoof of a crazed father firing a gun at his only son.
Don't waste it Pauly. This is not an everyday talk. Just input the information and ask relevant questions. One: how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me to this particular switching station?
Two: what if I didn't miss?
You did.
Spare me your classical answer. Measurements in. Results taken. What if I didn't miss?
You did miss --
What was her name?
Excuse me???
Mia...?
I've been dreaming about you.
Could we go somewhere?
I'm heading out of town.
What?
Could you?
Where to?
A place you've never been.
Why am I doing this?
We flopped the first time out.
Could be.
What universe are you in, Paul?
Nothing is real until it's perceived.
The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
Of what?
What did it want?
That's what it asked me. "What do you want?" I didn't answer. I was in the middle of an experiment.
No. I didn't. I'm listening.
She's in L.A., he's in the Bay area --
A five hundred foot thick steel wall. But the connection between these two electrons is so --
Dysfunctional --
That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together --
I didn't want to leave things the way we did. Not this time.
I've been dreaming about this.
Then you get it. You'll understand.
Why?
Yes?
Is Rose here?
She must have gone out for a walk with the children.
Well, I got to see her.
She isn't here. And I'm sorry, but Mr. Hillyer doesn't want her to have callers during working hours.
Where is she?
They're filthy, Mother.
Sex isn't ugly, sex is one of the most beautiful things in life, the creative power of the universe is behind it.
I know, Mother.
But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.
I am in awe of it, Mother.
I don't think you are sufficiently in awe of it. Get the castor oil.
Oh, Mother, not the castor oil.
Lots of things. Buddy, mostly.
Buddy. Well, now, that's a nice name, I like it. I am real pleased to meet you. Hey, look, do you think you got a cold drink of ice water somewhere?
Rose, who were those scoundrels in Birmingham?
Nobody.
But who were they?
They were just bad men, that's all.
In what sense were they bad?
Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no sense to it.
Was that what they tried to do? Was that why Daddy gave you the job, to save you from those scoundrels?
Your Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll say that. He's the best and most kind-hearted man in the world.
Hey, Rose, did you hear about that terrible thing down in Cave Springs?
What terrible thing in Cave Springs?
I didn't hear you. I didn't hear that.
He really did, he ate his little niece. He made pork chops out of her.
I don't hear you. I just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away.
Well, it's only the truth. There are horrible things in the world, Rose.
No, I'm awake. What's the matter?
Buddy, I am wandering in a wilderness, lost. I just feel awful. Do you mind if I get in bed with you for a little while?
I thought I'd go crazy back there in that room all by myself with nobody to talk to. As a child, I never had no room all to myself, we were awful poor. Buddy... I have got a confession to make.
What is it, Rose?
It's so terrible I can't tell you. Oh, Buddy, you don't know how it hurts to have a broken heart, what a terrible feeling it is, and I've had a broken heart so many times. Men, I don't understand them, I can't figure them out and they break my heart, that's all. I can't find Mr. Right, Buddy, I can't find him no matter
What'd you do, Rose?
Buddy, I was horrible. I can't tell you who it was, but do you know what I did? I sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know, a child like you. Why, I let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the
You were pretty bad, huh?
Why, it has just made me ill, Buddy. I'm sick. I don't want to eat nothin', I don't, and me I got a good appetite, that ain't nat'ral for me. I'm ill.
But, Rose, what is the cause of it all?
Promise not to tell Doll? -- or nobody? Buddy, it's your Daddy! I'm so much in love with him I am out of my mind!
But, Rose, how could such a thing as that happen?
Hmmm, it's soft. It's awful soft.
What did you expect?
Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.
Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.
There's some kind of gristle in it, though.
Buddy, quit that, you're just a child, you're not supposed to be interested in such things.
Actually, I am, though.
You know, that Daddy of yours is the funniest man, the things he says, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth next.
Can I put my hand inside your nightgown, Rose?
No, you can't. And I'll tell you this -- he scares me. As kind as he is, he scares me. You can't fool around with him, not with that man. And, boy, I sure better not try nothin' like that with him again, he'll fire me.
Rose, can't I see what the nipple on it is like?
Buddy, what's come over you? A child like you, askin' such things.
Just for a second. Please, Rose, what's the harm?
Buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice.
Aw, come on, Rose, I want to see what the nipple on it is like.
You don' t need to know that. It's none of your business.
Well, are you satisfied now? Can we just lie and talk, huh?
Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right.
'Course it does.
First I couldn't feel it, but now I feel it easily, it's like a little acorn.
All right, that's enough. You're just a child and wouldn't understand it, but that type of thing can stir a girl up. Now lie back and we'll talk.
That was very interesting. Thank you, Rose.
Don't mention it.
It was softer'n I thought, that was my main impression. You know, if you hit a girl there it would hurt her a lot.
Who would want to do such a thing as that?
Well, some fiend might.
You know, Buddy, sometimes I can't figure you out at all. You can be very nice, but like your mother said there's an evil streak in you.
There's an evil streak in everybody, Rose.
There ain't none in your Daddy. You know, what happened has just made me love him all the more. I not only love him, I respect him, I admire him.
Rose, I have a serious favor to ask you.
Most men wouldn't do what he done. If they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her -- I guess to hell they do, just like a dern rabbit. 'Course later they'll tell her she's no good when they done the same thing their selves. They're a bunch of monkeys. I like 'em, but they're a bunch of monkeys.
Why, Buddy, shut your mouth! What an awful thing to say, and where did you get any such idea as that, anyhow?
I'm curious to see what it's like. I'm very curious, Rose.
Well, now that is just too bad! Curiosity killed the cat.
Yeah, but satisfaction brought him back. Can I?
No! You ought to be ashamed of yourself astin' such a nasty things a child your age!
Can't I touch it a little, Rose -- not a lot, just a little?
Of course you can't! I'm... I'm shocked at you, Buddy, real shocked! Now you be quiet or I'm going back to my own bed!
Please, Rose. I'm curious, that's all, I have a natural curiosity, it's only human. You're my friend, aren't you? Don't you like me? I like you, Rose, a lot -- in fact, I love you.
Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.
Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good sport.
Buddy, you're just a child.
I'm thirteen. And I have a natural curiosity. It's only nature, Rose, that's all. Now what's wrong with nature, huh?
You better quit that.
But Rose...
I must be outta my mind. Buddy, quit it.
Am I hurting you?
No. No, you're not hurting me. But I think you better quit it.
But why, if I'm not hurting you?
Rose, are you all right? Are you sick or something?
Buddy, you wouldn't tell nobody, would you?
Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a soul.
I sure hope you don't. I gotta get outta here, good night.
I hate to turn on this light, you Daddy's awake downstairs, but I have to take the chance. Buddy, please don't tell on me.
I said I wouldn't.
Rose, they could stick splinters under my fingernails, and I will never say a word! I will never tell them, because... I love you!
Well, Ill tell you this. I have learned a lesson tonight. I wasn't gonna run around, but when I start botherin' your Daddy and worse robbin' a cradle, I gotta face the facts of life. Tomorrow mornin', I'm gonna get myself up and go out.
You're going to get yourself up and go out?
Here comes Daddy.
Did your Momma really give you castor oil?
Yeah.
Rose, you must know who the fellow is.
I got an awful toothache.
Rose, if you don't keep your boyfriends away from the house, Daddy is going to fire you.
Oh, he's so kind, so gentle inside, and so unhappy with that rich wife who doesn't understand him, her being a Southerner and everything, and what a bedside manner he has got -- so gentle and kind beneath the professor way he acts!
Rose, you are too uncritical of people.
You don't know the bedside manner that man has got. Why, it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin' in his bag like he's gonna cure me, which he did of course. And even more important he loves me, like a patient I mean, the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin' to my
He did?
Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, "You know, you are beautiful." Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more?
Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.
He's got doubts about hisself and that's the saddest thing of all. Would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him?
Yeah, I'd believe it.
Well, I like him. I used to be afraid of doctors but not any more. Why, he could operate on me any old time and I wouldn't even be scared.
Rose, you are just entirely too uncritical of people.
Oh, Buddy, they're gonna cut me all up! They're gonna cut my stummick all open, I'll die!
You won't die, Rose.
I gotta find out what they're saying. You lie back and rest, Rose, and I'll give you a report on it.
Hi, Buddy. How's my sweetheart who never told on me when I was bad?
Okay.
Makin' homes for purple martins, huh? We had 'em on the farm. They're the prettiest things. That's what I wish I was, a bird. Just fly around catch bugs and have a lot of fun.
What are you going to do, Rose?
I guess I'll work as a waitress, Buddy. I done that before and it got me in worse trouble than you could know, but I can't stay here no more. Why did you get rid of your rabbits, Buddy?
They're dumb things. I got tired of them.
Did you know when I was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits?
Five hundred rabbits?
Yep, we had 'em in orange crates all over. It was Daddy's dream. He was goin' to get rich raisin' rabbits. It was what killed Daddy. He didn't drown hisself till a long time later after Momma and Lunette died of typhoid, but it was them rabbits what killed him.
How did the rabbits kill him?
He thought he could sell 'em, but nobody but country folks eat rabbits, Buddy, and they ain't got no money. We had to eat them dern rabbits our own selves. Every dern one, and it took about four years to eat 'em all up.
Well, that doctor said you got protein somewhere and I guess he was right.
Boy did I get sick of rabbit. But later on after Momma died and Daddy wasn't doin' nothin' but drinkin', I sure would of been glad for a little rabbit stew. You know, I oughtn't to of told you about what Daddy done when I was a child. Until them rabbits ruined him, he was a real good man, Buddy.
What was your mother like?
Maybe it was eating all those rabbits that made you sexy, Rose.
Neither do I.
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
Yeah, I know.
Oh, Waski, you don't know anything.
I do, too!
All right, what do you know?
He did lie, and... and... and Mother, yesterday he stole money out of your pocketbook!
Of course not!
You were up late last night, Brother.
Well, a little.
Reading dirty comic bocks. And you admitted it?
Son, was Rose in your room last night?
I never saw anything like it. How did she pick him up so fast?
I don't know.
Is that Doctor still up there, Brother.
Yeah, he's still up there.
What do you think, Brother?
I don't know. But you better watch him like a hawk, if he comes back again.
See that, son? Now this is a heel, see, and there, that's the ball of a foot. Someone has been walking here.
Well, it's not very plain.
That is because it rained recently, the rain has obscured the evidence. But you could still take plaster casts of these footprints, then match up the plaster casts with whosever shoes they are, and that way you could catch him -- understand?
But how would you find him?
Well. Well, what I mean is, you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him. But look this, Brother, it is even more interesting. Look at this mark here, and that mark over there. Now wouldn't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder?
Well, I don't know. No, I don't know, Daddy, I think the rain has obscured it.
See, son? The paint is flaked off here, freshly. Look at it, Brother, there is no question about it. Some person or persons unknown have very recently tampered with this ladder.
Well... maybe...
Open that door, damn you!
Daddy, what's the matter?
I heard you talking. Hasn't Rose come in?
The new girl is here.
Wonderful. What's she like, Brother? What is your impression of her?
Your impression is very reassuring, Brother. Of course she's had troubles, poor thing, but I sensed that was that the girl was like and I'm glad to have it reconfirmed.
You mean confirmed, Mother. I didn't confirm it before. I would have had to confirm it previously, in order for it to be reconfirmed.
All right, all right. Doll and Waski are upstairs taking their nap, you go get them and bring them down to the living room. Where is the girl?
In the kitchen drinking all the ice water in Glenville. She walked out here, she didn't go by the hotel.
Brother, when I have to wake you up at eleven o'clock in the morning you're either sick or you were up very late last night. And you weren't reading Huckleberry Finn. I looked and its not in your room. Now what were you doing?
Mother, I have to tell the truth. I wasn't reading Huckleberry Finn, I was reading one of those Little Dirty Comic Books.
Mother, cant you make it calomel instead of castor oil?
This is for your own good. When you look at negative, destructive things like those little filthy comic books, you are sick. Here, take this.
Geccch, yehh, guhhhh!
Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it.
Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
What did you say, Brother?
I said ahhh-dam stuff.
No, you didn't say that, Brother.
Children, children! Be quiet, all of you! The vibrations in this house are strange today. Where's Rose, anyhow?
She's getting herself up to go out.
What'd you say, Brother?
She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now.
Heh, what a hypocrite.
Excuse me, gotta go to bathroom.
Now I have a plan about Rose, an educational plan. She's getting better and we don't want any more trouble -- Brother, you ought to hear this.
Rose is almost as sentimental as Mother. If there's one thing I can't stand it's sentimentality. In Chattanooga this man committed an almost perfect murder. He killed his wife with a black widow spider.
Daddy says Rose is calm as lettuce. Do you believe that, Doll?
It's pitiful. Neither one of them know.
I think Daddy suspects.
It's really pitiful. She's in bad shape.
She's watching the car again?
Yeah.
There goes Mother.
Yeah.
Let's go peep from the living room.
I think she's gonna kiss him.
I can't see. What are they doing, what's happening?
They're discussing it.
This is my place and you can't have it.
Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?
He's trying to get up -- good God, one of her titties is out!
Now I can't see. What are they doing?
Wow! Brrrother!
What are they doing?
Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it.
What are they doing, Doll?
He kissed her.
Is that all?
He had his hand on her titty.
She's putting the titty back.
Buddy, that was pretty snotty of you, pushing me away like that just when it was interesting.
Wasn't Daddy wonderful? He wanted to kiss her some more and play with her, but he didn't, because he loves Mother and all of us, and he loves Rose, too. Isn't he wonderful, isn't he great?
Wonderful? He kissed her and played with her titty, and I don't see anything so great about that. He was probably afraid Mother would come back early and catch him.
No, Mother, he's lying...
Chattanooga. I had St. Louis, Missouri.
Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.
So am I.
She hasn't got any sense. In some ways, she's awful dumb.
It isn't that she hasn't got any sense, Doll. Her basic intelligence is probably above average, maybe quite a bit above average.
Then why does she act so dumb?
What is Rose going to do? Where can she go?
They've been in there the longest kind of time. I can't stand it, I gotta find out what's going on.
What's happening?
Mother is struggling desperately. In fact she's fighting like a tiger. But I don't know, it's close, it's mighty close.
Buddy... does Rose really... "do it" with all those boys and men?
Well, if she's got any sense at all, she'll listen to that.
What's goin' on?
Rose says she's goin' to have a baby and she sure looks it, but I don't think so.
A baby... and she isn't even married.
That's the least of her troubles. Rose had a rare tropic disease and the little tubes in her that babies swim down are all stopped up, she told me all about it.
Why is it taking so long?
Well, you rascal, where'd you come from?
Hello, Daddy. How are you?
About as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave. Good to see you, son. Did you bring any of that Yankee whisky with you?
It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch.
I can use a drink after the plane ride I had.
Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow?
Are they polar bears, too?
Good God, the way you live here. This place hasn't been dusted since Mother died. Look at that goddamned refrigerator.
Got another twenty years in it, boy. By the way, son, do you recall Rose, that pretty blonde girl who came to our house way back in 1935 or 1936 and caused such a damnable commotion.
Of course I recall Rose. In fact I've been thinking of no one else for the last hour and a half.
How could that be, son?
What's all this about Rose? What do you mean, you heard from her in a manner of speaking?
Oh, I heard from her, I got a letter from her, she's fine. But there is some sad news.
What sad news? Did her cancer come back?
Oh, no, no, she got all over that. Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.
Is her husband sick or something?
The pitiful son of a bitch said Rose was a nymphomaniac.
Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
You're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. He also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over Washington. D.C.
Yeah, I know, he was up here. It's pitiful like you say. When he lost Rose it ruined the man, it destroyed him totally when he lost Rose.
He didn't lose her, he threw her away.
Yes, I guess he did. He threw her away and it was the mistake of his life.
You know, I don't know this town any more. All this traffic, new buildings, prosperity... Where have the years gone, Daddy? Where is the little town I knew as a boy?
At rest in the creative universe with Mother, son.
That's what she would say herself.
A wonderful woman, boy.
It always gives me a funny feeling to come home. Dear old Southland. Gone. It's all gone, Daddy -- -- except you, you're still here.
Not for long, boy. I've outstayed my welcome already.
It's funny you would mention Rose, I was thinking about her all the way up in the car. Or maybe it isn't so funny.
I'm older than hell, boy. But this Yankee whisky is mighty fine, I'll say that.
All right, Daddy. We have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. Rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it?
No, son, she is dead.
Dead, Rose is dead? You mean... she died?
I am afraid so, son. About a week ago. Her husband phoned me, she had asked him to call me if anything happened.
But... but how? She was young! Rose wasn't old!
She was fifty-six, son. Of course she didn't look it, nowhere near it. The cancer came back, I'm afraid I fibbed about that. But it was very quick, son. She was in the hospital only two weeks, and the last week she didn't know anything.
Well, you have knocked me for a hell of a loop, old man. A hell of a loop.
I know. You loved her. So did I. It was an awful shock to me, too. An awful shock. Rose was so alive it's hard to believe.
I can't believe it, Daddy. I know it must be true, but I can't believe it.
Why Rose? Why Rose, Daddy?
Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?
That's a hell of a thing to say. Why, Rose?
Now look, boy, get a grip on yourself. Rose had a good life. She found her. Right, didn't she? She triumphed over everything, what are you blubbering about?
The point is you don't grow up like that on a diet of sorghum and hominy grits. She got protein somewhere, she's a very strong girl and I think she'll live... despite the delay in medical treatment.
Well, it's a disaster. I don't know what to say, Doctor, I am floored. How dangerous is the operation?
Any major operation is dangerous. However, as we know from her previous illness, she's a very strong girl.
Well, if it isn't malignant and she can get through the operation all right, it might be better than her really being pregnant. She doesn't even know who the father might have been.
Go ahead, Doctor, I think I am following you.
First, about the girl's history. Evidently she's been very promiscuous since early childhood, she has no control over her sexual impulses. Furthermore, she is permanently barren, she can't have children.
I am ahead of you.
Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer?
Please do.
I have of course observed the girl in treating her.
Of course.
I think we both know her.
It isn't the fourth dimension. To you it's the fourth dimension, maybe, to me it's simply the truth.
Good morning, sweetheart. Beautiful day.
Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.
How goes it, darlin'?
Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.
Turn up your hearing aid.
What?
Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at me like a snake.
Oh. Did you say something?
I asked you what you think of Rosebud, now that she's been here a while.
Honey, she's perfect. She works all the time and she's wonderful with the children. And they love her, even Brother likes her though he won't admit it. I think she's just perfect.
Um-hmm. Almost too perfect.
And she's such a good-hearted thing, there isn't an ounce of harm or malice in her.
Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet.
There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
Well, let's hope for the best, darlin'.
Hope for the best? I don't understand all this skepticism. I thought you liked Rose.
I love Rosebud, I am wild about Rosebud. I just hope she doesn't turn out to be a hidden hotcha character, that's all. We have growing children in the house.
Hotcha character. If I had to live with your cynicism, I wouldn't want to live at all. What you can't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive, not negative.
All right, darlin', don't go off into the fourth dimension.
I'm not in the fourth dimension -- -- you are in the fourth dimension, when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control. As Blake said, if God had doubt the sun would go out.
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. I don't understand these deeper things the way you do.
Be nice to Rose. She's never had a real home.
I'll drive you, darlin'. You've got no business behind the wheel of an automobile. You don't think about what you're doing and you'll run into a telephone pole.
I think about what I'm doing all the time, and I've got as much business behind the wheel of an automobile as anybody. Besides, I want you to stay and help Rose with the dishes, the poor girl isn't feeling well.
What's the matter, hon? Is anything wrong?
Um-hmm. Well, that is the damndest outfit I ever saw in my life. You walk down the street like that and they'll put you in jail, Rose.
Lay off of that stuff, son. It upsets your mother.
I'm serious. We forget he's just a child. I wish you'd speak to him.
They'll put her in jail. The damn little fool might as well be naked.
Well, it is a little tight. But it isn't as bad as all that. No one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place.
Who doesn't have such thoughts? We'd better get going.
You're not having lunch?
Just half-a-cup of coffee. I never eat, darlin', you know that. Not eating and reverse insomnia are my curses. Let's go, Rose, you and Brother, let's hit the road.
I wish you wouldn't pick on Rose and tease her like that. Of course her clothes are silly, but she's ignorant, naive, she doesn't know any better.
The girl worries me. If she walks down the street like that, an army will be following her.
Well, I admit that outfit isn't very modest. But she doesn't mean any harm, she just wants to attract, attention.
She will succeed.
I don't think you understand her. It isn't sex she wants, it's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it.
That farmer in Gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her, and I'm beginning to see why.
He and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children.
Well, she loves children, all right. She loves everybody.
But that's a wonderful quality, not a bad quality. Have a little patience with her. She's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard.
You are the one who's good-hearted. As for Rose, let's hope for the best.
Be kind to her. She loves you so much. In a perfectly proper way, of course.
Well, she's back.
What time is it?
Quarter of twelve.
Is she all right?
Why shouldn't she go out and have boyfriends?
No reason at all, darlin'.
Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her.
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. All I'm saying is that a girl who would wear clothes like that is going to get in trouble sooner or later.
Well, time will tell, won't it?
That sulky boy was here again this afternoon. I was almost scared, he wouldn't go away.
Well, it isn't Rose's fault boys and men like her. You cant blame her for that, hon.
Oh, shut up, Rose. Shut your mouth and quit crying!
I will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl.
I am not being brutal to her!
You certainly are! She has an awful toothache, look at her jaw, it's all swollen.
-- I am not responsible for her epizootics and I did not bring about her epizootics. Now listen to me. When I have to get up in the middle of the night and defend my home with a shotgun against a couple of damned scoundrels fistfighting in the bushes --
Scoundrels? They weren't scoundrels, they were just boys.
Boys? You say to me boys?
Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of
Now darlin', what has the South got to do with this?
And when I try to talk to you seriously, when I try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life, how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts, what do you do -- you mock me!
Now you listen to me, Rose --
Just a moment! You are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends, not while there is breath in my body!
I don't intend to fire her, darlin'.
It isn't her fault if she's popular... what?
I said I don't intend to fire her. I just want to ask her to keep her boy friends away from my home and hearth, that's all.
I'm sorry, darlin', I hate it as much as you do.
Well, she does seem to cause a lot of trouble, I admit. But she doesn't mean any harm and it'll break the children's hearts, they all love her.
It's because of the children she's got to go. I don't want to be holier-than-thou, but the girl doesn't have the same outlook we do. Morals don't mean a thing to her, not a thing, and we can't have a girl like that in this house.
Who is to say our morals are better than hers? But maybe you're right. She could... influence Dolly...
That is exactly what I'm afraid of. The girl has got to go, darlin'.
But morals come from the heart, not from rigid rules and empty laws. And in her heart Rose has never hurt anyone and she never would. Therefore, she's not immoral. Not really.
Now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension.
How could Rose really be a bad influence on Dolly? She has a loving nature, you ought to want someone like that around your children. Why do you think those boys and men like her?
Well, I have a pretty good idea.
If you mean sex, you couldn't be more wrong. Rose likes those boys and men, she has love in her heart, and that is what they want. It's the most rare and beautiful thing in life and that is why they follow her.
They follow her because she's a -- -- no, I won't say that.
What she doesn't understand is that her behavior is disturbing to other people. She's young, she's got to learn to restrain the life force that's in her. Its creative, but in her case it's too creative.
Darlin', Rose has got to go!
Excuse me, sir, are you calling my wife a liar?
I can't stand that polecat. They ought to hang him.
You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.
Rosebud looked pretty pitiful in that bed. I hope she'll be all right, but I still think we ought to fire her.
Honey, Dr. Martinson isn't a rascal, he's one of the finest physicians in Glenville. He studied at Johns Hopkins University.
I don't care where the polecat studied.
She's like a different person. Being so sick made a big impression on her. I really think she's learned a lesson.
She hasn't actually done anything...
It has been three weeks since I "fired" her. Is there no way to get rid of this girl? Are we stuck with her for life?
She can't get a job, it's a depression. And we can't just throw her out on the street.
She does look a little peaky.
Her plan is obvious, plain as day. She's going on a hunger strike. The question is, how do we foil her?
She's just nervous and worried. And you would be, too, if you had no job and no place to go.
Honey, Rose was born on a farm and has terrible memories of farm life. Now I don't think --
Just a minute, Rose, you don't understand. This isn't a dirt farm like the one you were born on, it's nice. A neighbor of Cousin Hop's, I talked to him on the phone, a fine man... it's not a farm, damn it, it's a beautiful dairy establishment! Stop crying, Rose! Do you hear me? Stop crying, it's ideal!
I don't know how you can call it ideal -- don't you know what the word "farm" means to her?
I don't give a hoot in hell's hollow what it means to her! She can't stay in this house forever! I fired her, damn it!
It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery.
This is a total catastrastroke. As of this moment I am stumped, I admit, I am stumped and treed both, the hound dogs have me surrounded.
You're not going to get anywhere with that line of questioning. The problem is, what are we going to do?
That's why I'm asking her who the father is. It's the most vital question of all. Who's the father, dear?
She already told you, she doesn't know.
Ah, ha! Hold the phone! No forwarding address, huh? In the shock of this brilliant move, I forgot something.
What did you forget?
Honey!
I'd say about three months. Are you satisfied?
This conversation is making me a little sick.
Reluctantly, I do. It would be a blessing to her and everyone else. The girl is oversexed and I say -- spay her!
I thought I knew you. I thought I knew you better, I thought in your heart you were a good and kind man. Well, I can't believe what I've just heard in this room. A defenseless girl depending on you for protection, and you propose to mutilate and destroy her. How could you listen even for a moment to that sadistic man?
Well, now, darlin'... give me a chance to defend myself.
I can't believe you really meant it, if I did I'd want to die. You aren't a male monster, that man is but you aren't. Look me in the eye and tell me, do you really want to take Rose's womanhood away from her when it's all she has got?
Well, I... I hadn't thought about it that much. I was thinking... well, it's an idea, the girl is oversexed, and...
Rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. If you're going to talk nonsense, I don't want to talk to you at all. Rose is exactly the same as the rest of us, except more so.
Well, I know, more so. That's why I was thinking... maybe she'd be better off.
How is she?
It's twenty after one.
I don't understand it. Even in the wild days she was never as late as this.
Why, that looks like Dave Wilkie,
Who?
Well, thank God we are rid of her at last. And the best thing of all is that she's happy. The little nut is happy, she found Mr. Right in the nick of time!
Well, yes, she's happy. Of course Dave doesn't have her life force, not at all. There isn't much furniture in his house, just a table and one or two chairs, whereas Rose has furniture coming out of the windows.
Honey, he is Mr. Right.
Yes, sir.
All right. Now as head of this household I have a couple of remarks to make. It is my dear wife's belief, which I accept although I do not totally grasp it, that to hire a person to do household work is a criminal practice. Therefore, you are here not as a servant, you are here as a friend, as a guest and hopefully
Rosebaby Blossom, these are the most delicious candied yams I ever ate! Why, they just melt in my mouth. And this fried chicken is fit for a king. How do you do it, Peachbird? What is the secret of your art, Plum Blossom, huh?
Oh, I don't know, I... I...
Rosebird Baby, you are the light of my life, darlin'. How did we ever get by without you?
Ahh-hem! Now, Rose, get off my lap. What are you doing, girl? Are you crazy?
Yes, crazy about you! Kiss me, Mr. Hillyer!
Why, I'm not going to kiss you, you crazy girl. Now I'm telling you again, get off my lap. Come on, Rose, get up. Now you get up, I say, and stop this!
All right, all right. Now calm down, Rose, the children will hear you. Calm down, let's talk... about this thing, let's discuss it.
Don't make me... me... me... get up!
Goddamn you, girl! You've made me make a fool out of myself, damn your hide, but let me tell you I am standing at the pass of Thermopylae and I won't budge! The very idea, my own home with children in the house, to say nothing of my wife -- oh-h, you had better believe I am standing at Thermopylae, you little nut, you
Rose, Rose, Rose, you poor miserable little child, don't you know I love you? Do I have to put my hand on your body or kiss your pretty lips to prove it? You are beautiful to me, Rose, I've loved you since you first came here, darlin'. And don't you know Mrs. Hillyer loves you, too, that she's already taken you into her heart,
Oh, I know. She's so sweet, she's been so good to me...
Rose, what are you doing up?
Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
Is anything wrong?
No, sir.
Nothin'. I got myself up, that's all.
Got yourself up?
You're so sweet.
If you've got time before you go "out," get me a half-a-cup of coffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a half-a-cup.
Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens.
That's a pretty stylish skirt, Rose. The only thing I don't understand is how did you ever get it on.
How can the buttons stand the pressure?
What have you got in your hair, girl?
You were up late last night, too, Rose.
Where do you want me to let you out, Rose?
Oh, anywhere downtown.
You don't know where you're going?
Is this ill right?
Well, Rose, my sleep was a little disturbed last night, and so was Mrs. Hillyer's, and so was the children's. How about you? Was your sleep disturbed, too?
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, it was. I... I heard strange voices in the night.
Strange voices, Rose?
Yes, sir.
Ohhh-hh, ohhh...
Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes!
Darlin', I'll take a taxi to the hotel. You and Brother can handle the girl's epizootics. I'll just say one more thing. Rose, I told you you had a friend in Mrs. Hillyer, didn't I, that she would fight for you like a tiger?
Yes, sir.
All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance. But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?
Good morning, Rose. And how do you feel today?
Wonderful. Except I can touch the place back there with my tongue, I wouldn't even know I had that tooth pulled.
Well, I know it, I just got the bill for it.
Boy, for four or five days there I didn't think I'd live. But I'm my old self again!
Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange voices in the night, Rose.
I got an awful bad cold.
That's all you've got to say, you've got a bad cold?
I didn't mean to bite him. He was hitting Horton with a blackjack in the meanest way and... and I bit him accidental.
I have to go back to the hotel. I'm on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive. I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't.
I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
I mean a human investment, Rose, we care about you, you matter to us. But we have innocent and unformed children in this house and the monkey and dog show has got to stop. Do you hear me?
There ain't nobody here, Mr. Hillyer! Honest, there ain't!
And who, Rose, may I ask, is that?
Well, it's Billy.
And what, may I ask, was Billy doing here?
Well, Mr. Hillyer, Billy's very poor, he don't have no money and there wasn't no place else to go.
Well, it was a silly question.
He's a nice boy, you'd like him. He wants to be a fireman.
Ye gods and little fishes, a fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose, you're naked as a jay bird. When you're dressed, come on downstairs. I'm afraid your friend Billy is injured, where are his clothes?
Mr. Hillyer, I know it was bad and I hadn't ought to of done it. But I'm only a human girl and I... I ain't always perfect. I promise I won't let him in the house no more, I promise. Won't you and Mrs. Hillyer forgive me?
Well, Rose, going out to look for a job today?
What's the use, there ain't none.
God forbid. You're not sick, Rose, forget it. Don't get any notions in your head, you're not sick.
Well, I have got news! I called long distance and spoke to Cousin Hop and you'll be glad to know, Rose, I have found you a job!
Tennessee?
Yes, Tennessee, a lovely state!
Well. What kinda job is it?
Ahh-hh, you'll like it. It's a fine, outdoor-type job.
You mean a farm?
I'm not cryin' because of me, I'm cryin' because of somebody else.
What baby? What baby? What baby are you speaking about?
Mine.
Your baby?
Yes, mine. I'm going to have one.
Yes, I am.
No, you're not.
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am.
All right, tell us, Rose, what makes you think you're pregnant?
I haven't had my period for three months and my stomach is getting big.
I don't believe it.
It's so, Mr. Hillyer.
You're looking very chipper this morning, Rose. Sow do you feel?
Perfect, wonderful, good as I ever felt! Except for a big old scar on my stummick, I wouldn't even know I been in the hospital.
Well, we know you were there. The bill that hospital sent was absolutely horrendous.
Rose... I hate to be mean, but... Oh, nevermind, forget it.
What was it, Mr. Hillyer?
Excuse me... your voice is familiar and I'm sure I know you from somewhere...
Awww-rr, Buddy, come on, you know me!
Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see...
It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie, don't you remember me?
Well, I am in the construction business, Buddy, and without braggin' I have done real good at it. There are those who wouldn't have expected that out of me. Right now I'm buildin' a giant motel unit near Alexandria, outside Washington, D.C. Not fi-nance, I'm on the construction side.
Well, that's interesting, Dave. I always liked Washington, it's a pretty town.
Ha ha, course you make a lot more. What's that you got there, Buddy?
Galley proof.
Galley what?
Page proof of a book I'm working on.
How about that. Well, you always were a screwball.
Oh, yeah?
I don't mean that the way it sounds. Imagine it, a book. And I used to know you personal way back when. Tell me something, Buddy, how do you dream up all that stuff?
Well, actually, we have a little black boy named Her---t who lives in the garage. He does it for me.
Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy, always jokin' around. Almost as much of a joker as your Daddy. I saw your Daddy a coupla years ago, I was up in Glenville lookin' at a motel site. I guess that's where you're headed, huh, to see him?
That's right, Dave, I'm headed for Glenville on a whisperin' jet.
Took your time gettin' here.
Tell me about that job in Alexandria, Dave, the big motel you're building.
Near Alexandria. It isn't in Alexandria, it is outside it.
I see. Outside it.
Um-m, well...
Doubted my ability all along, the little bitch. I never remarried, Buddy, you know that, don't you?
Well, no, I didn't actually.
She didn't marry him, though, later she married another guy and went to Winston-Salem. It didn't last That girl couldn't have no lastin' marriage, she left him and married another dumb sucker and went out west. Little bitch left him, too, and you know what she's married to right now? A kike. That's right, some kind of kike horse doctor named Schapiro out in
Dave, you are as full of shit as a Christmas turkey and you know it. Now if you want to start a fight on this plane and get yourself in jail, go right ahead. But I am telling you, you are full of shit right up to your eyeballs.
I don't want to start no fight with you, Buddy. Why do you say I'm full of shit?
Dave Schapiro is no horse doctor and Rose has been a good wife to him for a long time. To call her a nymphomaniac is the most stupid thing I ever heard in my life.
You loved her, didn't you. Well, so did I. You'll have to admit she had four husbands.
Yeah, it took her a while to grow up and find Mr. Right, but she did it. She found him.
She used to call me Mr. Right. Remember that, Buddy?
Well, got to get a plane to Savannah. Great running into you, Buddy. Give my best to your Daddy.
Yeah, I'll do that, Dave.
Ah-h, if you happen to run into Rose sometime... do me a favor, give her a message for me, will you?
You might see her. She writes your Daddy, and she and that doctor came to see him, didn't they? I wish you'd tell her something... I never could write letters.
What do you want me to tell her, Dave?
I don't like that, either, it's worse than Waski. I want to be called Fran.
Yes, dear, what is it?
Daddy, Buddy was up late last night reading little dirty comic books. Mother gave him a dose of castor oil and he cursed it, he took the Lords name in vain, then claimed he hadn't said it. He lied, Daddy.
You mustn't be a tattletale, dear. You mustn't be Delilah-ish and Jezebel-ish toward your brother, dear.
What's the matter with him?
Well, Mrs. Hillyer, the girl is strong as an ox and that is what is keeping her alive. But not many people walk away from double pneumonia, Madam, not many.
She looks terrible, just awful.
Of course she does and I must say I'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital. I should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill.
She hid it from us, Doctor. She's afraid of the hospital.
Afraid of the hospital?
Deathly afraid of it. Her people were poor tenant farmers and she doesn't know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals.
A tenant farm? Are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt?
Well, her people were very poor. She says she was often hungry as a child, and I'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful, not a balanced diet at all.
It's simply that I find it incredible, Mr. Hillyer. Aside from the girl's illness at the moment, she is very strong, a very healthy specimen of a young human female -- and a comely one, too. She must have gotten protein somewhere as a young child, if only sporadically.
Yes, thank you, Doctor.
Oh, good evening, Doctor. Rose is a lot better, I just gave her her supper. She's almost all well now.
Let me be the judge of that, Madam.
I'm not surprised you thought she was pregnant. An ovarian cyst can look very much like pregnancy. But it was pure wishful thinking on her part. The girl can never have children, she had gonorrhea at fifteen and it was untreated.
Gonorrhea?
Don't worry, Madam, she can't infect your dear little kiddies. She long ago fully recovered, but the disease did irreparable damage. The girl is permanently barren.
Well, that's pathetic. Poor Rose, what a life she has had.
We make our own lives, Madam. As for malignancy, I don't think so, it's very unlikely. I probably shouldn't have even mentioned that possibility to her.
No, you shouldn't have, it was needlessly cruel. She thinks she has cancer and is going to die.
I'm sorry the truth nauseates you, Mrs. Hillyer, because before you leave there's a bit more of it I'd like to put to you. This operation provides a therapeutic opportunity that I feel is quite important in regard to this particular girl, who suffers not only from an ovarian cyst but from a certain psychoneurotic condition as well.
Yes, go on.
What are you talking about? I don't understand all this mumbo jumbo and the funny looks on your faces.
Are you human beings or are you some kind of male monsters? Is there no limit to which you won't go to keep your illusions about yourselves?
Illusions, Madam?
I will not cry like a woman. If I'm upset it's because of what my husband said, not because of you. You can't make me cry like a woman, a woman has got just as much intelligence and self-control as a man. And you get this in your head. If you hurt that girl, I'll hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every
Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.
I understand you perfectly. You leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry.
Actually of course I won't operate, I don't do major surgery. Dr. Hardy will operate and of course he'll be guided by your wishes in this respect.
Well, she finally let me look in her mouth. Is it true she's never been to a dentist?
She was raised on a poor dirt farm. I'm sure she's never seen a dentist or hardly even a doctor.
Well, she has one mouth in ten thousand, I don't see teeth like that once in ten years. Her trouble is an impacted wisdom tooth, but there isn't a cavity in her head, not a single one. She has perfect teeth.
But the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled?
Yes, and it's very bad. It probably should be done at the hospital under general anesthesia.
That would scare her to death. She's terrified of hospitals. To her, a hospital is where you go to die.
Rose, this is Waski. His real name is Warren but we call him Waski. He doesn't like it much and I suppose someday we'll have to stop calling him that.
You can stop it right now.
When he was baby we called him "Wa Wa," a baby name, you know. You will find him a very good boy. His brother can be bad and so can his sister, but Waski is a very good boy. And as you can see he's beautiful.
Oh, Mother, cut it out.
Mother... is Rose going to die?
Oh, no, ma'am.
What are you studying now, Mrs. Hillyer?
More history, Rose.
Are you going to get your degree soon?
Well, I am working on my thesis.
It must be wonderful to be so smart. I don't see how you do it, reading all those books, learning all that stuff.
Rose, you work too hard. Why don't you go sit down somewhere and drink a Co-Cola?
Really, why don't you go sit down somewhere?
I like to work. I don't mind work. It's the least I can do after all you and Mr. Hillyer have done for me. You're so sweet. There never was nobody like you.
Well, you run on now.
Rose, you're in an awful dither tonight. What's the matter with you, honey, are you sick or something?
No, ma'am, I'm just fine.
Well, I think it's charming, Rose. But don't you think... ah, the skirt is a little tight?
Yes, Ma'am.
Rose, that scruffy-looking man is out in the yard again.
Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't.
I don't think we ought to discuss this in front of the children.
I don't want to go to the dentist.
Poor thing. Does the ice help, Rose?
Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't never been to no dentist before. He's gonna kill me, I just know it.
I'm not goin' in there, I don't like the looks of it!
Rose, sit down in that chair and be quiet! We're trying to help you, you silly creature, sit in that chair!
Never again, never again...
I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry...
No more dentists, no more dentists...
Rose has learned her lesson, haven't you, Rose?
Rose, you're very sick. You're burning up. Rose, can you hear me? Rose?
You see, Rose? Now that's the kind of dress you ought to wear.
Yeah, it's kinda nice.
You look very pretty in it, Rose. Really, you do.
Well, you're real sweet to make it for me. There never was nobody like you. And you don't need to worry, I ain't goin' out no more.
Well, there's no reason you shouldn't go out, Rose... in moderation.
Rose, you don't look well and you haven't eaten a bit of breakfast.
Well, I... I... I don't know... maybe it was... but no, you can't be sure about a thing like that. It wasn't Billy, I didn't know him.
Oh-h, Mrs. Hillyer, I... I can't think. I... I'm not really sure.
Rose, really, you shouldn't act like that.
Rose, you don't have to.
Don't worry, honey, you'll find something.
I was offered that job as a waitress.
You'll never guess what happened! I have met Mr. Right! I been with him all day and he loves me, I know he does, he loves me and he's going to marry met Be's practi'cly ast me already!
Well... well, that's wonderful, Rose.
I... I can explain...
I'm looking at this poster, and I'm thinkin', I don't remember seeing films like this when I was in school.
I was going to tell him.
What were you gonna say? Exactly how did you think he was gonna make the leap from dating a sweet, innocent school teacher to an ass-fucking porn star?
Let me tell him. Let him decide.
You're not gonna see him again.
What... what makes you think you can order me around?!
Hasn't he got enough problems, or didn't you notice that's not cream soda on his breath?
Indivisible and inseparable.
Incestuous.
What Eve and I wouldn't give to meet up with you on the business end of a daisy chain.
Put up your kickstand, freak. Start talking, or we're out the door.
How much?
I figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten.
You think it's that good?
I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.
You get nothing and like it. And if we're not blissfully happy with what you tell us, we arrest you just for the fun of it.
And... ?
What and? That's what I got.
A Lincoln? What Lincoln? Lincoln Continental? Lincoln Mark Five... Six... ?
Now you know what to watch for...
Have I ever steered you wrong?
Take her down to the car, and for Christ's sake be careful this time. Last suspect he took in, butter-fingers dropped her down the stairs. What a mess. Why is it we don't appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
Hey, listen... I'll give you something else, Kittle. Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach? It was never identified...
Who cares?
Alright, wait... there's a dentist in Brentwood peddling morphine...
Come on, don't you screw with her, please! You... you got to want this: armored car job. CalTrust Bank. They took two million in cash...
We'll take the CalTrust heist, but if it's no good, we will hunt you down, and Billy-Boy will pull out your spine and he will beat you to death with it.
This is private property. This is breaking and entering!
You're Zimmermann's calculator, Archie. All the blood money you had to move around to make this deal, you got to know something. Maybe they told you, maybe you overheard things you weren't supposed to hear...
I'm telling you, you're barking up the wrong tree.
Well, I'm running out of trees, so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you don't know! Convince me!
It's six o'clock. Time's runaing out. Decide.
If I tell you, how do I know you won't just club me and take it back?
Three hundred kilos of White Lady hidden inside a giant bust of Abraham Lincoln. A parade float.
What... ?
Kittle...
What do you want? I'm clean. I been clean a long time.
Oh, you fuckers! You fucking fuckers! What? What do you want?
Hey now... what the fuck... ?
Know what he's doing, Benny? He's trying to jog your memory.
I don't know what you're talking about, man. Even if I did, I'm not so crazy I'm gonna cross Zimmermann.
Last time Billy-Boy did this, the guy's neck broke... ... just like that. Sad in a way. Why is it we don't truly appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
It's bone dry out there. Everybody's hurting. The stuff floating around's been cut so many times it's like powdered sugar, but Zimnermann's gonna fix it.
I need the "when" and the "where."
How's your precious little school-marm today?
She's fine, as if you cared.
Tell me something... what's a school teacher doing having you meet for breakfast in one of the filthiest parts of downtown skank-ville? I mean, this is not the place for fine dining, unless looking at prostitutes stimulates your appetite.
Filthy kids go to kindergarten too. What are you saying, anyhow?
Nothing, I guess. Just an observation. She's really something special. You're a lucky fella.
Lay off once, would you?
What'd I say?
She's right. If you two are doing the horizontal polka, the last thing you want is a thirty-five pound bundle-of-joy stumbling around, knocking over furniture and calling you "daddy."
Jeez... it's too early in the morning for this. Leave off. Here's your paper.
You shouldn't litter.
Thank you, concerned citizen.
Give a Hoot. Don't Pollute.
Just a little, you know... Bicentennial memento. Nothing special.
Escort everyone's favorite She-Male over here nice and peaceful-like. Let's not have another incident like at the laundromat. I'll never forget the look on that poor woman's face.
That wasn't my fault.
I... I can't find my seatbelt.
Sons of bitches!
We catch 'em, I wanna be first to hurt 'em. Promise me I get to go first.
I can work this.
No you can't.
Make a hole, Billy-Boy.
I'd rather you guys didn't do this again.
This is too fast. This is <U>way</U> too fast!
Relax.
We should slow down.
Jiminy Christmas.
I say, fuck 'em. Let's go.
Well... we shouldn't rush into this, right? Let's talk about it.
What are you, Henry friggin' Kissinger all the sudden?
I'm just saying...
You're just saying nothing! Tonight is the night.
Yeah, but if we don't sit, they'll take our badges.
All I got is being a cop. What do I do if I'm not that?
We shoulda been there to back you up. We shoulda!
Ah, jeez, Billy... careful!
"A.D."
Where you gonna be?
No offices are gonna be open today.
Okay, we got... one, two... three... Two Caddies and Poe's Mustang.
Remember those two uniform cops who been giving us such a hard time... ?
Yeah.
The ones you got in that fist-fight with a couple a weeks ago... ?
Yeah.
That's them trying to kill us.
Look, Kittle... pull over and let me out. I'll be fine... okay? How 'bout that... ? Oh, Lord almighty, listen to me... I don't want to die!! Lemme out of this coffin!!
Clench your teeth.
Wh... what... ?!
That's sick.
What's the plan?
When you planning to cut back on that?
What?
The booze.
I don't know what the problem is. Plenty of great men throughout history got their bravery out of a bottle
Name one.
Dean Martin.
Who's been giving you history lessons? Your bartender?
Okay, seriously. What about Napoleon, huh?
What about him?
They... they shot me.
They shot us all, kid.
What day is it?
Where we going?
How you doing back there?
Gimmie a butt.
You don't smoke.
Happy Independence Day.
Why do I always have to sit in back?
It's just the way things are, kiddo.
Well, I would like to sit in front today.
You been wearing rubbers, Billy-Boy?
Wha... ?
Birth control's important.
You know, the more weight back there, the faster the car goes.
Bullshit.
You never heard of physics, Einstein? The laws of physics. The more ballast we keep closer to the rear tires...
I'm back here, aren't I? So, you don't have to make up a buncha lies to make me feel good about it.
What's mine say?
"Leo. The stages of the moon are in alignment, so now is a perfect time for a vigorous regimen of self improvement. Wash yourself more carefully each morning, stop using pies and cakes as your primary source of nourishment, and quit tucking your shirttails inside your underwear."
It doesn't say that.
Hey...
That's him alright.
Smooth move, hot-shot.
Laugh it up. You'll cry later.
What the... ?! What was that for?
Follow me.
Where we going?
Okay. But, what changed our mind?
Let's go! Fuck everything! God damn sons of bitching mother humpers... I'm gonna rip'em all brand new assholes... !
I can't believe we're stealing.
We're not stealing. We're borrowing.
No, we're stealing.
This is the police lock-up. We're police. How can we steal from ourselves?
Who said it wa's me, hub? Anyway... he fell off a ladder. It wasn't really my fault.
You live like a pig.
Can't you say something nice once?
Bad news is, word's spreading like wildfire that we don't have badges, and nobody wants to end up getting splattered like Butch Cassidy either.
If we don't catch a break soon, we're gonna be left standing with our dicks in our hands.
Whoa, whoa... it's gonna be alright.
Don't talk like that. There's plenty of women around for jerks like you.
You plan on shooting that gun or just hugging it?
What about Jack Daniels? Wasn't he a decorated general in the Civil War?
No.
General Jim Beam, then.
Nope.
Billy, I love you I really do... but I've got to tell you, every day, in every way, you give new meaning to the word "stupidity."
You could start over again with cash like that.
Feels like there's a bullet still in my chest.
There probably is.
He tried to kill us.
Hey now, look! Let's all get on the same page here. This shipment is do or die for Zimmermann's syndicate; all or nothing. If we stop the drugs, we don't even have to catch him red-handed. He's ruined cause his pushers go broke with nothing to sell. On the other hand, if we fuck this up, it means more zombies crawling the gutters than
There'll be other chances.
I'm gonna put a great big, ear-to-fucking-ear smile on your face. How 'bout that?
Where have you been?
Our resignations.
You going rogue on me?
Maybe.
What happened, Kittle? We used to be friends. You used to know how the game was played.
You mean taking bribes, and skimming busts and letting hoods walk? You mean not being able to sleep at night after shaking down some honest Joe?
It's noon straight up. Effective immediately, you three work desk jobs till midnight.
You can't be serious.
Can't I?
He went to pick up lunch.
Well, shake a leg. Get these files downstairs... And, quit listening to your fucking voodoo music.
And, what... what am I forgetting? Oh, yes... the transvestite junkie whose bullet riddled body came blasting through the front doors of the precinct house!
Well, sir...
No. Don't open your mouth! You <U>honestly</U> think you can explain this to my satisfaction?
I... I think I can... clarify...
Don't bother. This behavior's gone on too long. You're suspended.
Don't you condescend to tell me how or why to honor Independence Day, and don't tell me I'm overreacting when I'm trying to bust the guy responsible for half the filthy junk coming into this city!
You're about an inch away from insubordination!
Well... seeing how you just suspended me, what's to stop me from calling you a crazy bastard, you old fart?
What can we do for you, officers? What new, mindless harassments have you planned this morning?
Just wanted to make you aware... before today's over, we'll be standing on top of your mountain of horse and pissing down on you.
Couldn't have said it better myself.
You bust some small-time pimps, whores and dime-bag junkies, like the world's a better place because you're in it. And for what, Kittle... two hundred and fifty dollars a week? Tell me, how does anyone get so self-rightious when they can barely afford to pay their rent?
Just 'cause you belong to some fancy-pants club, doesn't make you any less a murderer.
Thanks, but we don't recognize "brunch" as an actual meal.
Your poison's not gonna make it into the veins of any kids this time.
You fuckers... damn you! Why?! Why me!? Why the obsession with me?
It's our job.
Pardon me... my mistake. Taking your thoughts in hand, huh... ?
Pure horse.
Arriving tonight
Why do you bother with that mumbo-jumbo crap? Some fruitcake's writing it between bong hits, making it up as he goes, and you're actually taking the time to read it.
Yeah, non-believer? Here's yours... "Scorpio, October 24 to November 22: Jupiter is in conflict with Saturn, so proceed with caution..."
Look out! Jupiter and Saturn'll get you every fucking time.
"Today you have a rare opportunity to make a big difference in your chosen field. By your able leadership and with great conviction and strength of character, you will come up a winner."
Yeah... great.
You know... you could say thank you.
You're the one with the star-spangled hard-on, not me.
I just think you should show some respect. I mean, call me old fashioned, but 200 years ago when Ben Franklin and those guys signed the Constitution and Declaration of Independence, they did that so we could all share in the freedom...
First of all, the Constitution wasn't writtem till 1787...
You know what I mean.
Second of all, the Declaration of Independence was all for liberty and equality, but it didn't do anything about slavery, did it?
Yeah, well... nobody's perfect. They couldn't go doing everything at once.
Alright?
We got him.
Slow down.
"Go, go, go!" "Slow down." Make up your mind.
Hold your horses, sweetpea. We need Butch Cassidy alive, remember?
If they crash, maybe he'll run. You can shoot him in the leg or something.
I'm gonna get beside him.
I'm gonna get beside. Nena, you're gonna shoot out his tires.
You... SUCK! You almost got us all killed!
You think this is so easy?
Can't be worse than you.
Oh yeah?
That's right, white bread. Give it up. Right now.
Get closer! Don't lose him!
You put your bumper just behind his left tire and then accelerate... make him spin out...
What... ? Not you too?
He's right. We hit the bricks, we walk back triple-fucked.
I can't believe I'm hearing this,
I worked my ass off for my badge, Kittle, It's the only thing that makes me different from every other slob out there.
That's not true.
Yeah, my arms healed up real good, and that's how I wanna keep 'em. That's what I'm trying to tell you.
You need a doctor.
Any preferences?
Let's get this thing done.
Alright, flesh-peddler, let's see empty hands!
You get him?
Dead.
If it is, that's pretty high up on the totem pole. What do you think?
Alright... how about you two hit the strip and start knocking some heads together? Find out who "A.D." is. I got a quick errand to run.
Been waiting long?
Just got here.
How'd we do?
A.D. is a C.P.A.
Come again... ?
Archibald Dobbs; Certified Public Accountant. But, that's all we got.
Get his attention.
Hey-Ho... ! Maybe we're not alone in this thing after all.
What the hell's his problem?
You're... you're not doing what I think you're doing... ?
You suck at lying, Archie.
See... now that we know you know, the hard part's done for us.
We're screwed.
This much powder you don't throw in the trunk with a blanket over it. It's got to be smuggled.
No more counting the big money for someone else.
Think Zimmermann's watching?
You John-Wilkes-Booth-ed him.
Why the beach?
Oh, yeah... the explosion.
Know what I love about dynamite?
Do tell.
When you bunch it together, it's exponentially more powerful. Two sticks have the power of four sticks. Four sticks have the power of sixteen, and so on.
I don't think so.
The gang's all here!
You see that?
Yeah.
You always did have style.
It's one of a kind.
This shit was Ming.
Where's your pet gorilla and the female Uncle Tom?
They're... around.
Yeah? So, what do you want to ask today that I can't answer? I'm a busy man.
The way Zimmermann takes such good care of you and this drug-peddling "escort service" of yours, I figure you got the scoop on the pharmaceuticals arriving tonight.
Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.
All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.
You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.
We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.
At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.
The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor.
I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.
You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.
There's still good in him.
I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
I can't do it, Ben.
You cannot escape your destiny.
I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.
To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are
I can't kill my own father.
Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
Yoda spoke of another.
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
But I have no sister.
Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.
Leia! Leia's my sister.
But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
I can't see.
Your eyesight will return in time.
Where am I?
Jabba's palace.
The Death Star will be completed on schedule.
You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
Yes, my Master.
Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.
As you wish.
What is thy bidding, my Master?
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.
What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.
I told you to remain on the command ship.
I have felt him, my Master.
They are clear, my Master.
Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things.
Han!
Luke!
Are you all right?
Fine. Together again, huh?
Wouldn't miss it.
How are we doing?
The same as always.
I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
Luke.
You got her warmed?
Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?
Vader's on that ship.
I don't know. Fly casual.
I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.
I thought she was with you.
Take the squad ahead. We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach.
Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing. Han, can you reach my lightsaber?
Hey!
Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Someone who loves you.
Leia!
I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!
Hey, are you awake?
Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.
Shall we try and go around?
What's going on?
I...
I'm sorry.
The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
The code's changed. We need Artoo!
I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.
He wasn't. I can feel it.
Yes.
Han! Chewie?
Lando, grab it!
Lower it!
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.
No, wait! I thought you were blind!
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.
Well, look at you, a general, huh?
Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet.
Good luck.
Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.
Good, I hate long waits.
In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.
Here we go again.
What are you telling them?
Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
Proper?!
What did he say?
We're coming!
Come on! Come on!
My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?
Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence.
I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.
We shall double our efforts.
All wings report in.
Good shot, Red Two.
I'm going in.
Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.
There it is!
All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.
Ugh!
Oh!
What's he saying?
Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!
Quiet.
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
Over there! Two more of them!
Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
What do you remember?
Just...images, really. Feelings.
Tell me.
I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.
Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?
He's my father.
Your father?
Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.
Yes. It's you Leia.
I know. Somehow...I've always known.
Then you know why I have to face him.
No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
No, you don't. You've always been strong.
But, why must you confront him?
The Emperor has been expecting you.
I know, father.
Come with me.
You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
If that is your destiny.
Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
Obi-Wan has taught you well.
Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict.
There is no conflict.
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.
You cannot hide forever, Luke.
I will not fight you.
Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.
Master Yoda, you can't die.
Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
Yoda, I must know.
Told you, did he?
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
Well, I'm sorry.
Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
Yes or no will do.
Oh. Well, yes.
How many languages do you speak?
I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...
Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.
Do you have any tattoos Brad.
Certainly not!
You!
Why you - what have you done with Janet?
You tricked me. I wouldn't have - I've never - never.
I know, but it wasn't all bad was it? I think you found it quite pleasurable. Oh so soft. So sensual.
Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet. Janet.
Shush. Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?
Like this. Like how? It's your fault - you're to blame. I thought it was the real thing.
You promise you won't tell?
I see. So this wasn't simply a chance meeting. You came here with a purpose.
I was telling the truth.
I know what you told me, Brad. But this Dr Everett Scott. His name is not unknown to me.
He was a Science Teacher at Denton High.
And now he works for your Government, doesn't he, Brad? He's attached to the Bureau of Investigation of that which you call U.F.O's. Isn't he, Brad?
He might be. I don't know.
Janet!
It's as if we were glued to the spot.
The future is ours so let's plan it.
Janet.
So please don't tell me to can it.
Janet.
Janet.
Made me give you the eye And then panic,
Yes.
Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.
Yes.
And Ralph himself will be in line for promotion in a year or so.
Yes Brad.
I've got something to say.
Uh huh.
I really loved the skilful way You beat the other girls To the bride's bouquet.
Oh Janet
Oh Brad, I'm mad.
Gosh. That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us. They certainly take their lives in their hands. What with the weather and all.
I think we took the wrong fork a few miles back.
Oh dear! But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
What was that bang?
We must have a blow-out.
You'd better sit here and keep warm while I go for help.
But where will you go? We're in the middle of nowhere.
I'm coming with you.
There's no point both of us getting wet.
Oh, Brad. Let's go back. I'm cold and I'm frightened.
Yes, the rain has been very heavy.
Oh Brad, I'm frightened. What kind of place is this?
Oh....Say something.
Brad, please lets get out of here.
For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
But it seems so unhealthy here.
It's just a..a party Janet.
Well I want to leave.
We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.
Then ask the butler - or someone.
Let's wait awhile Janet. We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
They're probably foreigners with ways different from our own. - They may do some more folk dancing.
Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.
Right!
Oh Brad.
I'm Brad Majors and this is my fiancee, Janet Vice.
Weiss.
Brad...
Oh Brad - Mmmm - Oh yes, my darling - what if...
It's alright Janet. Everything's going to be alright.
Oh, I hope so my darling. But let me switch on the light.
No, don't do that.
Maybe we could try it this way.
Janet! Oh! Yes it's alright. Janet. Everything's going to be alright.
I'm engaged to Brad just the same as Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses.
I could see Brad's face before me and my mind screamed No! But my lips were hungry - too hungry.
So baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow After the night there's a brand new day. And there'll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It'll be O.K.
I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly. Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to beat again. So give me a sign That a lover makes You look around The one you've found Is back again.
Hello.
Uh - oh - Hi! My name is Brad Majors. And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss. I - ah - wondered if you could help us. Our car has broken down about two miles up the road. Do you have a phone we might use?
Great scott - Scotty - Dr Everett Scott.
You know this earth - this person.
Good God.
Great Heavens, that's a laser.
You did right.
A decision had to be made.
You're OK by me.
Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.
Yes, well perhaps it was for the best.
Well. I don't like men with...er, with too many, muscles.
You beast, you monster, what have you done with Brad?
Nothing. Why, do you think I should?
You tricked me - I wouldn't have - I've never - never
Ssssh. Brad's probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you like this?
Like this - like how? It's your fault. You're to blame. I was saving myself.
Promise you won't tell Brad.
What a guy
What guy
"Sweet Transvestite"
From Transexual Transylvania.
"Transylvania"
On the day I went away.
Goodbye
Was all I had to say
Now I
Want to come again and stay
Oh my, my,
Feeling
Like I'm outside in the rain
Wheeling
Free to try and find a game
Dealing
And left from my dreaming Was a feeling Of un-nameable dread.
That ain't no crime
Oh, no no, no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
No no no, no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Oh no no no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
No no no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime. That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
No no no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
No no no no.
I think you had better both come inside.
Are you - giving a party?
No. You've arrived on a rather special night. It's one of the master's affairs.
The Master is not yet married. Nor do I think he ever will be. We are simply his servants.
Who's Eddie?
Creature of the night.
I thought you liked them. They liked you.
Our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister, soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our "androgenous" planet.
Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains. To take that step to the right...
But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane.
...How's the turtle food this week?
...Fine.
Me, I'm kinda aggravated.
...I'm sorry.
I smack 'em hard on the shell an' they get... What?
...I don't know.
Hey, how's my buddy doin'? -- Nice dog -- Well, I'll see ya later.
It's Thanksgiving.
Looks quiet, y'know.
I think it's closed.
...Aren't you skating?
Ain't skated since I was fifteen -- That's when I started fightin' -- gotta watch the ankles. Yeah, fightin' use to be tops with me, but no more. All I wanted to prove was I weren't no bum -- That I had the stuff to make a good pro.
But you never had a chance to prove yourself.
I just dislocated my finger.
Y'know how I got started in the fight racket?
What's funny?
Some people are very shy by nature.
...I suppose.
I would say you're very shy by nature.
...I suppose.
Some people think bein' shy is a disease, but it don't bother me.
It doesn't bother me either.
Then why did I bother bringin' it up? 'Cause I'm dumb, that's why... Y'know, I think we make a real sharp coupla coconuts -- I'm dumb an' you're shy.
...It is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter.
Ya gotta be a little soft to wanna be a pug... It's a racket where ya' almost guaranteed to end up a bum.
I don't think you're a bum.
...I'm at least half a bum. Yeah, fightin' is a crazy racket. The roughest part is the mornin' after.
Morning after?
After a rough fight, ya' nothin' but a large wound. Sometimes I feel like callin' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom... Ya' eyes hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair even hurts... But the thing I'm proud of is I been in over sixty fights an' never had a busted nose -- Bent an' twisted an' bitten but never broke...
Why do you do it if it hurts so bad?
...Guess.
Would ya like a glass of water?
Here's the guys I was tellin' ya about -- This is Cuff an' Link.
I sold them to you.
...Oh, yeah, I bought the whole kit -- Yeah, ya sold me the turtles, the bowl, an' the mountain -- I had to get rid of the mountain 'cause they kept fallin' off.
Do you have a phone?
I had it pulled. People callin' all the time. Who needs it -- Who'd you wanna call?
I wanna let my brother know where I am.
D'you really wanna call?
Yes, I do.
You sure?
Yes.
Why?
I think he might be worried.
What's the matter? Ya don't like the room?
It's fine.
It's only temporary.
It's not that --
What's the problem? You don't like me -- Don't like the turtles -- What is it?
I don't think I belong here.
It's okay.
No, I don't belong here.
It's all right -- You're my guest.
...I've never been in a man's apartment before.
They're all the same.
I'm not sure I know you well enough -- I don't think I'm comfortable.
Yo, I'm not comfortable either.
I should leave.
Would ya take off your glasses?
What?
...T-thank you.
Do me another favor?
...What?
I always knew you was pretty.
How'd ya like hearin' ya name on TV?
I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?
Ya puttin' me on, right?
Absolutely -- What time should I expect you?
'Bout seven.
Y'know how I said that stuff on television didn't bother me?
Yes.
Don't you open them anymore?
Like?
Sharp -- Real nice.
Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine?
Adrian, you really look great, y'know -- But I can't fool around durin' trainin' -- makes the legs weak.
Don't want weak legs.
Can't fool around -- You look very great.
-- The legs.
I thought it might be cute.
...And he called the reporters --
Yeah... Threw my whole day off.
Don't be mad at him -- He just wants to help.
Yo -- I ain't mad. I'm just outta joint when reporters are around -- They take cheap shots an' Paulie knows it.
...Are you going to say anything to him?
Wanna hear a dirty joke?
Rocky, do you realize everybody in this country knows your face, and after the fight everybody in the world is going to.
What was that you said about a pet shop?
...What?
What did you say about a pet shop?
I don't want ya cleanin' nobody else's cages no more.
Is everything all right?
...Can't do it.
...What?
...I can't beat him.
Apollo?
I been watchin' the movies -- studyin' -- He ain't weak nowhere.
What're we going to do?
...I dunno.
Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.
It ain't so bad, 'cause I was a nothin' before --
Don't say that.
...Paulie, why didn't you tell me you were bringing him home?! Look at me, I'm not ready for this.
Like it would make a difference if you were, right? This guy's a friend and now he's takin' ya out.
No... I can't!
Ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom an' I don't wanna know from nothin'.
Paulie, please --
Hey, I want ya out instamaticly. -- I'm sicka lookin' at ya hangin' around like a friggin' spider -- Go out -- Live! Do, enjoy life.
...Like you?
Don't get wise with me. I want ya to stop bein' a loser.
I can't go out.
Why?
Do me a favor -- His lungs, punch 'em out.
Oh, Rocky!
Christ.
Einstein flunked out of school... twice.
That so.
Nothin'! I want nothin' from you!!!
Paulie!
Shutup! I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!
It's not your house --
You ain't no friend no more -- Go home! Outta my house I want ya!
Don't talk like that to him!
...Paulie. Stop now!
I want 'im outta here -- Don't think I'm good enough to work for Gazzo? That's what I think of bums like you an' Gazzo! You're goin' up an' don't care enough to throw Paulie some crumbs! I give ya meat, an' I give ya my sister, too!
You forget what I went through to give ya the best.
You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
Don't do that again!
Get away from me -- I could never even get married 'cause you couldn't live by yaself -- ya'd die by yaself! So instead I put you two together -- Did ya think of puttin' in a good word for me? -- You owe me!
Owe you what?
You owe me an' are supposed to treat me good!
You busted?!
What?!
I do -- Maybe what this fight needs is something new -- a novelty.
You's the novelty, Champ!
Too old, dull fighter. Bobby Judge is a good boy.
He won't last one round.
Listen, I gonna carry this boy three rounds, then drop 'im like a bad habit.
I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong.
...That boy damn near broke my arm.
Sure -- He can hit -- Don't play no more -- Stick an' move, hear?
I'll carry him 'till the third.
Man, I rearranged his face with that right -- The people love what's happenin' tonight.
...That man's takin' his job too serious.
He's movin' to your left -- don't let him no more -- dance and stick, hear? Don't play -- I know what ya feelin', but don't play.
He got lucky.
My side.
Get that doctor.
No doctor!
You're hurtin', man!
Yo' bleedin' inside, man -- Get that doctor.
One more round.
Don't kill yourself, man -- Let the doctor stop the fight.
...Stop jivin'!
Cover the ribs -- Look here, elbow down, tight -- Tight -- stand straight -- you're the best, you're the best!
Damn.
You best find me another ranked contender an' I mean in a flash, man!
I contacted Ernie Roman's manager, he's fighting in France the same week.
Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.
Shape, nothin' -- They're afraid. They know everybody in the world's gonna see this fight an' none of them gotta prayer of beating me so they're makin' excuses so they don't have to be the chump that's gonna be whipped in front of the whole civilized world!!
Now here's what's goin' down. Listen, 'cause I'm gonna say this but one time. On January first, the first day of the Bicentennial I'm gonna fight me a local poor underdog, dig? A snow-white underdog. An' I'm gonna put his face on this poster with me, hear? An' I'll tell you why, 'cause I'm sentimental -- An' all the people in the country all
...It's very American.
How 'bout this Billy Snow?
Fouls.
Joe Zack is a good prospect -- Exciting boy.
...Still don't feel no heat.
Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo?
'The Italian Stallion' -- He's my man.
Rocky Balboa -- His record's poor --
How was the flight, Champ?
Apollo, how would you rate this last British challenger, Henry Wilcoxson?
He was big, an' very nasty so I destroyed him in a hurry -- Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac Lee Green next month.
You're referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight?
That's right -- It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- A gala occurrence!
Still to be held in Philadelphia?
The Bicentennial Heavyweight Championship of the World is gonna be held in the only place it can be held -- Philadelphia! -- the nation's cradle -- January First -- the first major event of our two hundredth year.
Me an' my wife are goin' home 'cause we miss our children an' can't go no more time without seein' them.
Any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls?
Did ya get the license number?
Of wa?
Hear she's retarded.
She ain't retarded, she's shy.
Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards like the zoo.
I don't like ya face.
Don't like yours neither.
Kiss my ass.
Yo, Rocks, buy us sum wine, man.
...No wine -- Bad for ya' brain.
C'mon, man, it's cold, man.
No wine.
Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar.
Why?
'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme a dollar.
No dollar.
...That's an old one.
We'll kill you, man -- We gotta gun.
Hey, whatta ya doin' here -- we're closed... Yo, we're closed!
Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody.
Hey, the rink is empty 'cause we're closed -- ya ain't allowed in here so do me a favor an' not stay here.
Yo, pal, what's with you -- The place ain't operatin'.
Listen, I gotta problem. This girl ain't feelin' well, y'know -- The doctor says she should exercise, y'know once in awhile an' ice skatin' is the best thing --
This a con?
Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --
Few minutes?
...Ten minutes.
Ten minutes for ten dollars.
Nine minutes!
Seven minutes!
It ain't your fault -- I originally done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight. That's me fightin' Big Baby Crenshaw -- Big Baby was the size of an airplane an' I broke my hands on his head -- I lost, but it's a nice picture, don't ya think?
Six!
How 'bout some Cokes?
Cost ya a buck.
Here -- Three minutes.
That's ten bucks.
...How 'bout for the Cokes?
We would like to welcome our viewing audience to the Grand World Championship Bicentennial Heavyweight Fight -- the first major event of the Bicentennial Year... A point of interest is that the fight is being beamed to more than seven hundred and fifty million fans in theatres in nearly every corner of the world. I would like to welcome an old friend, and co-commentator
Thank you, Bob. The electricity is everywhere tonight. Rocky Balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a Cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'The fighting style should be 'The Caveman Against the Cavalier.' From the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... His record is forty-four wins, twenty
You could go deaf with the noise -- it undoubtedly means Champion Apollo Creed is heading towards the ring --
Am I seeing right? Creed is approaching the ring in a boat. Is he supposed to be George Washington? Obviously so.
It's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of George Washington -- a great way to start 1976 off.
The Champ stings the slower challenger with jabs at will -- Balboa blocks eighty percent of the blows with his face -- Creed doesn't look the best he's ever been but is moving smoothly -- Creed snaps out a triple combination that backs Balboa into a corner -- oh, a solid hook by Creed, a master of fist-men.
The Champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- Another left to right combination. I feel sorry for --
If you had asked anyone who knows boxing, they never would've predicted a first round knockdown and the second round punishment to the body of the Champion... Most fighters will tell you, receiving a good body punch is the next worst thing to dying.
Apollo almost sprints out of his corner -- feints and throws a pair of left-right combinations. Balboa drops beneath a left upper cut and lands a very solid shot on Creed's temple -- not much movement from Balboa, duck a left, a right, another left and explodes with a right hook to the temple -- I mean explodes. The Champ backs off.
There's no way Apollo expected this kind of hitting power.
Without a doubt this is the most punishing brawl I have ever seen -- The ringside audience is spotted with blood. This fight should have been stopped rounds ago but Rocky Balboa refuses to fall --
I say ya nothin'!
What's happenin' here?
You can forget about sparring, kid.
Yo' know I iz the best man here! Yo' said so yoself!
Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand? -- Take a shower, Dipper.
Yo' yellow, old man.
Don't hit the face! Not the face!!
Mr. Gazzo wants the two hundred now!
Honest to God I'm broke -- Gimme a break.
Mr. Gazzo says I should get two hundred or break the thumb.
What's ya name again?
Bob.
A hundred an' thirty.
That's it, I'm broke.
That's it? -- Completely?
That's it.
What about for food an' stuff?
...The juice is climbin' every week.
I know the juice is climbin' -- I been workin' six months just to pay the damn interest.
Ya still light seventy.
He only had a hundred an' thirty. -- I think he's good for the rest next week, Mr. Gazzo.
Tomorrow collect from Del Rio -- He's late three weeks. How'd you do last night?
Yo Rock. Did I give you a job this mornin? How come ya didn't break this guy's thumb like I asked ya? When ya don't do what ya are told, it makes me look bad, kid.
I figure if I break the thumb this guy gets thrown outta his job and can't pay nothin' no more.
Next Wednesday I grab a grand from Snyder. An' Thursday two yards from Cappoli, okay?
No, two yards from Snyder, an' a grand from Cappoli.
Ya sure?
Hey, screw ya brain on right. Now, who's this girl you're going out with tonight?
How'd you know?
You think I don't hear things?
Buddy's in a bad mood -- prostate problems.
Buddy's got a thing against ya, Rock. Some people just hate for no reason, y'know.
Yeah.
Here's fifty bucks -- You an' the girl have a nice time.
Y'know I won't be able to work for ya no more.
Hey -- if a good man can make a better life, let him make it.
I feel bad about walkin'.
Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses?
Here's five hundred -- Put it in your glove.
Does Santa Claus charge juice? Merry Christmas -- Now, how's about my present, ya gonna win?
Gonna try.
Listen, kid, I'm with ya. Ya know, I'm with ya -- Italian, we're blood. You kill this rug -- We Guinneas gotta show these Afro-Americans where it's at. Give it your best shot cause I want ya to prove to these bums on the corner that my man can't be beat by this rug... Ya got any action on the side.
No action.
Ya gettin 150 grand killer. Ya got any plans for it? Whatta ya think? Ya like to put it on the street, make it work for ya?
I'm gonna do somethin with it.
Sure, you do what ya want. Stay away from the stock market.
Black market?
Yo, you gonna show, Tony?
Hello, Mr. Balboa -- I'm Miles Jergens -- Please, have a seat.
...Thanks.
Mr. Balboa --
Rocky.
Rocky, do you have any representation? A manager?
No -- Just me.
Rocky, would you be interested in --
Sparrin'?
Excuse me.
I know ya need sparrin' partners -- I'm very available.
I'm sure you are.
Absolutely -- Sparrin' with the Champ would be an honor -- y'know what?
What?
Rocky, would you be interested in fighting Apollo Creed for the Championship?
...Like I said, I'd make a boss sparrin' mate.
Did you hear what I said?
Sure, an' I'm smart enough to know that no sparrin' partner should take cheap shots at the Champ. He's just there to help condition the man.
...Screw you.
What'd you say?
Did these guys teach you to talk dirty? Huh?
Hey --
What?
Stuff it, man!
How come ya wanna hang out with those guys? They teach ya bad things.
I like 'em. If you don't you can f --
Hey! When I was your age, there was only one girl who talked like that in the whole neighborhood.
Make your teeth yella --
I like yella teeth.
Makes your breath like garbage.
Nobody likes garbage -- Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin', but the guys wouldn't take her out for any serious datin'.
Why?
'Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty. They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word -- Whore. You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.
C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve.
That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it.
What?
Listen, I hope ya don't --
I won't.
What was I gonna say?
Ya hope I don't keep acting like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?
Goodnight, Rocky.
I don't care what nobody says, this bum Creed woulda never made it in the Thirties --
Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey?
...What?
I said, how ya feelin'?
Do you see me talkin'? Huh?
Yeah.
Then stand there an' wait till I'm done -- Creed's good, yeah, he's real fine but I gotta boy, y'know Big Dipper, who's got the stuff it takes to be a champ -- He's mean, quick, an' big -- What more d'ya need? Okay, go to work... Hey -- Yeah -- Whatta ya want?
I was talkin' with ya man, Mike. -- Hey, how come I been put outta my locker?
Dipper's a climber -- You're a tomato.
...Tomato?
How old are ya?
...What?
How old?
Come July, twenty-five.
More like thirty.
Twenty-five, thirty -- What's the difference? -- It took me two months to learn the combination of that locker.
The legs must be goin'.
Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... That was my locker for six years.
...Did ya fight last night?
Yeah --
Did ya win?
Yeah, Kayo.
...Who'd ya fight?
Spider Rice.
Rice is a bum.
You think everybody I fight is a bum.
Ya want the truth -- Ya got heart, but ya fight like an ape -- The only thing special about you is ya never got ya nose broke -- keep ya nose pretty -- what's left of ya brain an' retire.
Listen, I'm gonna take a steam -- Did good last night -- Shoulda seen it.
Hey, ever think about retirin'?
...No.
Think about it.
Did ya get the message, kid?
A Rep from Miles Jergens' Promotions was lookin' for ya -- They need sparrin' partners for Creed.
Ya puttin' me on?
Here's the card?
When was they here?
'Bout an hour ago.
Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.
I seen the light. I figure somebody was home.
Best seat in the house -- Hey, Mick, this is too much.
How do you mean?
Listen, Rock, you're a very lucky guy.
Yeah.
What's happened is freak luck.
Freak luck for sure.
Look at all them other fighters. Real good boys. Good records. Colorful. Fight their hearts out for peanuts -- But who cared? Nobody. They got it shoved in their back door. Nobody ever give them a shot at the title...
Whatta' those?
Turtles -- domestic turtles.
Fifty years, huh.
Fifty years. The rep is known around Philly, an' a good rep can't be bought, but I don't have to tell you that.
How 'bout a glass of water?
Rocky, d'ya know what I done?
...What?
I done it all. I've done an' seen everything'. Believe what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya shoulda seen the night in Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny' Russo outta the ring, September 14, 1923 -- same night Firpo knocked Dempsey outta the ring. But who got the Press? He did. He had a manager -- September 14, 1923.
Nobody ever said that -- There's his picture.
Really think so?
Ya got heart.
Respect, I always dished ya respect.
...Ya gave Dipper my locker.
I'm sorry, I -- I made a mistake. Kid, I'm askin' man to man. I wanna be ya manager.
The fight's set -- I don't need a manager.
Look, you can't buy what I know. Ya can't. I've seen it all! I got pain an' I got experience.
I got pain an' experience too.
Please, kid.
If ya was wantin' my help, why didn't ya ask? Just ask.
I asked, but ya never helped nothin'! -- Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance.
Tie it to both ankles -- Leave two feet slack.
What cha say, Benny -- Meet 'The Rock.' This is our cutman, Benny Stein.
Yo, Benny.
Don't you care what the people will say?
...I'm doin' it for a friend.
Whatta you get outta this?
I get the robe an' Paulie gets three grand.
Don't let 'im get you tight.
God bless ya, Rock.
How am I doin'?
Real good.
See how fast he is -- damn!
Ya nose is broke.
Damn! How's it look?
Can't hardly tell. Don't swallow the blood -- Go for his ribs. Don't let 'im breathe.
...The guy's great.
How you holdin' up, kid?
Fine... That guy's great.
Gimme the water! Ya gettin' tagged with his right. I think you should feint left and high hook 'im -- Benny, check the eyes! Can ya see?
Wanna keep goin'?
Would you keep goin'?
How I look out there, Mick?
I don't care what they say, you're a winner.
Yo, Mike -- What's happenin' here?
It ain't your locker no more.
Whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more?
You were ready to bite that guy's face.
Yeah -- See the fight last night? Apollo Creed beat that English guy bad.
Hey, Rock -- What happened?
Ya sappin' his strength -- He's losin' steam.
No more, ya wanna lose an eye? No more.
Startin' with the bad jokes early today, huh.
How's Butkus this mornin'?
...What kinda dog is this again?
Bullmastiff.
The owner was suppose to pick him up three weeks ago.
Yo, Paulie.
Yo, Rocky -- Look at this mirror. I'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror.
Yo, Paulie.
What?
Your sister's givin' me the shoulder.
Forget her. You could do better than my sister.
Every mornin', every night I pass by -- I smile. I say jokes. Nothin'. She looks at me.
Looks, huh?
Yeah, like I was a plate of leftovers -- Somethin' wrong with my face -- Whatta I need, a Caddy to connect with ya sister?
My sister's a friggin' loser.
Hey --
Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor.
Don't get mental, man.
Ya caught me in a bad mood.
Ya always in a bad mood --
She's a loser -- She don't enjoy life -- She reads -- Brainy -- Pushin' thirty friggin' years old! She's gonna die alone if she don't wise up.
I'm thirty myself.
An' you're dyin' alone, too.
I don't see no crowd around you, neither.
I wanna kill the friggin' moron who broke the mirror.
The girl's dryin' up! She's gotta live a little before her body dries up!! You're a pal, Rock -- How 'bout yo' talk to her? Y'know, it's Thanksgivin' tomorrow.
...Sure.
Tomorrow you come for some bird, right?
I usta be deadly at half-ball.
I hate the friggin' game... I'd like to talk some business.
What kinda business?
Inflamed joints -- Walkin' in an' out of a freezer carryin' meat plays hell on the joints.
Maybe ya should see a doctor.
I don't need a doctor, I need a different job.
Maybe another job is the best thing.
Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a friend an' would do a good job... Tell him I ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... Bustin' bones don't bother me -- Tell him I'm a good worker.
Gazzo's gotta come to you.
I'm askin' ya to go to him -- As a favor.
Ya sister knows I'm comin'?
!! Ya want the bird, go out in the alley an' eat the bird -- I want ya outta the house -- Enjoy ya friggin' life... Ya hungry, Rock?
Maybe ya better forget it.
...Maybe I better forget it.
What's ya sister like to do?
Ice skate.
Why?
Don't it matter none he's makin' ya out a fool? -- I'd break his lips.
It don't matter.
He's takin' cheap shots.
It don't bother me none.
Yo, Rock -- now ya'll be lookin' for people to help, right?
Help what?
Y'know, to help keep ya livin' clean.
I'll do okay.
Ya gotta have a guy help ya exercise, mebbe somebody to be standin' by with a towel or run errands, y'know.
Hey, who cared about me yesterday, huh? Nobody -- I think I'm gonna train myself.
How ya feelin'?
...Tight.
I got whiskey here.
If ya don't pay Gazzo, ya end up hangin' on the hook, right?
Gazzo's a good man.
How 'bout you talk to 'em about me? Please do me that favor.
Y'know, d'ya think you an' my sister -- Ah, doin' good together?
Whatta you think?
Ain't sure, what's the story?
What?
Ya really like her?
Sure I like her.
What's the attraction? I don't see it?
I dunno -- she fills gaps.
What gaps?
She got gaps. I got gaps -- together we fill the gaps.
You ballin' her?
Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister.
Yo, Rock. I made a few phone calls an' thanks to me ya goin' to be a big man -- Thatta dog?
Whatta these guys want?
To see ya train.
Yo, what's with you? -- It was suppose to be private.
Outta my house I want ya!!
...I can't haul meat no more.
What can I do about it?
Christ, I been beggin' ya for a break until I'm sick inside.
So much has happened lately -- Has it changed your life style much?
...People talk to me more.
We can cut that out later. Apollo Creed says he'll let you stay three rounds before he puts you away.
Apollo's a great fighter.
Do you feel you have a chance?
I'll tear his head off.
Do you have anything derogatory to say about the Champion?
This is your largest payday ever -- How do you feel about it?
Feel? I dunno... Happy.
How will you fight Apollo Creed?
Is it true the most you've ever made in a prizefight is five hundred dollars?
Four hundred -- But that was a long time ago.
And now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Any comment?
We don't serve formula. Snookums.
You serve martinis, doncha?
Oh, a ladies man, huh?
No. But neither does Roger. That's Diablo Red. Roger's pants are Sunrise Orange.
Well, I'll be...
Make it dry. Baby doesn't like to be wet. You're Valiant, right? The name's Baby Herman.
I know who you are. Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
Yeah, I had to go slummin'. See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
You mean the rabbit? They got him cold.
My problem is I come here to drink in peace. So if you don't mind...
And another thing, the paper said no will was found. But every Toon knows Acme had a will and, in it he promised to leave Toontown to the Toons.
So where is it then?
My hunch is it was Maroon. He always was after Acme's property.
Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie. We miss you in Toontown.
Wish I could say the same. What're you doin' here, Betty?
Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color. But I still got it, Eddie... 'Boop boop be-doop'.
Yeah, you still got it, Betty. Who's Mr. Jocularity?
That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
Shoulda guessed.
He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
Big on the musical comedy, huh?
What's this, Roger?
A tweeting bird?
Please, Raoul. I can give you stars, I know I can. Just drop the safe on my head one more time.
I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
Don't worry about me. I can take it.
So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie? Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a <u>dame</u> who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump. And it was a <u>dame</u> who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would. And it's a <u>dame</u> who's tired of waitin' for you to straighten
This is fifty bucks. I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.
You'll have it in the morning. Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
Is this paper even good?
Check the scrawl.
Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.
A new outfit bought the Red Car. Some big company called Cloverleaf Industries.
No kiddin'? Bought the Red Cars, huh?
Do you think the rabbit did it?
Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages.
The papers said the safe door was opened, Eddie.
So you're not even gonna bother to find out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?
Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it is?
He's a riot.
Oh, yeah? Well, you're not handcuffed to him. Anybody in the back room?
So you decided to help him after all?
Can you get him out of it, Eddie?
So what's the scam, Eddie?
Maybe they just took it out of his pocket.
Eddie, you still got it. Hey, tomorrow maybe I'll go down to probate court and see who's sniffin' around Acme's estate?
What was <u>that</u>?
<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
The rabbit's wife? Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.
Maroon, right?
Nope. It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
What's that comin' from the bar?
Sounds like singin'.
I was hopin' you'd be there. Maroon's called here about four times. He says he's gotta talk to you tonight. He says he can help you.
I'll bet.
Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
What've I got to lose? You okay, Dolores?
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
That'll work out just fine. When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina. How does that sound?
He's not my client. I was workin' for R.K. Maroon.
Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon. He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back. Is that true?
Men? They look more like weasles to me.
Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift for the work. The rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?
Why would he contact me? I just took some lousy pictures.
So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective. What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant?
Marvin Acme had no will. I should know, the probate is in my court.
They must've taken it off me.
They?
Take it easy, Bongo. We'll handle Mr. Valiant our own way... downtown.
Downtown? Fine. Get a hold of Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk to him.
You're not takin' me to downtown <u>Toon</u>town?
Indeed we are. We'll continue the interrogation there.
I ain't tellin' you nothin'! Get me Santino.
I don't think it's gonna matter. Sorry, pal, I tried.
Well, why not? I'm feeling magnanimous tonight. The successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist. I'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector.
These roads can be very treacherous at night, especially in a maniacal Toon vehicle.
The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.
No matter. I don't expect the will to show up in the next fifteen minutes. By then Cloverleaf will own Toontown quite legally.
So you're Cloverleaf?
Come on, Doom. What would a company like that want with Toontown?
Don't you think anyone's gonna notice that Toontown's gone?
Right here where we're standing, will be the cornerstone of my idea... the cloverleaf -- an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways.
What the hell's a freeway?
A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena. Pasadena to Hollywood. Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another.
That's what this is all about? Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.
Holy shit, he's a Toon!
Surprised?
You?
Here's one for the books... a Toon wearin' human clothes.
Earl... it's me, Valiant.
Eddie? Jesus, what happened?
Toon cops worked me over.
Boy, I'll say. They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo.
You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.
No...
Does it hurt?
Not much. It's hard to talk.
Last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir. Maybe that's what he was after?
Hello, Mr. Valiant. I rang the doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear it.
Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.
Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?
Toons aren't given imperfections.
No? I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger. Can you help me find him? I'll pay you anything.
Yeah, I'll bet you would. You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
No, no, no... I love my husband.
Oh, sure. I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.
Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant. You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
So altruistic.
It's the truth. Why won't you believe it?
Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills. I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.
You shot Roger.
Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.
It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?
Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't know who I could trust.
We're even. By the way, I did find your husband.
Where is he?
How did you get onto Doom?
So where is it?
When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.
Looks like our goose is cooked, our hash is slung, our fait is accompli...
Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?
Hold on a second.
Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for a Toon named Roger the Rabbit.
Now what?
They say the rabbit got the safe idea from a cartoon he was makin' the other day.
What a gasser.
Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?
What's with the dip?
What the hell is that?
Doom.
Valiant, did you see the rabbit?
He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?
How much do you know about show business, Valiant?
Yeah, and there's no business as expensive. I'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest Bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. And you know why?
One too many safes dropped on his head?
Here's the problem... "Seen cooing over calamari with notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger". His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's Betty Crocker. The doubt's eatin' him up.
So what do you want me to do?
Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
I don't work in Toontown.
You don't have to. The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club. You can catch her in action there.
The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks.
A hundred bucks? That's ridiculous.
I got him on loan from Disney.
When will I hear from you?
Well, you better start thinkin' about drinkin' it black.
Son-of-a-bitch... Mr. Maroon, I think I'll be goin' now, so about the rest of my fee...
Hi, Mr. Maroon. Remember me?
Valiant? What're you doin' here?
I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
I've already seen your photographs.
Maroon? Whaddaya want?
Have you got the will?
Maybe. Why?
Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.
Valiant! You surprised me.
You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?
No... I'm not. I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
Well, everybody needs a hobby.
You got the will in there, don't ya?
No, I don't.
You tricked me, damn you!
Take it easy.
Pattycake! Pattycake!
My advice? Hop on over to Reno, get yourself a quickie divorce.
Aah!
What the hell are you doin'?
I needed a place to hide. I'm in trouble, Eddie.
So I hear. Even talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.
Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.
Oh, yeah? Then how'd you find my house?
Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner. He didn't know. Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way. He was very helpful.
Look, pal, if you're still here when I finish this drink, I'm callin' the police.
Don't do that! I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me. They were waitin' for me when I got home last night. I ran.
If you're so innocent, why'd you run?
Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding...
Hey! What do you think you're doin'?
Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a Toon.
Does this help?
You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?
Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?
My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.
Yeah. I think Maroon plays the part of the sound mind, your wife the sound body.
I resent that innuendo! My wife is completely innocent.
The habeus corpus is thickening.
Yeah. Except they screwed up. I don't think they got the will.
How do you know that?
Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective, your logic is specious. What prevented Mr. Acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him?
Hey, don't I get an encore?
Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you. I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.
But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre. Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops. That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
Angelo? He's a pal, a chum...
An arsonist and a kidnapper. He just got outta prison.
Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
Just because you got 'em to laugh?
A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.
I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety.
I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time. But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!
Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?
A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.
Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me.
But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'. Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the noodle, the grey matter...
Valiant and Valiant? Who's the other Valiant?
So what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi?
Say, who's this guy laughin'?
Me.
Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before. That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?
You damn Toon! No wonder they picked you for the patsy. Always gotta play the fool. You make me sick!
Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?
You wanna know? Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya. One of you Toons killed my brother.
A Toon? Noooo.
Yeah, a Toon. It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother.
Him? Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.
Yeah, everybody thought so. But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons. All Toons. We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case. But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all. We went to his house to take
Safe?
I'll get it.
Wrong number?
Gee, Eddie, you're not gonna go, are ya? Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine o'clock.
That's why I'll be there at 8:45.
I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.
You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think.
How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
Two bits.
If I don't make it back here by ten...
Yeah?
What the hell are you doin' in there?
Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over.
That's not blood. That's ink. That goof Acme squirted me with some the other day. Why it's comin' 'through now, I don't know.
That's because it's Disappearing-Reappearing Ink. Shows up three days later. Gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn't punch you in the nose. Great gag.
Say Roger, remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint Club?
Yeah?
I think you oughta read it to her.
Keep reading...
No, kid, you're a real hero.
By the way, Roger, you were right about your wife. She's a good lady. I'm glad you got her back.
And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back. Think you'll keep it?
Pretty good cigar. Where'd you get it?
Boo! Ah, ha ha. Ooh. Boo! Ha ha ha.
I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
I do bite my thumb, sir!
Do you bite your thumb at us? Sir.
Quarrel sir! no, sir.
If you do, sir, I am for you. I serve as good a man as you.
No better?
If she is well then nothing can be ill. Her body rests in Capel's monument, and her immortal part with the angel's lives. I saw her laid low. Pardon me for bringing these ill news.
Then I defy you, stars! JULIET! JULIET! I will hence tonight.
Have patience!
Leave Me!
Your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure.
Live and be prosperous; and farewell good fellow.
Then I'll leave thee.
Romeo! Romeo!
Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home to-night?
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
Why that pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline. Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet, Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
A challenge, on my life.
Romeo will answer it?
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.
But alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
Why, what is Tybalt?
More than prince of cats. He is the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing prick- song, keeps time, distance, and proportion; he rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause: the immortal passado!
Keep away the cats! Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says, &quot;God send me no need of thee.&quot; and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
Am I like Such a fellow?
Thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Verona.
By my head here come the Capulets.
Either withdraw unto some private place, or reason coldly of your grievences, or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.
Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate, O anything of nothing first create. heavy lightness. Serious vanity. Misshapen chaos of well seeming forms.
Good-morrow, cousin.
Is the day so young?
But new struck cuz.
Ay me! Sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
In love?
Out--
Of love?
Out of her favour, where I am in love.
Alas, that love, so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still, Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will! Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here? Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. Here's much to do with hate, but more with love. Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate! O any thing, of nothing first create! O heavy lightness!
No, cuz, I rather weep.
Good heart, at what?
At thy good heart's oppression.
Farewell, my cuz.
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
A right good marks-man! And she's fair I love.
A right fair mark, fair cuz, is soonest hit.
Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit With Cupid's arrow; Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes, Nor open her lap to saint-seducing gold:
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
Teach me how I should forget to think.
By giving liberty unto thine eyes; Examine other beauties. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
Every man betake him to his legs.
This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves; Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio.
What dares the slave Come hither, To fleer and scorn at our solemnity? Now, by the stock and honour of my kin, To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.
Young Romeo is it?
'Tis he.
Content thee, gentle cuz, content thee. Let him alone; I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement: Therefore be patient, take no note of him
I'll not endure him.
He shall be endured
Uncle, 'tis a shame.
Such mortal drugs I have, but Verona's law is death to any that utters them.
The world is not thy friend, nor the worlds law. Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
My poverty, but not my will consents.
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
Drink it off and, if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight.
Are you at leisure Holy Father, now? Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
It strains me past the compass of my wits.
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I'll help it presently!
Hold Daughter!
Be not so long to speak I long to die.
I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate and execution as that is desperate which we would prevent. If, rather than to marry Paris, Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Then it is likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death, to chide away this shame. No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest . Each part, deprived
Good marrow, father!
Young son, it argues a distemper'd head so soon to bid good marrow to thy bed: or if not so so, then here I hit it right, our Romeo hath not seen his bed tonight.
The last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
God pardon sin, was thou with Rosaline!?
Rosaline? My ghostly father no; I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
That's my good son: but where hast thou been
I have been feasting with mine enemy, where on a sudden one hath wounded me, that's by me wounded; both our remeidies within thy help and holy physic lies.
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift; riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
Then plainly know my hearts dear love is set, on the fair daughter of rich Capulet. We met, we wooed, we made exchange of vow. I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, that thou consent to marry us today.
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes.
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
For doting; not for loving, pupil mine.
I pray thee, chde me not; whom I love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow; the other did not so.
O, she new well. Thy love read by rote and could not spell. Come, young waverer, come, go with me, In one respect I'll thy assistant be; for this alliance may so happy prove, to turn you household rachor to pure love.
O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
Banishment? Be merciful, say death; for exile hath more terror in his look much more than death. Do not say Banishment.
Affliction is enamoured of thy parts, and thou art wedded to calamity. Hence from Verona art thou banished. Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
There is no world without Verona walls, hence banished is banished from the world and worlds exile is death. Then banished is death mis-termed. Calling death banished, thou cu'st my head off with a golden axe and smiles upon the stroke that murders me.
How well my comfort is revived by this.
Hie you make haste! But look thou stay not till the watch be set, for then thou canst not pass to Mantua where thau shalt live till we can find a time to blaze you marriage, reconcile your friends, beg pardon of the Prince and call thee back with twenty hundred times more joy, than thou wentst forth in lamentation. Quick hence! Be gone
As the custom is, in all her best array, bear her to church.
Juliet!
I come for my lady Juliet.
Welcome.
Where is my Lady's lord?
I thought thy disposition better tempered! Thy Juliet is alive. There art thou happy. The law that threatened death becomes thy friend and turns it to exile. There art thou happy. A Pack of blessings light upon thy back. Wherefore railest thou on thy birth the heaven and earth? Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet in thee at once.
O God. Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood? O serpent heart hid with a flowering face. Was ever book containing such vile matter's so fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace.
Thou hast a careful father, child: One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects nor I looked not for.
Madam, in happy time what day is that?
Marry my child next Thursday Morn. The gallant, young and noble gentleman, Sir Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, shall make thee there a joyful bride.
What? Now. St. Peter's Church, and Peter too, he shall not make me there a joyful bride!
O sweet my mother cast me not away. Delay this marriage for a month, a week. Or if you do not make the bridal bed in that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
Talk not to me, for Ill not speak a word. Do as thou wilt for I have done with thee.
What, daughter are you busy? Need you my help?
No, madam. We have culled such necessaries as our behoveful for our state tomorrow. so please you, let me now be left alone, and let the nurse this night sit up with you. for I am sure you have your hands full in all this so sudden business.
Geth thee to be and rest, for thou has need.
Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again.
Goodnight.
I bade her come. God forbid! Juliet! Juliet! Juliet!
Juliet!
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
[Within] Juliet!
I uh, by and by I come--But if thou mean'st not well, I do beseech thee--
[Within] Juliet!
O honey nurse, what news? Nurse?
I am a-weary, give me leave awhile: Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I!
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news: I pray thee, speak.
What haste? can you not stay awhile? Do you not see that I am out of breath?
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad? answer to that;
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
But all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that?
Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! O, my back! Other' other side,--O, my back.
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
Where is my mother! How oddly thou repliest! Your love says, like an honest gentleman, Where is your mother?'
O lady dear! Are you so hot? Henceforward do your messages yourself.
Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
Have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
I have.
Faith, here it is. I think it best you marry with this Paris. O, he's a lovely gentleman. I think you are happy in this second match, for it excels your first; or if it did not, your first is dead--or 'twere as good he were as living here and you no use to him.
Speakest thou from thy heart?
And from my soul too. Else beshrew them both.
Amen
What?
Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight! For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
If I profane with my unworthiest hand This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this: My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Well, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take. Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.
He jests at scars that never felt a wound. But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, Who is already sick and pale with grief, That thou her maid art far more fair than she: Be not her maid, since she is envious; Her vestal livery is
Ay me!
She speaks: O, speak again, bright angel!
Romeo, O Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
[Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy; Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot, Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! What's in a name? that which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet; So Romeo would, were he not
I take thee at thy word.
Ahhh!
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? The garden walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls; For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do that dares love attempt; Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes, And but thou love me, let them find me here: My life were better ended by their hate, Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny What I have spoke: but farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,' And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st, Thou
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb, Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
Well what shall I swear by?
Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee.
If my heart's dear love--
Do not swear: although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to-night: It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night! This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night.
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
So thrive my soul--
A thousand times good night! Exit, above
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
Romeo! At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee?
By the hour of nine.
Come gentle night. Come loving black-browned night give me my Romeo. And when I shall die, take him and cut him out into little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun. O, I have bought the mansion of love but not possessed,
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
That light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to Mantua. Therefore stay yet. Thou needest not be gone.
Let me be taken, let me be put to death. I have more care to stay then will to go. Come death, Welcome, Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let us talk it is not day.
It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away. O, now be gone. More light and light it grows.
Then window, let day in and let life out. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
I doubt it not. Trust me, love, all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come. Adieu.
Romeo. What's here? Poison. Drunk all, and left no friendly drop to help me after. I will kiss thy lips. Happily some poison yet doth hang on them. Thy lips are warm.
Nurse, give leave awhile, We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again; I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel. Nurse, Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.
By my count, I was your mother much upon these years, You are now a maid. Thus then in brief: The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
A man, young lady! Lady, such a man As all the world- -why, he's a man of wax.
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face, And find delight writ there with beauty's pen; This precious book of love, this unbound lover, To beautify him, only lacks a cover: So shall you share all that he doth possess, By having him, making yourself no less.
Nay, bigger; women grow by men.
Go! We follow thee. Juliet, Blah!
Young hearts run free. Never be caught up, caught up like Rosaline and thee. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
Not I, Not I believe me: you have dancing shoes With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings, And soar with them above a common bound.
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
Why, may one ask?
I dream'd a dream to-night.
And so did I.
Well, what was yours?
That dreamers often lie.
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you. She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate-stone On the fore-finger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies Over men's noses as they lie asleep; Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat, And in this state she gallops night
Peace, good Mercutio, peace! Thou talk'st of nothing.
Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
Ho Ho, Capital Punks!
Signior Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
The slip, son, the slip; can you not conceive?
Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.
Meaning, to court'sy.
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
A most courteous exposition.
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
Pink for flower.
Right.
Why, then is my pump well flowered.
Sure Witt! Now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature.
I will follow you.
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Ay, a scratch, a scratch. HA HA HA.
Courage man, the hurt can not be much.
'Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man. A plague o' both your houses. They have made worms meat of me. A plague on both your Houses! Why the devil did you come between us? I was hurt under your arm.
I thought all for the best.
A Plague o' both your houses.
Follow me close. Gentlemen, gooday. A word with one of you?
OH, and but one word with one of us? Couple it with something. Make it a word and a...a blow.
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir. And you will give me occasion.
Could you not take some occasion without giving?
Mercutio! Thou art consortest with Romeo?
Calm, Dishonorable, Vile Submission! Thou art my souls hate! Tybalt! You ratcatcher, will you walk?
What wouldst thou have with me?
Good king of cat's, nothing but one of your nine lives.
Madam, your mother craves a word with you. Come lets away.
Is she a Capulet?
If ye should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say: for the lady is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing, and very weak dealing.
Nurse.
O, she says nothing sir, but weeps and weeps, and then on Romeo cries and then falls down again.
Do you have it?
Always in a rush, you are. All these years I've known you, you could never wait for anything.
This is important.
Do you really think so?
Why did you do that?
It's under your seat.
What?
Coordinate all you want, but make sure whatever you do gets cleared through me. Are we in sync on this, Vincent?
We kept it...
While Sam and I take out the back two cars...
And then Sam, you and I clean up whatever's left to be cleaned.
Of course.
Finding this package is a thing easier said than done. We don't even know what it is. What did we steal?
I don't know.
When this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show. And I don't believe you'd be running this show if you didn't know what was going on.
Well I don't!
You go shoot me if you want, Vincent, but you'll be dead before I hit the ground.
Only the stupid ones. Cigarettes kill more patriots than bullets. Besides, I'm not IRA no more.
So where do you go from here?
I don't know. I was thinking...Maybe the three of us might partner up -- guns for hire, that sort of thing.
It's good to see you've all got such faith in our little undertaking.
Who the fuck are you?
I drive -- and my name is Larry. Larry from the States.
So what's the deal?
You call me with the target's route, I follow along until we've reached the attack point and then I run his squag ass off the road.
Then Swede and I split with the package and meet you back at the rendezvous.
And you believed me? But it wasn't my people who did it.
I never did trust that blonde fuck...
This...this is incredible. Is the rest of Europe like this?
Some places, not all. Italy, for instance, they're serious about their food. But try bloody Britain, anywhere in the U.K., you don't get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg. Food's not our thing, you see.
What is?
Best beer in the world known to man or God.
Best beer in the world? Budweiser for me, thanks.
Budweiser? You talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention Budweiser in the same sentence? That's not beer! Christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss.
Oh yeah? Whatta you drink, then?
When we're done with this, I want to do for that one myself.
Now there's the Deirdre I know.
And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?
It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you. You've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun, I might note. There's no glory to it, but there are those that like it.
So you thought that maybe I'd grown too attached to this charade I've been playing, is that it?
It's been known to happen.
Not to me, you know that.
Problem my ass! I think you're lying to me, and if you are you're a dead man!
Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there?
What in bloody hell is going on?
They're part of the team. One of them's the guy I told you about.
From Interpol?
Lose them!
About time!
Good Christ! Can't you lose these jokers?
You better be careful, Seamus, before something happens a plastic surgeon can't fix.
Plastic fucking surgeon? You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre lass? It's the mark of the patriot, and I'll wear it like a badge. As for those who done it to me, I'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over.
You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head...
Do I need to repeat myself?
Sam. I'm a weapons guy.
You were a soldier, were you?
Hazard pay...
The two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war...
I feel as if I've wandered onto the set of Enter The Dragon. Could you teach me to do that?
I didn't think to see you again tonight. You were pretty pissed.
I still am.
Is that right?
Part of me says I should just look at this as a perk. You know, a bonus. But then I remember you're you -- Deirdre who used to belong to the IRA -- and it occurs to me that deceit and subterfuge come very naturally to you.
Nobody's saying they don't.
And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
Look, Sam, don't take it the wrong way when I tell you we won't be doing this again.
You don't have to explain yourself to me, Deirdre.
I know I don't have to, Sam, it's just that, for once, I want to. when I was a - Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with. You know: any man who needed setting up. Sometimes so we might blackmail him, sometimes so he could be killed. Sometimes so I could kill
You're a hired gun, Deirdre -- just like me.
I better be getting that.
Duty calls?
Now, what did we steal?
Because if they had she'd be gone along with the package, instead of sitting here with us.
I bought it for him -- all the stuff he was using, it was in his contract. Cost a nice penny, too, especially that goddamned phone: Gregor had expensive tastes.
Check this out. Gregor's a spook, or he was one until recently. When he was a spy he lived the life -- you know, a prince in some Eastern Bloc country where nobody had shit and Gregor had everything. Then the wall goes down. No more Cold War. And Gregor is out of a job. No apartment, no special stores with Western food and
Well, if it isn't Mr. Interpol himself. I can't believe I misjudged you like I did.
Oh please..you're on some sort of holy mission?
I'm a patriate.
Don't even think that I'm buying that.
Where do you get off saying word one? All the time pretending to be one of us, it's the same thing we were doing, Seamus and myself. And here you are so high and mighty, like you're so different from the rest of us.
I didn't say I was.
Are you alright?
Not me. You work too often with the same people and you become friends -- clouds your judgement.
Who are you? IRA?
From here on in you want something you pay cash for it: no credit cards, no bank accounts are in place: ten percent up front, the rest when the job is done. You. What do you do and what should we call you?
It's quite satifactory.
Good, because it cost enough. There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
I intend to. This phone is wired like no other: it's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition, it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand. With my custom hardware and this phone I can trace the target's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes...
You sure about this?
I'd stake my reputation.
But would you stake your life, that's the question...
Now then, let's run through it one more time, shall we? What's your job?
I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target. I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you.
Alright, Gregor, I'm...
Where's the case?
That fucking figures...
Go ahead, shoot... Shoot and kill the bitch, I don't care. And yet you don't shoot. Interesting. Put down your weapon and walk away.
Don't do it, Sam!
Shut up!
Yes, Gregor, they sent me.
I'm touched, really, that they'd send someone of your caliber. It's nice to know that they didn't make the mistake of underestimating me twice.
That was a mistake, trying to kill you. Mikhi did it without consulting me, I'd have never allowed it.
I'm sure. But I'm sorry to say that it's too late for trust: we have a serious problem.
We'll double your price.
Really? Do you have the money with you?
Do you have the material?
You first, Edvard.
Perhaps we could both go at the same time...
Do you have it?
Not so fast. Who's that?
He's company.
Bad company...
What do you mean?
Here's yours.
There's been a slight problem.
If you say a word in English, Vincent, my friend with the high powered sporting rifle will shoot you in the throat. Sorry to screw you over like this, but the information you want might get me killed if I give it to you, and that's a price I'm not willing to pay.
I take it you still want the money...
Where's my information?
In here...
Sit, sit... Would you like one?
No, Mikhi, I wouldn't. Since I won't speak your language, and you can't speak mine, English will do nicely.
Whatever you wish... This has all been a terrible mistake, Gregor. I wanted to play straight with you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill you.
Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.
I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him.
And more importantly --
We'll die if we stay here!
If you're lying to me you poor excuse for a human being, I'm gonna blow your brains all over this car.
This better be the real thing or you're a dead man!
It is, I'm telling you it is!!
What am I doing here? Why, I'm here to see my partners, Gregor, the boys in the Russian Mafia. See, your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross. But they only just found out that what's in the briefcase is completely useless without me. I can't fight them, and they can't kill me -- that means
But you hate each other!
So, you've got it all figured, do you?
Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him.
Whoever hired us.
So none of us knows who's paying the freight, this is just some anonymous job. For all we know, we're working for different people.
Don't talk to me unless you tell me what I want to hear, understand?!? You have no choice in this, don't think about winning, think about staying alive. I want the item, and if you don't give it to me, I'm gonna kill you.
I don't have it with me...
Bullshit!
I swear...
Then where is it?
I sent it to myself in Paris.
Sent it where?
Is it done?
Gregor, is that you?
Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.
I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me!
So what do we do?
How so?
I would imagine that the great satisfaction in all of this will be killing the American.
I hadn't thought about it. Understand me, Gregor -- I take no pleasure in killing. It doesn't bother me one bit, but I don't get off on it.
A means to an end, is that it?
That's it.
Then I guess we're set.
There is one other thing...
What are you doing?
Don't cross me...
Nobody's going to do that!
Really?
I need you, Swede, I can't do this without you!
I just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with.
Hello, Jean-Pierre.
He's tough, your American friend.
Yes, Sam's tough alright.
And you respect him.
Of course. Don't you?
I've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through. He's a cop?
Not exactly.
Not exactly? But close enough, eh? So he saved your life, then?
How did you know?
American.
Are you sure you won't have a drink?
You think you can stitch me up on you own?
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
Some, thanks. Enough to move on, for now.
You should really let a doctor look at that.
Soon.
But first you have something to take care of?
Yeah.
Something important? A thing that cannot wait?
It gets done now or not at all. Another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where I can't get them.
He sees this differently, as you well know.
I didn't expect that he would.
You suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law.
Vincent told you that I'm a cop?
So this is what, a test?
If I was healthy, I could take that away from you.
So what is it you want to know?
I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.
Created?
Perhaps forged is a better word. Like steel. Like a sword. You're a modern Samurai. I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you. I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.
Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll have to carry it for himself. And I'm not any kind of Samurai.
You seem one to me.
The point remains: we could be working for different people. There's a chance for one of us... Maybe more than one of us -- has been paid to cross the others. I don't know about you guys, but I like to know who I'm working for. It can help prevent a great deal of... ...unpleasantness.
You shoot alright.
Gets the job done.
All in the stomach, though. Your man might live.
Not for long.
Long enough to shoot back.
Is that right?
It's been known to happen.
Yeah, well... My way works too.
It's a cocktail. Mostly demerol, cut with a little crank because we might need you awake in the real near future.
What are you gonna do, call him up and ask him to give us back our shit?
What're you talking about, man? I don't understand.
What a surprise...
They call me Swede.
Who's they?
You should watch what you eat.
Who the fuck died and appointed you food czar?
I'm just worried about your health, Larry. You could stand to shed a few pounds.
And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?
I ride with fat-boy...
Eat shit and die slowly...
After we stop the target car I get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard.
Where is this broad?
You should learn a little patience.
Is that right?
It's consider a virtue in some corners of the world.
I don't particularly like killing, tubby, but I want you to know that this one I'm going to enjoy.
Sorry I'm late...
What makes you think we're here to meet you?
Perhaps the police?
Cigarette?
He trusts you to lock up?
I'm Vincent. And I coordinate.
Coordinate what?
Where to?
To see a man about a thing.
Pretty much what you'd expect.
He says this is their block.
As in, they own it?
Something like that...
And I suppose he's saying that we oughta give them something for using it, huh?
I didn't know that you spoke French.
What'd you say to him?
That was a nice move you did on our young friend. Judo?
Jujitsu.
Same thing, isn't it?
Not at all. Similar, but not the same.
What's the difference?
Help yourself. Since when do you smoke?
I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.
A cigarette? As in one? One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
I do.
Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day, and I tell myself I could be worse. It's just so damned pleasurable.
It has it's moments. Course, you get cancer and die, that's the down side.
So, Vincent: why bring me along for the ride? Job like this calls for a warm body, somebody who can stand around and look threatening. A tough guy.
Like Larry or Swede.
Exactly. Why not bring them?
Let's just say I thought the conversational possibilities were limited. Of course, I might have brought Gregor, but he didn't seem like the right candidate -- for this.
Watch that one, he's an ex-spook for sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB. He's smart, Gregor is.
So is the woman.
Deirdre? Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.
I wonder if she truly left the IRA.
I've wondered that myself. None of this answers my question, though... Why bring me?
I wanted to see who you were.
You were once some kind of special forces. Airborne Ranger, maybe a Navy SEAL. After that you rode shotgun for the CIA in some place like El Salvador or Afghanistan, a real mercenary. Only now -- now you're like the rest of us, it's a very competitive market since the end of the cold war. There's a lot of hired guns out here, and
That's right: there's not hardly enough work these days, nothing that pays the big money, anyhow. Then along comes this job, paying so much goddamned money I couldn't afford not to take it. Somebody's paying through the nose for this.
They certainly are. Whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something.
Lovely, isn't it?
What's going on?
I just wanted to see something.
I needed to know.
You know, what you pulled back there, that was bullshit.
I needed to see if you were a cop. I'm a popular man with the police, Sam, and whenever they try to catch me they always do it with an inside guy -- some man on some job who seems more trustworthy than all the others put together. And that's the guy you have to watch out for. I hate cops...
How did you know?
Know what?
That there was a gun pointed at me.
I saw you look off when Francois nodded his head. I figured he wasn't pointing out a particularly rare shrub, and the rest was easy.
But how did you know I would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when I did?
The question still remains: what do we do now?
What's going on?
I came up here to sneak a smoke.
You were smoking?
I hope you don't mind I took your pack. It was on the table.
I borrowed that, too...
Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
It was at that.
A lot of people died.
I've seen a lot of people die before.
I haven't. Not like that. How do you get used to it?
You don't. You just learn to live with it.
I won't lie -- there have been times when I had to do it, times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didn't.
We live in a singular world, my friend.
I never really thought I was part of the world you move in, Sam, to tell you the truth. I'm a hood, a thief. Big time in a small time king of way. To the local police I'm a prize, to the local hoods I'm a legend. But to a guy like you I'm just another two bit hired gun.
He's going back.
Not necessarily. He could go off road at any number of places. He might not even be in the country anymore.
You're a cop...you're a fucking cop...I should kill you.
That makes twice now you've saved my life.
I didn't save your life back there. Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save shit.
You see it your way, I'll see it mine. You need a doctor.
You know one around here? Somebody you trust?
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
No hospitals. I'll fix this myself if I have to.
Fix it yourself? Why are we even doing this? There's no need to run, Christ... You're a cop.
Not exactly.
You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.
If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have busted you a long time ago. This isn't about you, it's about the job I have to do.
And what job is that?
It looks to me like we're all that's left of our group.
We? There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
I'm going with you.
This doesn't involve you, don't you understand? I can't even guarantee you any money out of all this.
It isn't about money for me, not anymore.
You don't have to do this.
Alright, it's done.
You see the bullet?
Clearly.
You know him?
The Irish representative?
What's this?
The address of the Russian production company. Just in case we need to find them.
You sure your friend got the right place?
Tell me, Sam: why do you do this?
Do what?
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
It's my job.
Then quit. You don't work for Interpol, Sam.
Sure I do. You heard him, you heard the guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard said.
I'm a field agent -- last of an already extinct breed. I do dark ops.
Dark ops?
Dark operations. Wet work. Kidnaping. Assassination.
Very ugly.
It is at that.
Not very zen of you, huh? Not so much the modern Samurai after all.
I never made that claim.
I know. Jean-Pierre did.
You were behind the door?
I was waiting to see what would happen. I didn't want to kill him if I didn't have to.
You would have done that?
I would have tried not to. But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have.
How could you have done that?
They don't have the package.
You think?
What the fuck happened?
I don't know...
Give me a cigarette.
Right now?
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
I'm not here very much.
Business keeps you on the road?
I know I don't need to say this to you, but I need to say it to you. This is my job, I have to do it.
So I do it.
No you don't, and you know it.
If our positions were reversed, would you leave me?
In a minute.
Do we need anything else?
Not here. They might see it.
Time to quit.
Just like that?
Not just like that... Just before I turn around and it's six months from now and the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is light a cigarette.
What of it? Samurai pain in the ass.
Would you stop with that...
Why? You've got more force of will than anyone I've ever seen. You handle a gun like it's a part of you, you perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia... And most amazing of all, you quit smoking, just like that.
The mark of a true Samurai. What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no different than what you do. We're both hired guns, and this is a job -- like any other job.
Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other? Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.
Because I don't walk away.
Why not?
It's the one thing I've got left to hold onto. Jean-Pierre is one of your closest friends, is he not?
Closest and oldest.
And yet you would have killed him to save my life. You have a sense of honor, Vincent, that I can't even remember anymore. I don't know that I ever even had it to begin with. All I know to do, Vincent, is to finish my job.
And when you finish? What then? This package, whatever it is, do you give it to the CIA? Do you really think they deserve it?
That's a good question.
Do you have a good answer?
You have to stop doing that!
Let's get him out of here...
Finish the job...
And now...
You son-of-a-bitch...
What?
You speak French.
What of it?
"Your field dressing saved his life." That's three I owe you.
You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it. You stepped in front of a bullet for me. I owe you a heavy debt.
I know.
You better get some sleep, alright?
Tell me something first. The package: what was it?
I don't know. Nobody knows, except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us. There's probably a couple of guys back at the Company who know, but I don't think they plan to tell me anytime soon.
What happened to it?
Gone. Destroyed.
I told you, I quit.
What's the story?
Gaelic.
You sure?
Why's that?
Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find.
It's the Irish tape we want.
Last I heard there was a film rep for the Irish players staying at this address, name of Seamus Reilly.
Why didn't you kill her?
You slept with her!
You slept with her!
You should have kill him when you had the chance. But no...
You put everything on the line because you...
My man, how you doing?
I'm alright. And you?
Doing well. This is?
A friend. I was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes.
I was wondering if you had any movies that were particularly new.
Do you have the tape?
What I've heard so far, it's all a lot of talk. I wasn't so sure what to make of it at first, cause, like I said, the Irish and the Russians are an unlikely mix.
You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
Can you get it?
Seamus Reilly, boy's a serious Irish Auteur -- a real firebrand. Thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peace-loving pussies, if you see what I'm saying.
Tony and I have to talk some business, first.
I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.
Sort of!
What the hell happened here?
I'd like to know what they were doing in my town! Did you get ID off any of them?
Damn.
Whatsamatter with you? Aren't you concerned about all of this?
I should kill you right here! I never thought you'd do this to me but I guess there's a lot I didn't know about you!
Dwayne listen to me -
Shut up! Not another word out of you! You're going down, the Feds know all about it! You didn't know some of it was marked, did you! Where's the rest?
I don't know what you're -
Ready to roll, partner?
Don't spend it all in one place.
How old is Otis anyhow, thirty?
Thanks for the loan, man. I'll have it in a few days, I promise.
Well I hope so. That pretty much cleaned me out.
I would have asked my sister, but its better to leave family out, always leads to trouble.
Yeah...I remember my brother-in-law Gary, the wheel watcher. He finally got on the show and won seven thousand dollars! Plus some leather furniture. Do you think I saw any of that? His excuse was the government got it all.
Seven thousand...
He would have won more but he blew it at the end. Didn't know what Cash and Carry was.
Cash and what?
Cash and Carry, you know, FDR, World War two...
Never heard of it.
Oh, you would have done great.
I probably would have. I guess the clues damn near before everyone.
What the hell...
Ten thousand right here.
There must be over a million dollars in here.
What are we going to do?
What do you mean what are we going to do?
Call it in I guess. Why?
No. We can't.
Look around you partner! You said yourself you never saw anything like it.
We don't know whose money it is! They might have robbed a bank, who knows?
Robbed a bank, c'mon! Don't you think we would have heard if one, two -- shit I don't know how many were at large! Don't you think there would be a bulletin? This is a big ass drug deal!
We don't know that.
Come on Booth! Look at these scumbags around us. Who's going to know what happened! Let's take it and get out of here!
Well someone's gonna find them.
It won't work.
Why?
I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!
We would never have to worry about money -- ever again, Jesus!
Suppose someone knows about the money? They're bound to ask questions.
Who's going to question us? Dwayne? Jesse?
It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?
I'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen!
What makes you so sure?
It's no accident we stumbled on this money. It's an answer to a prayer! Every night and every day I've prayed that God would just -- help me out a little, give me a little push. Tonight my prayer came true.
Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?
That's right!
At the expense of six people.
All right hold on! Lemme think... Shit, did you touch the car?
I do. It's little shit like that sends people to jail! We have to cover all the bases if we're going to pull this!
We'll torch the bases, how's that?
We'll leave a few packets in the trunk, and stash the rest somewhere else. Car went up in the gunfight.
I've got one condition.
We're going to be patient. If we start flashing money around, buying fancy cars and fancy clothes, people are going to ask questions.
Shhh!
What are you gonna do?
I don't know! Son of a bitch! Who the hell are you?
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
I'm not letting some gangbanger send me to jail. We can't risk it.
I don't know...
You're thinking about killing him. I can't do that. No way. I've never killed a man. Never even shot at one...
Well neither have I, but it's us or him. If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in. Besides, he's a low life scumbag. His kind is hardly even human anyway.
I...I can't do that.
Okay then. I'll do it.
That's not what I mean.
I tell you it was a miracle the way things turned out --
I don't want to hear about miracles and God and all that! We tried to murder someone to cover our asses!
Look. Dwayne was right. This is going to be a big story. So big in fact that I don't want to even have this money around.
Fair enough, I'll take it to my place.
We're dead. We're dead, We are dead... What are we going to do?!
I don't know...
I don't know you want me to put on my cape and fly there?! We're going to play it cool... besides there might be nothing on that tape anyway...
That guy was a Federal agent. An officer of the law, just like us.
Well, we didn't know that at the time.
We assaulted a Federal agent. We killed him.
No we didn't. He died on his own.
We gotta turn ourselves in, before they hear the tape.
Are you nuts? They'll fry us for sure. There's no way we're doin' that, you understand? No way.
It's the right thing to do.
I should have known something like this was going to happen!
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
Shit! We're gonna have to get rid of him. I'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life. We can't risk it.
What are you thinking?
You're thinking about killing him. I can't do that. No way. I've never killed a man. Never even shot at one.
Well neither have I, but it's us or him. If he talks, or writes a note or whatever, he's gonna turn us in. Besides, he's just a low life scumbag. His kind is hardly even human anyway.
I can't do that.
That's not what I mean.
Listen. Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene. You know what they'd do.
He would have done it to us, right?
I could kill that no good son of a bitch!
All right enough! I'm tired of thinking about all this!
Well I'm not! Thinks he's got us by the balls.
...Or get rid of the money. I don't know.
I've got a better idea. All we have to do is straighten out Jesse.
And how do you figure we do that?
All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape. We'll set him up somehow.
He's probably made copies. He's not going to give them up to us.
He's going to be trouble.
We had a deal! What was I, talking to the wall?
You said that last time!
You're out of your mind.
You think he's bluffing?
No.
Look, Earl. We gotta go straight. This is all messed up...
If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!
Maybe we can reason with Jesse, give him a third in exchange for the tape.
I don't think he's going to be doing any bargaining with us, the stupid son-of-a-bitch! Besides, I'm not giving him a third of anything, not after everything we had to do.
Well what are we supposed to do?
You're crazy.
How badly do you want that money?! How bad do you want to stay out of jail?
Not bad enough to kill him.
How long is it going to take?!
What are you thinking? We were only supposed to scare him!
Here it is.
Even if we have the tape, that wouldn't shut him up!
You killed him...
It's gonna be o.k.
Jesus Christ Earl...what are we doing?...
We're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves!
You don't know if he was really gonna --
Maybe we should say somethin'.
Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
Do you have everything?
I don't know for sure, but why else would they head for the bank?
It was all used. Random numbers. How can they trace it?
I don't know. They got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.
Then we're screwed.
We're not? How do you figure that?
We'll take the money and disappear! We can do it, spend it on the move. Even if all of it's marked, there's ways around it.
We've got to go now, then.
That's right.
Oh Jesus...
He killed her...he killed her...
What happened? What's Earl doing here?
He found us, he shot her...he killed her...
Booth, listen to me...Booth!
We got to get out of here. Do you understand? We got to get out of here right now!
No. It stops now. It stops here.
Dwayne's dead.
What are you talking about?
It's too late...
It's NOT too late!
You're the one who's nuts! There's no one left to touch us, Booth. We're home free! We just plant a little of the money on Dwayne, and it's all ours.
Just one more. This one knocks off all the rest.
That'll bring me down, too. Eventually. You gotta know that.
Uh huh.
And you're solid on that?
You gentlemen look like you're about to toss your collective cookies.
Why don't you get to the point.
Listen Earl. I covered for you. For both of you. I put my ass on the line to save yours, so don't pull a hostile tone with me!
What's your offer, Jesse?
Besides, I'm not stupid, Earl. The tape was a basic Maxell D-80. You can buy 'em at any store. There's no way they can pin anything on me.
All right, Jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition.
I'm all ears.
Well, I don't know...
Ok...I'll wait. For now. But I'm going to need a little advance, to oil the wheels, so to speak.
How much?
I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you?
Two thousand...
There's going to have to be a change in our arrangement.
What are you proposing?
I don't like getting grilled by that DEA bitch, I don't like taking that kind of heat!
None of us like it!
Well I don't know what's going to happen next -- she's pressing this, another interrogation, another problem.
Just take it in stride.
I was beginning to think you weren't going to show. That can't be all of it.
You don't expect us to believe that do you?
Come on, Booth. Don't let him do this!!!
Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!
You're only screwing yourselves over! Helllllp! HELLLLLP! SOMEBODY!!!
Shut up, Jesse.
Whoa, Earl!
OKAY! IT'S UNDER MY DESK!! TAPED TO THE BOTTOM SIDE!!!
How are ya?
Thank you. Now, do you remember seeing any vehicles traveling near the site, on your way to or from?
No. Why?
Could it have been in the Mercedes?
Normally we would have tracked him with a wiretap, but it was standard for him to occasionally drop out when working with these guys. The last we heard from him was two days ago.
You mean that guy was an agent?
Well, we have one lead and that's what I'm looking into next.
What's that?
Yeah? So?
I have to go to the bank before it closes.
What for?
There's an ATM on Speedwell Avenue.
Well, not that I wouldn't sugar bun but Earl's in a bind. They're going to take his car.
Ah hell, he'd do the same for me.
Has he?
Get a room in a nice hotel for a few hours...
Hi.
Hi.
Yeah.
It was all over the local news. Dwayne was there, acting all official.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing's wrong.
Oh. You coming by tonight?
OK.
Are you sure you're OK?
Yeah I'm fine.
I'm just tired is all. I'll see you tonight OK baby?
OK. I love you.
Sally? I was beginning to think he wasn't gonna leave.
You got me something? What's the occasion?
What happened to your cheek? SALLY Oh I...nothing...
Nothing happened?
Like hell it's over. You told me he wasn't doing this anymore.
He's not, he's...
That son of a bitch.
Let's not get into this again. I know him. If you said something, he'd take it out on me.
And I'd take it out on him.
And I'd end up a widow in two ways. Let's forget it. I'll just be a little more careful next time.
You're worth every last penny.
I told him I bought the lingerie, as a surprise. I don't think he suspects anything, but now you know, if he mentions it.
How the hell did he find it?
He started digging through my closet, something he never does.
Great...
It's OK, Booth, it's no big deal.
Let's hope so. SALLY If he asks me again, I'm gonna tell him I returned it all.
Dammit, I'm so sick of this.
I know.
Every night I think about you sleeping with him, him slobbering all over you.
He doesn't slobber, he just snores. And I told you we haven't...done anything in over a year.
It doesn't matter...he's next to you. You know, I always say to myself, you should have left him years ago. Why didn't you?
Let's just get out of here, get out of this -- place. We'll drop out, get a house have some kids, get a satellite dish...
I hate it when you talk like this. Go on.
We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...
So do I.
I love you Sally.
A satellite dish?
How are we going to do all this?
I'm going to quit. That's what has to happen first. Then we're going to tell him.
I don't know, Booth.
When do you expect this inheritance stuff to be straightened out?
Shouldn't be long. A couple of weeks maybe.
Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
Why does that bother you?
I'm not sure why. It's just, I've never been anywhere else...
Sally there's a whole world out there. We can have a new home. A real home, not some tin-plated dump. What are you giving up?
I don't know. My friends...
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
Yeah, I guess you're right. It's just...all so sudden...
Do you wanna tell me what that was all about?
Things just got a little screwed up, that's all.
I don't believe it.
Sally, do you love me?
Yeah, I've seen him.
What did he buy?
I don't remember. We get a lot of people in here.
Be more specific. A month, a week...
A week ago, at most.
Test the product?
Yeah.
Business is business. Now where the hell is it? I wanna get out of here. That's the plan, we're just flunkies, you know what I'm saying?
You didn't answer my question. Are you saying my word is of no value to you?
I have a better plan. You want to hear it?
What?
And what's that?
How about you give us what you have and leave.
What?
What is this? Don't be stupid man...
All right, deputies, take care, don't let your meat loaf.
Don't worry the real men are in charge now.
Why?
What makes you say that?
I don't know.
What do you think about all this?
I guess we can get started.
He kept a recording of all such transactions in order to keep track of who's who, what was said, what's happening. I contacted your local coroner, and he found it taped to his back.
That's news to me. So it's over at Jesse's office?
Yeah. I told him I'd be there before five.
Well nothing audible to us. Maybe the lab can pick something up.
Well we'd like to help you in any way we can. We're all in this together, as law enforcement officers.
Uh, no...
Maybe. Maybe not.
What are you getting at?
Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.
Why would someone do that?
Oh that was Agent Wallace. We're going to check into something.
Don't you have to be here?
Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all.
We don't know. Whoever got this payload together has one hell of a laundering system.
Have you known this all along?
Well you can understand why we didn't say anything. If word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.
Sheriff Hogan --
Dwayne.
Dwayne... It is imperative that we keep this confidential. Now we know someone's out there. Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
OK...this is good. Our first solid lead.
Mr. Curtis called us this afternoon. The bills arrived at this branch from a cash drop. Came through a store called After Midnight. There's only four employees, none of them can tell us who passed them.
Some of it. Denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.
Yeah.
What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
Not exactly. It's some lingerie store on the strip.
Lingerie...
Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?
Hello.
Anything I can help you with?
I have an anniversary coming up, thought I'd buy her something special.
Anything...specific?
Sixty five... Jeez Louise!
Yeah, she is. She comes up to about here on me.
Hmmm...
I don't suppose you've seen her.
Have I seen her?
Shopping here?
No, I can't say that I have.
Let's see...do you know her cup size?
Uh...C?
C?
Yeah I'd say C...C.
Do you know...34 C? 32 C?
Well...I should have done a little homework, getting all the sizes, and what not.
Sure.
I'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.
Oh, that's ok, a lot of men feel uncomfortable when they come in here.
A lot of men come in here?
Just goes to show you.
Damn its hot in here...
Very clumsy, very clumsy. Id have found it in a minute.
All right youre the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
No. But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and Im a busy man.
Aw, now thats gonna take time to clear!
Do you even have a girlfriend, Jesse?
She's not his type.
Jesse?
I'm at a payphone in Vegas. What's up?
Vegas! Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
Why?
Well, we got the DEA coming down here again, I don't know, sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us.
About what?
Well they really didn't go into any details on the phone, but they did ask for you, and I figure we should try to help them out as best we can.
Uh, sure. I hear you.
So be here at three.
I'll do my best...that doesn't give me much time.
I have complete faith in you. But don't you go speeding.
Nice of you to join us. I did say three o'clock, didn't I?
Something wrong, Jesse?
No. Something wrong with you Dwayne?
You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.
What's this?
Hey where's the hot pad?
What?
Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?
I can't hear a word you're saying!
It was going to be a surprise!
What are you saying?
I'm saying you're about as romantic as a bag of sand.
Nothing. Nothing's the matter. SALLY Aren't you going to tell how your day went?
Not much to tell. Nothing really happened.
Suppose I'm not exciting enough for you.
I didn't say that. You did.
Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...
Don't you want to hear about my day?
Yeah let's hear about your day.
Whatever...
No, Dwayne, you go ahead and relax, have a six pack and fall asleep in front of the TV, and come upstairs and pass out. And do it all over again tomorrow!
Save me the sermon. I've heard it all before, it's boring.
You shut your mouth you son of a bitch!
Dwayne put the gun down --
You'd do this to me?!
Dwayne -
Dwayne please calm down!
Hey we're all friends, right? Friends don't squeal on friends, that's not what Jesse Segundo is all about.
I'll settle for a third of that.
And if we refuse? Your tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that?
We're out of here.
Meet me at the Tumbleweed Diner.
What?
I'm not asking.
Well you're not getting, either.
What do you mean? You gambled it?
I was on a roll! Im a little overextended now.
Oh Jesus Christ...
So I want the money and I want it now.
You want to see how more unglued I can get? Try me.
You're never getting that much.
What the hell are you doing, you crazy some bitches --
I don't suppose you'll tell us where the tape is.
Don't hurt me.
Easy to purchase, hard to detect. Too much potassium can kill a man. Just have to...pick a discreet spot.
Hi ma.
I didn't know you were coming.
I was in the neighborhood.
Is that the mail?
How's work?
People have been asking me about that story in the paper. I told them you were the first person on the scene. They were asking me for all the details.
It was pretty gory ma, let me tell you. But you have to turn all that off, and do your job, just like pop used to say.
Did they ever find out who they were?
Nope. If you're a criminal you don't carry ID, and if you do you're a damn fool.
I tell you this world just keeps getting more and more violent.
At least around here it does.
Are you hungry?
Yeah sure I'll grab something before I go... Hey -- I've got a surprise.
There was this raffle going on at the station, some charity or church was running it, I forget, so I figure what the hell put in my five bucks...
And what happened?
Well what do you know! An air conditioner.
And not just any air conditioner. This baby sells for over six hundred dollars retail.
That's great Earl!
This whole place?
Don't you want it?
Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough. Besides, I want you to have it.
Well I don't know --
Thank you honey. are you sure you don't want it?
You want to hear the good news first, or the bad news?
Give me the bad news.
We retrieved a few things from the trunk, including a steamer trunk, or the remnants of a trunk, the brass clips and so forth.
Anything in it?
But nowhere near three million dollars worth. I would say maybe twenty thousand.
There was more than that.
Not in the trunk.
That doesn't tell us much. Did you run a check on the gas like I told you?
Yeah, we did. It was unleaded, high octane.
That fire was set. Deliberately. And probably not by anyone found at the scene.
So someone did get away.
I don't know how else you'd explain it. The coroner's estimated time of death for everyone there was long before this fire started, unless of course Denning started it, and that doesn't make much sense.
No, it doesn't. Neither does his blank tape. Any news on that?
He didn't make it into work, and he's not home.
I knew it, I knew it all along - shit!
You think he skipped town?
Yeah.
This isn't right...
I'm not getting an answer.
Is it true, Carter? Are you in Hong Kong right now?
Hong Kong? I'm not in Hong Kong. I'm in Hollywood -- right at Sunset and Vine, two minutes from the station. How about I pick you up right now and take you to dinner?
It's nine-thirty in the morning.
Did I say dinner? I meant diner. Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.
Do you know what happened yesterday, Carter? I was officially nominated for the Commissioner's post for the LAPD. There was a dinner last night, two hundred LAPD officers were there.
Two hundred cops? Was Mario Sanchez there? He owes me money.
I've waited my whole life for this job, but I don't have a shot in hell of getting it. Do you know why?
Is it because of the hookers, sir? You tell them there's no crime in being lonely.
