Just drive, man. It's fucking nuts!
What's this all about, Connie?
What are you doing?
They're methodical. They're nothing if they're not that.
Who?
C.R.S. Who do you think? Jesus H., thank your lucky charms. To think what I almost got you into.
Yeah, almost...
You dodged a bullet.
How do you mean, exactly?
They fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you. And then, just when you think it's done, that's when the <u>real</u> fucking begins.
Slow down, take a breath...
It doesn't stop, Nick. I paid the bill, I gave 'em their money, but it all started again. They won't leave me alone...
What have they been doing to you?
Everything. I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
Calm down. Why would they keep playing after you paid?
It's them. They did this.
It's a flat tire. That's all.
How do you know?
We're going to figure this out. Get a grip on yourself.
The phone's dead.
Really?
Do you know how to change a tire?
How did those... ?
You're part of it...
No! You're one of them. Of course, it makes perfect sense!
No, it doesn't! Those keys were put there. I didn't even know...
You're behind this, aren't you? You and your sick friends. Well, make it stop!
Listen to yourself. Why would I do anything like what you're describing?
Because you hate me. Because you had to be here, when mom died. Because you had to do it alone. Well, don't you think if I'd known... I'd've been here too. I'd have been here...
Stop this. It's not true...
I'm sorry, Christ, I'm sorry! How many more times do I have to say I'm sorry before you forgive me... ?
You know... how'd you manage the gun? I mean...
What?
Really?
Yeah.
Split it?
Oh, God yes please. Thanks, man. I'll take you up on that.
Where's Christine? The waitress.
Yeah, yeah. She called a cab. Said something about catching a plane.
No money, no identification or passport. You are in a fix. What did happen to you?
Well, where to begin. It's complicated...
What happened was, I'm on vacation, alone... I was robbed, at gunpoint. They hit me and ran. Two men, a few blocks away. They took my wallet, money... all of it. So...
Robbed?
Yes.
Have you gone to the police?
We'll help with the police, if you want to bother. As far as money goes... can I make a suggestion? You say you were mugged?
Yes.
How much is it? A few thousand, at least. A Rolex like that... lucky for you they missed it.
I need your car, Elizabeth.
What happened to you, Nick? I mean, look at yourself...
I know, look at me, well... What happened? I don't know. I don't even really know. I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while.
The last few days, um... I've been thinking... had a lot of spare time. I want to tell you... I'm starting to understand why you left me. I've been resenting you for it, maybe, but ... I want to apologize, for all of it. For shutting you out, for not being there. I... Anyway, I hope you can forgive me.
There's nothing to forgive.
It would mean a lot to me... if you and I could be friends. If I could have you back in my life... in some small way. It would be important.
It's just a t.v. He's just an actor.
I'll explain someday.
We have to head out... just wanted to say goodbye.
You're going? Well, thanks again. Good to see you, Rachel... Thanks for coming, Mel. I'll get your car back. Right now it's, uh... at the zoo. Sorry.
Happy Birthday, Nicholas.
I'll call. I really will.
Jim Feingold, V.P., E.D.A. Engineering and Data Analysis.
I'm not quite sure how this works. My brother...
V-A-N... O-R-T-O-N... A gift from Conrad Van Orton. Interesting...
Your brother was a client with our London branch. We do a sort of informal scoring. His numbers were outstanding. Sure you're not hungry at all... ? Tung Hoy, best in Chinatown...
No, thank you.
I don't write the questions. I just review them.
What's all this for?
We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...
No, I mean, what is it FOR? What are you selling?
Oh... it's a game.
A game?
Tailored specifically to each participant. Think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you.
What kind of vacation?
It's different every time.
Humor me with specifics.
We provide whatever's lacking.
And if nothing's lacking?
May I make two suggestions... ?
Do you really expect me to participate without knowing a single thing?
How long will these take?
An hour for those... maybe another for the physical.
Physical?
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Don't worry. It's been terrific spending the entire day with your "crack team".
One guarantee. Payment's entirely at your brother's discretion and, as a gift, dependent on your satisfaction.
You mean, I don't like it, he doesn't pay?
It's never happened. We've never had an unsatisfied customer.
You mean, <u>dis</u>satisfied.
Get rid of them.
Look, it was just a job. Nothing personal, ya know? I play my part, improvise a little. That's what I'm good at.
I'm tired of dealing with peons. I need to get to whoever's in charge.
Goddamnit, why do they do that?
How do I find them? Their offices are empty.
They know you... you worked for them. You can get me in.
No, I can't. I'm sorry and all, but...
Tell them the cops are after you... tell them you've got to talk to someone, I'm threatening to blow the whistle.
Drive in.
What are you gonna do anyway? You won't get your money back.
You don't need me...
Where?
I told you, they hired me over the phone. I never met anyone.
Where'd you pick up your checks?
It was a different floor then...
Guess!
I need the police.
You know, these fit... perfectly.
I've been so lonely.
I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.
Don't be nervous. They said you'd be nervous.
Isn't this what you like? They told me you had a thing for boats.
Ah, Mr. Van Orton. Here you go...
Show Mr. Van Orton to his room.
The key?
Hm?
Is there a room key?
Didn't I give you two?
Thank you.
Dinner's in the oven.
You did? How is he?
Okay. I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
Is everything alright?
Fine.
I've finished for the evening. Will you be needing anything else?
No, thank you. Goodnight.
Mr. Van Orton... ?
Ilsa... you're alright?
Yes. What do you mean? What's wrong?
Did the alarm go off? The house... they... you didn't see... ?
I don't know what you're talking about. What's happened?
What makes you ask?
All the time I've known you, you've never once asked about him.
Your mother thought he was a good man. He worked very hard. What I remember most was his manner was so... slight. It was easy to spend time in a room, and not realize he'd been there the whole time.
Was he morose, or...? I mean...
No. What happened... no one expected it.
Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
Not much, I think.
I'm just like him.
You're not like him at all. I don't know exactly what's going on around here lately, but don't make me start worrying about you.
Did you worry about him?
Goodnight. See you home.
What's the trouble?
Pleasure to meet you, I'd like to see my brother, thank you.
Your brother. Will you come with me?
What's this about?
It's a private matter, for you... I think you'll be more comfortable...
There were complaints by other guests, and damage to his room. We did the best we could to accommodate his behavior.
His behavior... ?
He couldn't, or refused to pay. We extended credit...
Look, where is he?!
Invitations: the Museum Gala.
No.
The Fitzwilliam Botanical Garden Annual Fundraiser.
No.
The Hinchberger wedding.
Let me think... Hordes of men in tuxedos. Everyone's droning. Ludwell's trying to break the ice by reciting an off-color limerick...
I'll send your regrets. Honestly, why must I even bother?
Your ex-wife.
I don't like her.
I wouldn't mention the following, except he was very insistent. It's obviously some sort of prank...
What?
A gentleman left a message requesting a lunch, but I assured him...
What gentleman, Maria?
"Under the Bleachers"... by Seymour Butts.
Pardon me? I'm afraid I don't...
What the fuck... ?!
Why are you following me?
Look... what I'm doing is none of your business...
Is Alan Baer "the Game?" Is that what this is?
Hey... !
Anything wrong... ?
I wasn't expecting you.
Attractive...
Don't ask.
What's happened...
Nicholas...
How concerned should I be?
Someone's playing hardball. It's complicated. Can I ask a favor?
You know you can.
Find out about a company called C.R.S. Consumer Recreation Services.
Sounds like they make tennis rackets. What do we know?
Just what I told you.
Christ... I can't believe it... invisible ink?
You're joking.
Very well. If you tell me not to worry, I shan't.
He hasn't called back.
Illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment...
Bravo, young man. you have to tell me what this was all about sometime. I want you to know... when it looked there for awhile like you were going slowly insane... I was fully prepared to have you committed to the <u>finest</u> mental-health facility available. I mean that sincerely, don't thank me.
Hi. I'm Todd Aubochon.
Greetings fellow insomniac.
These old Victorian houses are great, aren't they?
You know what I love about wine that comes in bottles like this?
What?
Hi, Luke Sanderson, bad sleeper, I'm your basic tosser-turner, and you are...
Uh... Nell Vance...
And what kind of sleeper?
Well, I... uh...
I only saw Theo drive up.
The children. The children Hugh Crain built the house for. The children he never had.
Couldn't get the last ones. You?
Welcome Home Eleanor. Welcome Home? I've never been here. Who did this?
Modelling small-group dynamics in the formation of narrative hallucinations. You brought us here to scare us. Insomnia, that was just a decoy issue. You're disgusting.
And this is my assistant, Mary Lambretta.
So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test?
That could have been worse.
Luke, can I talk to you?
Sure.
Because... well, I know I can trust you.
Why?
Do you need me anymore? Cause I'm going to bed. They can stay up talking another 45 minutes if they want, but I gotta try to get some sleep.
And those are Luke's and mine.
I gave my key to the gate to Todd, but the Dudleys'll be here in the morning.
Do we still get paid for the week?
Is that the question of compassion or science?
It's a question.
It's not going to hold your weight.
You're not telling us something.
The rest of you may hate your insomnia, but I find it the best time of the day for me. I'm alone. Nobody's talking to me but myself. My mind is racing with ideas, and I can think.
He said that Hugh Crain... Hugh Crain was a monster. He said that he was a brutal, horrible man. He told me that Crain drove his workers to early deaths. Crain had children chained to the looms in his mill. And listen to this: his beautiful Rene killed herself.
Hey! I heard screaming...
Well, this lot is full!
I didn't do it.
You could have.
So could you! Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?
Mister very talky, would you please say what it is about this study that bothers you?
We're fucked. We're in a haunted house and we can't get out until the morning.
You don't really believe it's haunted... Do you believe in ghosts?
That depends on your definition of ghosts. I'm going to check on her, and then I'm going to stay awake.
All night?
Yeah.
You want company?
You used the wrong test.
Nell --
Was sure she'd be in here.
Nell!
It's still an electric shock!
Malcolm, this is essential work I'm doing. Just think what my research can do for education. Elementary school classrooms near train tracks or airports, where loud noise is random; this helps to prove the need for sound insulation if the children are ever going to learn to read.
And that will be a good place to end this study.
No, Malcolm! Individual performance is only part of it. I know why baseball players choke for no reason, I know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what I want to know is, how fear works in a group...
Not the way you've constructed your group, it's just not ethical!
Are you working with her?
Why are you working with her? Mary Lambretta was thrown out of the department for trying to get a Ph.D. in psychic studies.
And after she was thrown out, she needed a job.
You don't believe in the paranormal.
No, but she does, and that's all that matters.
Does she know that's why you're using her?
No.
I, I just can't...
She needed a job, Malcolm. And she's smart. And she helps me.
I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
Eleanor, how was the drive?
You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.
Nell. Good enough. And I'm Jim.
I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim.
You wrote that you had trouble sleeping.
All the carvings.
The cold sensation. Who felt it first?
Theo I think. You've asked us that three times, Doctor Marrow. What's going on?
Sorry.
Nell! What's wrong?
What did it smell like?
It was very specific.
All right...
In the bathroom in my mother's room, the toilet was next to an old wooden table. It smelled like that wood.
So... smell... is... Smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories. And a memory can trigger a smell.
I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.
What happened after you smelled it?
I looked at Theo. She had a look on her face.
Like she smelled it too?
Yes.
And then what happened?
Hmm.
I'm sorry. I'm messing up the study.
Are you coming to confess?
Let's say it wasn't you. Who did it?
I don't know.
It was a stupid thing to do.
It was.
Welcome Home.
You'll never see it again. Mr. Dudley's taking care of it. I'm sorry, Nell. Can I show you something you'd like to see?
Someone is playing with you.
Why?
I don't know.
What is that tune?
Nell... please, Nell... take a deep breath...
I hadn't done a study of how group fear affects individual performance. Mass hysteria is like a story, Nell. A communal story. Someone starts it. Then we all add a little more to it. And then for some reason -- no one knows how -- we start believing it. This story shapes what we see and hear. We interpret everything through it, make it
Why would we want to do that, Nell?
The children want me. They're calling me. They need me.
But you told me to look in the paper! You told me I'd be perfect!
Nell, the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.
No.
Come on.
What'll happen to us, Nell?
You know what he's really upset about?
What?
You hear the vibrations in the wire. There's a magnetic pulse in the wires, you feel it. I could test it.
Yes, this is Doctor Marrow.
How'd I know it was for you?
Here's how they're organized. Groups of five, very different personalities: scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for. And they all score high on the insomnia charts.
What's this? What's this... this picture?
That? That's Hill House.
This is where we're going?
What happened?
Have either of you seen David Watts?
When do we take the tests?
Well this is a cozy breakfast.
Maybe they're Mary's.
Get a blanket!
Your fear of him was real. That's all the ghost anyone needs.
Is she asleep?
She needs help.
He's wandering around the house, and Nell heard him. She thought it was ghosts. Let's go look for him again.
Oh God, we can't get out!
I'm not going back to New York City. I'm going to find an apartment with a little flower garden, where you can just see the ocean and at night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the sound of the harbor. What about you?
I'm a scientist. I just conducted an experiment. Now I have to write it up.
What do you want?
Oh! You scared me.
Me? No. What are you doing here?
Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?
Yeah, I'm Mister Dudley, the caretaker. What are you doing here?
Why do you need a chain like that?
Is there something about the house?
That's where she hanged herself.
Who?
Why?
Why'd she kill herself?
Yes.
She was unhappy.
Why?
It's make the soup or answer the door. Can't do both.
Mrs. Dudley.
They're so beautiful. Aren't they?
I've seen 'em. Lot to dust.
It's a job. I keep banker's hours. I set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six. You can serve yourselves. Breakfast is ready at nine. I don't wait on people. I don't stay after dinner. Not after it begins to get dark. I leave before dark comes. We live in town. Nine miles. So there won't be anyone around if you need help.
Why would we --
No one could. No one lives any nearer than town.
And what you're wearing, that's great, too.
This? It's from a thrift shop.
What did it cost?
Fifteen dollars.
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
It's all I could afford.
Wait. You're not wearing that ironically? This is really you?
Don't worry, I probably won't be in here much. Light sleeper.
That's why we're here.
What do you do?
I'm between jobs right now. My last job... it... the person I was working for... the job ended. Over. So... And you?
Not really.
Don't tell me Boston is different from New York.
Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.
My boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn't. If we could all live together... but... they hate each other. It's hard to be Miss Perversity when you're the only one at the party. D'you know what I mean?
No.
A blank canvas! I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not. So, you? Husbands? Boyfriends? Girlfriends? Where do you live?
Jeez.
I love this house. I really love this house.
A monster? But he built this for the woman he loved, like the Taj Mahal.
You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you?
Yes. I've missed it.
Good night, Theo.
If this was some sort of joke, I'm going to kill him.
Yes. I feel realy rested, too. Theo?
How could he have left without his keys?
Watts?
What's his first name?
David.
David?
Is it over?
Theo... Did you?
Maybe you did it yourself.
Why?
That's so sad.
There's hundreds of them. This must be a record of the children who died at the mills, like Luke said.
Well, it wasn't me. Mister Dudley had to clean it and he knows that he's in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work for himself and... You said the Good Doctor was with you.
I don't know what to think anymore.
I've never had a pedicure before.
Well?
I'm sorry I was mad at you, Theo.
I'll take that as a compliment. In the city, what kind of place do you live in?
You want to move to New York, you want to move in with me?
My place isn't like yours, Nell, it doesn't have a view of sea. It doesn't have a view of anything. What's interesting about the way I live is what goes on inside the walls. Living with me... My boundaries aren't very well defined, Nell. Do you know what I mean?
Are you sure?
I think so.
Marrow said the same thing as last night, he <u>says</u> -- -- that he checked with Mrs. Dudley. And he says that she told him that all the fireplaces in the West Wing connect to the main chimney. He says that he thinks that the flue was open, and with the windstorm, he says that what probably happened was some kind of freak air
Then who is? Come on, Nell. Deep down, if you really thought it wasn't Jim, why wouldn't you be leaving right this second? Why wouldn't you be afraid? Really afraid.
Nell, what happened?
This is real, I'm not making it up! Theo, you saw it! You were there -- the banging and last night. You, you all saw the painting!
Nell, it makes sense. It all makes sense. You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.
I'm going to stay with you until you fall asleep. And then I'm going to get some brandy.
I don't think I want any.
They're all in here. All the ones he killed. They're just children! We have to help them!
What'd you come back for, babe?
Oh, Theo. You know I don't have an apartment.
Adhara. I told your father, if you're looking for a name, you can't go wrong with a constellation.
I used to hate it. Now I like it.
Is there anything in the world that you want or need?
I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.
Gordon? He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.
Then what good is he?
Is it possible that you're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?
Is that a problem?
Not for you, clearly.
I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
Am I a thing?
Well, you're certainly not a person.
I'm not.
No. You're not specific enough to be a person. You're more like a vibe.
I'm so glad we're having this chat.
It's not a knock.
It's not a compliment.
It's an observation. Like: I'm hungry. When are we eating?
As soon as you get dressed.
What kind of food?
Anything but Japanese.
Why?
I'm not into finger foods. Too fussy.
Like you.
I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. Buffets. Salad bars.
You demand to be served. A fork fetishist.
It's just fuel to me. I'm not there for distractions.
For some, eating is a sensual experience. <u>The</u> sensual experience.
That's what Gordon's always saying.
Italian?
I'm sorry.
Italian.
Who?
Not who, food. Should we get Italian.
I like the colors.
We all did.
Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet person.
I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive.
What's the matter?
Nothing. I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
We think someone is here.
We think?
No.
Why not?
Hey.
How they goin', kid?
Not bad.
How'd you like to kill someone for me?
Same as last time -- the rest after.
Where do we go?
When you find the guy, you'll know.
What shit is this. I just do it. I don't prepare it.
I'll point you in the right direction, but you'll have to take it to the end- zone. He's a hit-and-run gunman -- I figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge.
This is un-fucking professional.
See, a successful man like me has limitations -- I lose touch at a street level. So I have to depend on a smart boy like you who's closer to the nitty and the gritty than I am.
Fuck you, Mr. whatever-your-name is. This is a lifestyle I embrace.
What.
There's been some trouble downtown.
What kind?
What the papers used to call a "gangland slaying."
Our black friends?
No, Terry. They don't work like that. Jenny Wilson's father paid a little visit, left a message.
I thought he was in prison, in England.
You should have let me do the talking.
Why, because you're my security consultant? This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
I mean, Gordon must weigh a good four hundred pounds.
Heavier than that now. But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story.
As it happens. I didn't make that part up.
And where is this guest? Don't they want to interview him.
Where do <u>you</u> think he is, Mike.
We'll find him.
No. I mean. Not even your people should be involved. Right? It's too close now.
You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here.
You think I'm staying?
There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.
You broke last time.
Let him break - he likes to break.
Fuck you.
I wouldn't talk.
Huh?
Oh really? Where you from?
England. Only, we saw there was a show on, thought I might pick something up for a price, type of thing.
You came to the right place, sir. My wife's second cousin is English. Well, Scotch-Irish. Can I interest you in a holster?
Just luck, this, really. Never been to one of these before.
You're in gun country now, my friend.
Been to the Boat Show.
I can take care of the paperwork.
Yeah?
Man knows what he likes.
Lookin' good.
That's a high-end item. Total reliability.
What'd you call that -- the Protector?
CQ what?
Edward Rama?
Eduardo. Rama.
I didn't expect anyone.
No reason.
I mean, what has it been -- six months?
I didn't even know who I was writing to -- just someone with the same last name. She never talked about any family.
Who done it, then?
Huh?
I never said nothin' about nothin' like that. No, no, no. That's not what I wrote to you.
This bloke she was bunked up with. This Terry what'sit.
Terry Valentine.
Valentine. What's he got to say for himself?
What more is there.
Coulda happened to anyone, man. I never knew her to be reckless. I mean, sure, she would smoke a little grass, or something, have a few drinks. But that's it, nothing more than that.
No, not my girl. Self-control, she had. Point of pride. And people don't change, do they.
Boomerang.
Y'what?
I knew when I was droppin' that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face. I did my time, okay? My sister, her ol' man's up in Chino right now doin' eight years.
This ain't your lot?
I go to work, try to keep my life together, put all that shit behind me, man. What d'you want from me.
What, tryin' to catch him with another bird?
That's what I thought, man. But it was not a hotel or nothin' that we went to. It was someplace else.
Bad place, man. Bad people. Some guys loading some trucks. Some kinda deal goin' down. I don't know and I don't care. Maybe they're shipping fava beans to Eskimos.
Did Jenny know?
What you gonna do, man? You gonna go to the cops?
Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.
You should talk to Elaine. That was her best friend.
She didn't write to me, did she.
She didn't know what to say. I thought someone should say something. To someone. With me it was, I don't know -- Jenny liked me for some reason. I felt like I owed her.
Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass or whatever?
Not me, man. I'm no drug dealer, what you think.
I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service.
I already told you, man. Corcoran. Know what that is? State prison.
Nick's a nick, n' it? No matter what state you're in. State of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught.
You're kiddin' me, right?
What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages?
These are not guys you can just go run a number on, man.
Are you a resident of California? You gonna fill out forms, man? Do the background check? Go through a three-day waiting period?
Sod that. Gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where I've skived off to.
Probation? Man, you crazy. They shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison.
He don't have a concealed weapons permit.
No. Not at all. Do we?
Not me, man.
You hadda show up on a weekend. This weekend. Wouldn't've even been a gun show ... for another month.
Now what. You gonna take your new arsenal, go visit Terry Valentine, just like that? Boom bam boom.
It's only insurance. Can't be too careful. This Terry Valentine, he's probably a wonderful fella. They were together how long?
Five years, I think. Long time.
Jenny told me she met him at the beach. Got blinded by his smile. You believe that shit? Son of a bitch never smiled at me. Buried her at a "private" service. Private for who. Him?
Hang about. I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny.
He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work. That's not where they met.
And that's where you met Jenny.
No, no -- Jenny used to work as a waitress. Before she met him. But that's not where she met me. Not in my restaurant.
How'd the two of you hook up, then?
Told you you wouldn't be able to see through that gate.
Gate's open. I had a butcher's at the house.
Who'd you butcher at the house?
Butcher's hook. Look. I don't much reckon those minders of his.
Huh?
He's brought in the heavy mob.
What?
Extra muscle. Bodyguards.
Has he?
That was one of them?
What's so fucking funny?
Valets. What d'ya mean valets. What is he, then, the Earl of fucking Doncaster?
Valets, eh? Aren't we all la-de-da.
I thought you just wanted to check out the house, man.
Well, that's what we're doin', n' it.
No one else is even here yet.
What are we standing on?
Bring the motor around. Bang out in front, right?
You goin' back inside?
Steady on.
Why didn't you just kill him, you had the chance.
That would be too easy.
Too easy?
He's gotta know why.
I've been wondering something.
Again?
Do you have any friends, man?
Useless gits. I was gonna do the Post Office once.
What post office?
What d'you say, Elaine?
Not much -- you?
Same.
Uh-huh.
Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing?
Probably.
I was gonna be in that Michael Mann movie, you know -- with Pacino and DeNiro. Got three callbacks.
Really.
Didn't get it.
Well, those are the breaks.
Not no more, they ain't. I quit that acting shit, man.
You just cooking then?
Hey, Elaine. You even know what he's saying half the time?
... Reminds me of Jennifer.
I thought maybe you just came for the ride.
Had a feeling it was you.
You look alike.
Perhaps it was the smoke.
Not her brand.
Why did you come here?
Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
Sort a few things out.
Been busy, have you.
How d'you mean?
It's been a while.
I was skint -- didn't have no money to get here.
That's not what I heard.
What was that, then?
I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure."
In any case, I don't suppose the salary you make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline travel.
Sewing mailbags? Me? Never did an honest day's work in my life, dear. Wasn't about to start when I was in stir -- not with all that leisure time on my hands.
And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out. From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it? Pink Floyd concert receipts. Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?
Hardly buried. Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that.
Here, aren't you gonna let me in.
... No, I went in for more improving pastimes. Philosophy classes, language courses, European history, all that lark. Did you know that in Paris in the Eighteenth Century there were more rats in people's houses than there were people in people's houses.
Sounds like Beverly Hills.
Here, are you always this sarky?
Sarcastic, moi? Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in. It's expected any day now. I'm all packed and ready to go.
Weren't you on a television series?
If it played in England somebody owes me money. Who told you that -- Eddie?
Said it went on for donkey's years.
Three seasons. They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail. I was wife number three -- the ingenue.
Oh, it just ended, then.
Now who's being sarcastic?
When you've lost as many years as I have, love, puts things in perspective, know what I mean.
I can't believe Jenny told you all that. About me. She was always so embarrassed.
Not embarrassed.
Ashamed.
Disappointed.
She never told Eddie, though.
She never told anyone else. About the convict strain -- or is it stain? No, I was privileged. I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past.
How'd you manage that, then.
When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach. Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress. Not with that look.
Yeah, well, she started all that in London.
Modelling.
You weren't disappointed in her, then.
In Jenny? 'Course not. How could I be. 'Course I wasn't.
She was twenty-one when she came to me. ... Straight from leaving you.
Footloose and fancy free.
When did you get in?
Yesterday. Afternoon.
You haven't been lurking outside my building all day.
No, I had -- some other matters to attend to, you know. Getting a car sorted ...
I might've been away for the weekend.
Well, I reckoned, Saturday night, if you were goin' out, you'd probably have to come home first.
And you've seen Eddie Rama.
I should really give him a call. He's a character, isn't he. Well, not to you. I meant to us squares in the outside world.
He give me your address.
I gave him yours. Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative. I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny. Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.
Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life. On her own after her mum died. Aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned.
Were you still married at the time -- to Jenny's mother, I mean?
The address Jenny gave me, that wasn't a prison, was it?
Nah, accommodation address.
What's that, like a P.O. box.
Something like that, yeah.
I already knew. Knew beforehand. When was it supposed to have happened? -- two o'clock in the morning, Eddie said.
That's what was estimated.
Do you even know who Terry Valentine is?
Lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing. Like me -- but on a grander scale of failure.
Now, you shouldn't run yourself down. My employer, Mr. Lindgren --
-- Your employer?
-- Mr. Lindgren.
Who's Mr. Lindgren?
My employer.
What line is he in.
Proprietor of a London firm. Of longstanding.
I see.
Based in London, but with international concerns.
I bet.
Various enterprises, style of thing.
I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life.
Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest, exactly.
Right.
Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave, never run yourself down, son -- 'cause there'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you.
In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren?
This and that. Y'know. Ways and means.
So what's the deal. You and Terry Valentine at twenty paces. Is that what this is about.
Why not.
Are you serious.
You fuckin' guys and your dicks.
What'd you want me to do. Stay at home, twiddlin' me thumbs. Doing sweet F.A. [Fuck All].
You don't believe it was a car accident.
What do you think.
Terry's never going to give you satisfaction. Not the type.
Depends, don' it.
On what. What makes you so certain.
I'll bloody well ask him.
Jenny was supposed to come to my place that night. She called me, asked if she could come over. She and Terry had been -- having some trouble. Lately. I don't know about what. On this occasion, it reached some sort of crisis point.
She told you all about my details but not about his. Lovely.
How did you come to have my address? Found it, did you. Among her things.
You think Terry gave me access to her things? Probably sold her clothes.
This town's been chewing my flesh since ... what we now refer to as "the early 70's." Christ, my past became nostalgia and no one even asked me.
Early 70's. I was away. Maidstone. Possibly Brixton.
You don't seem bothered.
You don't know how I've compromised my standards.
Tell us about it.
It's too involved; a lifetime of non- involvement. Anywhere else I'd be an interesting little number, here I'm just SAG number forty-eight thousand and one. SAG meaning Screen Actor's Guild.
Oh, I was gonna say ...
Still, there have been rewards. It's sunny. And some of the producers who call even have credits.
What did you do? To make them take the early 70's away from you.
A jeweller's up the West End. We tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road. Filthy work. Trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed -- <u>after</u> we'd made the grab, 'n all. Would you Adam n' Eve it.
You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess.
We were <u>lucky</u> to be nicked. Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday. Good job we were still breathing.
It didn't discourage you, though.
Hey?
From pursuing your chosen profession.
I'll tell ya something: it made me a model prisoner. Put me right off any escape attempts. Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience? Not bloody likely.
I was inside once. I punched a cop at a demo.
Did you. What was that in aid of?
Who remembers.
Get seven years, did you?
Overnight. What about just now?
Just now? Overnight?
You <u>have</u> been away. Or is all this just new to you?
It's true. Has to be said. I got off to a slow start.
I don't believe it.
Honest. Didn't know where to look till I was 21.
-- they want Southern, I do Southern, they want Midwest, I do Midwest, they want tall, blonde, and twenty-two, I'm shit out of luck. One thing I can't do is English. Americans can't. Shouldn't even try. And Laurence Olivier couldn't do us.
You ever been to London?
Only in the movies.
I've 'ardly ever left it.
Yeah, well, you're here now -- -- where <u>h</u>urricanes <u>h</u>ardly ever <u>h</u>appen.
I've got the hang of the driving. Found this place all right.
Not that I recall.
What about your grandmother?
Nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop. Crafty old sod.
He alive to see this?
Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon, Muswell Hill. Watching Doris Day.
What'd your father do?
I guess you're just habitual.
You sound like my fucking probation officer.
Won't he be looking for you about now?
Good luck to him. He couldn't find his prick if he didn't wear Y-fronts.
Minor officials bother you, don't they?
I got a steady income -- I'm on the dole.
A leech on the welfare state in addition. You don't miss a trick.
Last time might as well've been the first. I remember all the times, don't I. Watching her grow up -- in increments.
She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost. Coming back to haunt her.
Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO.
She used to tell me she'd turn me in. Little kid. Ten year old. "If you're naughty, Dad, I'll tell on ya." She didn't want me sent down again, see. When I was planning some job. "I'll tell 'em, Dad, I promise I will. Here, look, I'm calling the Old Bill right now" -- picking up the telephone. I can see her, the phone
She never would have turned you in, not in a million years.
Where's Big Sur?
Up the coast.
How far?
I don't know -- few hours, I guess.
Fancy it?
I could use a vacation. Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this <u>is</u> a vacation.
Never thought of that. Busman's holiday.
What's in Big Sur?
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
How do you know?
Friends and <u>colleagues</u>.
You can't count on very many people, that's the trouble. Number of times a decent job's been cocked up ...
You're just on a higher plane, Wilson.
There's one thing I don't understand. The thing I don't understand ... is every motherfucking thing you're saying.
Look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, I can see that, I'm on your manor now, right. So there's no need to get out of your pram. I'm Johnny-come-lately to all this. Whatever the bollocks between you and this slag Valentine, it's got nothing to do with me. I don't wanna know.
Well, I'll tell you. I believe this Valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of money.
I can well believe it. I'm sure he has done, son. He's about as straight as a dog's hind leg.
But I can't be sure. I don't even know who he is. He's too insulated. Too many layers around him.
Your guess is as good as mine, mate. I'm here on another matter entirely.
Yeah, I guess you are.
Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been <u>me</u> for the high jump.
That dude who works for Valentine. He's the one sent those guys after you. You know that.
Yeah. Shouldn't wonder. Must've done.
So what's your beef, pal?
Nothing financial. Strictly personal. I can see how all this import-export malarkey might give rise to confusion where I'm concerned. A foreigner, showing up unexpectedly, like.
It was you. Downtown.
Eh?
Because that wasn't anything to do with me. And suspicion has been cast in my direction. Didn't make any sense. Choosing those shitheads over me, cutting me out of the deal, then screwing them over too.
No, I can reassure you on that point. Valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you.
He'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut. Didn't think he'd be so bold as to take all of it.
All of what?
Of the deal, man.
Oh, yeah, right. The deal.
But if you're mad at him too and he's mad at you ... that must make us pals.
As you prefer, squire. As you prefer.
In which case I'll just do what I usually do.
And that is?
Valentine had himself a party, I hear.
My client has already given a statement regarding yesterday's events.
A <u>statement</u>? I wouldn't mind getting a statement. You see, <u>my</u> client -- the United States Government -- would love to get a statement about a few of the deals going down with your client.
Deals? My client is involved in any number of deals at any given moment. You'd have to be more specific.
Your client have a deal in Long Beach? How about downtown? There's some folks there -- oh, wait, they're all dead. Any of this ring a bell?
My client is an entrepreneur. I am his lawyer, not his business manager.
So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money.
He's always been very forward-thinking. He invested wisely.
Where is he now?
Don't you work with Ian?
Ian?
I could swear I met you with Ian at the EMI offices in London.
Sorry. Wasn't me.
You sure?
Unless I'm not who I think I am.
That's too bad. Ian's got a good thing going over there.
Yeah?
Turned that place completely around. 180 degrees.
No kidding.
What I like about Ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I'm saying?
Right. Chain of respect. That's good, that.
Yeah. I really admire the guy. Well. Good to meet you.
Yeah, that's right.
I would have preferred staying home, me.
You'll be looking forward to getting back, then.
Yeah. Another little matter needs attending to soon as I return.
Been away a lot.
Out on a oil rig. In the North Sea. Nine years.
Nine years? Is that legal?
Well, time off for good behavior, you know. I shouldn't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place. I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for. I don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what I mean.
But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.
I had to, didn't I. Nothing else for it. Then just when I'd finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger off to the States.
Sounds like you need a rest.
But first I gotta give these lads a talking to, these geezers what sent me up the river, in a manner of speaking.
The ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders.
How much.
Five thousand.
Hey.
I got half.
Makin' trouble for someone?
Yeah.
Which kind?
Ever take a look at the women who work in pet stores? Wow.
Good luck.
Jesus, are you gay enough or what.
Very attractive. Good idea. Now I <u>really</u> want to fuck you.
... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal.
Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it.
Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth.
Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching. Y'know. Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING. Or BIG FAT GUY. SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS. Wouldn't that be good?
Two blacks and a Mexican in a car. Who's driving?
I don't know.
Maybe she doesn't even know the English guy.
Avery said she was tight with his daughter.
She's nice lookin'.
So what.
I dunno. I just said she's nice lookin'.
And I said so what. You think she's any happier?
What d'you mean, any happier?
Straight rotation, no shit, call your shot.
We coulda used the other two-and-a-half grand.
There's more than a measly few grand in this.
There is?
Something's on.
What?
I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever- his-name-is than he thinks I know about him and his operation.
You do?
You bet.
Like what.
Like he'd never hire me for real. Not week-to-week. I don't have the credentials. He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs "plausible denial."
Well, we blew it, didn't we? He ain't wrong.
"He ain't wrong." Listen, I know this asshole who <u>did</u> just go to work for him. Full-time. And this dickhead's parents just told me he took a road trip up the coast. <u>That's</u> the type of individual gets hired, someone who'll shoot his mouth off to his family while on the job.
I don't get it.
I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of -- -- courier or something. Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer. But Mr. <u>Avery</u> wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere.
What's in it?
Drugs? Cash? Both if we're lucky.
How we gonna get that lucky?
How'd you get in here.
Walked.
You walked. What the hell are you doing here.
He's expecting you?
So why would he want to see you.
I have a message for him. About Jennifer Wilson.
You know her?
Is Valentine here?
Where is he, then?
Hello there.
What are you doing here?
Exercising my visitation rights.
Since when?
I miss my kids.
You've made it ... brighter.
I don't want you here, Terry.
What kind of trouble are you in?
Surely you can think of somewhere else to take one of your chippies for a quick getaway.
Where's ... what's-his-name -- Fred --
-- You know his name is Frank.
Is he here?
You know I don't live with him.
Go to him. Go to his studio, or writers workshop or artists colony, Esselin retreat, nudist camp --
Are you finished?
In a couple of days this whole thing --
Who's looking for you?
It's been five minutes and I'm packing to leave again. I can't believe this.
Pleasure.
Have we met? There's something I can't quite --
EMI in London. I work with Ian.
Ah.
You must know Ian.
I don't.
Great bloke. Really turned things around there. 180 degrees.
I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were.
Thanks. You, too.
What.
Tell me.
Tell you ...
She could've had the deal! I would've handed it to her if she wanted. I would have given her everything.
Hello, Ed.
...I'm so sorry about your loss.
Yes. Thank you.
Oh, I know. Don't worry, Ed. I came to tell you...
Yes, Ann?
Yes?
...Yes?
At night, there were lights--we both saw them. We never told anyone, outside of our official report.
Ann--
A spacecraft. I saw the creatures. They led Big Dave onto the craft. He never told anyone what they did, outside of his report. Of course he told *me*. No one else.
Ann--
The government knows. I cannot repeat it to you. But this thing goes deep, Ed. This was not your wife. I goes deep, and involves the government. There is a great deal of fear. You know how certain circles would find it--the knowledge--a threat. They try to limit it, and--
Ann, will you come in, sit down, maybe have a drink?
...You don't like the music out there?
Hello, Rachel.
I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.
He was deaf when he wrote this.
Who?
Hi, Mr Crane.
Hello, Birdy. I thought that was very good.
Oh, in there? I messed up a little bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr Crane.
Hello, Mr Crane.
Hello, Birdy.
Yeah.
We've certainly missed you.
...or maybe I just haven't played 'em right, I don't know. But you're--
Sure... Sure, it's his house.
Anyway, uh... my point is you're young. A kid really, your whole life ahead of you. But it's not too soon to start thinking... to start making opportunities for yourself. Before it all washes away.
Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so too. I work pretty hard at school.
That's swell. However, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only take you so far. There's this guy in San Francisco, I've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. Trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. His name is Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it
Boy.
You've got talent, anyone could see that. And he's the best. If he thinks a student has talent, he'll take 'em on for next to nothing. You're a cinch to be accepted, I could cover the cost of the lessons, like I said, it's pretty modest--
Oh, Mr Crane--
I have to do it. I can't stand by and watch more things go down the drain. You're young, you don't understand.
Geez, Mr Crane, I don't know. I hadn't really thought about a career or stuff.
I know you haven't. Look, just go meet him as a favor to me. I talked to this guy. Hope I pronounced his name right. He sounded very busy, but he's not a bad egg; he loosened up a little when I told him how talented you are. He agreed to see you this Saturday. He said maybe you were a diamond in the
Geez, Mr Crane.
...I stank, didn't I?
He didn't say that.
But more or less.
Look, I'm no expert, but--
It doesn't matter, Mr Crane.
I'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. More qualified. Goddamn phony.
...I'm not certain I'll have a career at all, and if I do, I'll probably be a veterinarian.
...Uh-huh.
I do appreciate the interest you've taken, though.
Ah... it's nothing.
I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are?
Huh.
You're an enthusiast.
...I guess I've been all wet.
...I wanted to make you happy.
Birdy--
...No, please.
...You are ze fahzer?
I speak to you on ze phone, non? You have a special interest in music?
Uh-huh.
Ah yes, a music lover.
Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
...Mm.
Ze girl?... She seems like a very nice girl. She *plays*, monsieur, like a very nice girl. Ztinks. Very nice girl. However, ztinks.
I don't understand.
Is not so hard to understand. Her playing, very polite.
Mistake, no, it says E-flat, she plays E-flat. Ping-ping. Hit the right note, always. Very proper.
I don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--I thought you taught the, uh, the--
...she can go up there.
Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert--
A goose, friend. I was chasing a wild goose. Ed, have you ever heard of venture capital?
Uh--
Well, it's the wildest goose there is. Risk money. Very speculative. Except, Ed, in certain situations, it's not, see? I thought I had a prospect here. Well, I make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed--all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. Thank you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! It's only the
That right.
It's called dry cleaning. You heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. It's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. And here's the capper: no shrinkage.
Huh.
...Ed Crane. Remember? Today?
Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.
I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.
...I didn't recognize you without the smock. Did I--damn--did I leave something at the shop?
You got the dough?!
I can get it, yeah.
Come in, come in, siddown over there. Coffee?
No. I--tell me--
Sure.
What's involved, aside from putting up the money? What're you looking for the partner to do?
Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but I'm looking for a silent partner. I've done the research, I've contacted the vendors, the deal is set. I'm just looking for venture capital, friend. Disappear if you want, check in whenever you like--I want the dough; I don't take attendance.
And how do we share--
Fifty-fifty, straight down the line. You and me. Finance and expertise. So--you've got the dough then, do ya?
I'll have it in a week.
...it just goes to show, when one door slams shut, another one opens. Here's to ya, uh...
...Was that a pass?
Maybe.
No problem!
Way out of line.
Right! Strictly business.
...You bring a check?
Cash.
...Usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft. But cash--that's fine--it's all the same in the end-- dough's dough, huh?
Sure.
I got the paperwork here. Partnership papers here, they reflect our agreement: fifty-fifty on the net, I supply professional services, you supply the capital. I'll give you a receipt on the dough there, huh?
Yeah.
Pretty straightforward, but I don't know if you wanna show this stuff to a lawyer--
It's OK.
...Just a second here, I'll give you a receipt on the, uh... Whoa, Nellie... Oh, by the way, we didn't talk about this, I, uh, I think I'm gonna call the place Tolliver's, after me, you know, I didn't think you were much interested in, uh--
That'll be fine.
...Yeah, that's it. As per our discussion.
Well, there it is. Writ large in legal escriture, next step is--
...You're not gonna screw me on this?
*Screw* you--Jesus! Take it to a lawyer! No, I insist! This is *dry* cleaning, this is not some fly-by- night thing here! I must say, I've been an entrepreneur for thirteen years and I've never--
All right.
And I've never been asked--Look, you want the dough back? You know who I am! You--
How ya doin', Ed?
...Were you in the service, Ed?
...That's quite a wife you got there.
Mm.
She's a rare one.
How's business, Dave?
Couldn't be better. These're boom times in retailing. We're opening another store, Big Dave's Annex, there on Garson. This is strictly haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas, ladies' foundations and undergarments. Matter of fact, I'm thinking of making Doris the comptroller. How're things at the, uh, the barbershop?
All right, I guess.
...Say, where do you get those things anyway?
Specialty store down in Sacramento.
...Ed, I...
Uh-huh.
Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, uh, that's not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows.
Uh-huh.
Well, you know what that would do to me.
I guess it would be pretty awkward.
Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store--*her* store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed.
Uh-huh.
I only work here! And the lady's husband would know... Oh, Jesus.
How much to they want, Dave?
$10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is.
...You know... who *who* is?
The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's a businessman from Sacramento. A goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; I heard him out and then told him to go to hell. And the very next day, the very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed for the same amount.
Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--
...Oh, Jesus.
...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?
That's my capitalization on the Annex! *My* operation, Ed! Christ almighty. That's what I was just talking to Doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from Ann.
Mm.
Please, Ed.
But it's...
Your place?
I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself in.
...Dave?
...It ruined me. This money. No annex. I'm all shot to hell.
...What kind of man *are* you?
...Huh?
What kind of man *are* you?
Big Dave--
I'd understand if you'd walked in here. Socked me in the nose. Whatever. I deserved it.
I, uh...
Rye.
Just coffee.
...Doesn't become a matter of public record unless there's foul play. However. I don't believe I'm *prohibited* from telling you this. I guess I'm not obliged to tell you, either. I don't exactly know. But if *I* were the man, I'd want to be told.
Told what?
...Hell, I hope I've done the right thing.
...My first instinct was, no, no, the whole idea was nuts. But maybe that was the instinct that kept me locked up in the barbershop, nose against the exit, afraid to try turning the knob. What if I could get the money?
Honey?
Where you going?
Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I told you last week, for the Christmas Push.
Come on, get ready. It's important.
Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
...What a knucklehead.
Who?
Dave.
How's that?
...Money problems. He's thinking about canceling the Annex.
So?
*That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!*
...What's so damn strange about that?
'Gratulations, Gina. It's so goddamn wonderful.
Congratulations, Gina.
Life is so goddamn wonderful, you almost won't believe it.
Honey...
Honey.
I don't know what's going on. I--
...I don't know what happened to Big Dave. I know some of it. Irregularities in my books, they said. Can I explain it.
You don't have to--
I helped him cook the books, Ed. I did do that.
I know all about that. But I don't know how much to tell them.
Should I... should I tell you why?
...My books used to be perfect. Anyone could open them up, make sense of the whole goddamn store.
Honey...
...Doris--
Look, I don't wanna waste your time so I'll eat while we talk. Ya mind? *You* don't mind. So while I'm in town I'll be staying at the Hotel Metropole, the Turandot Suite. Yeah, it's goofy, the suites're named after operas; room's OK though, I poked around. I'm having 'em hold it for me on account of I'll be back and forth. In addition
No. Of course not. She didn't do it.
Good! That helps. Not that she didn't do it, that she didn't confess. Of course, there's ways to deal with a confession, but that's good!--one less thing to think about. Now. Interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow. You should be there. Three o'clock. One more thing: you keep your mouth shut. I get the lay of the land, I tell *you* what to say. No
...OK.
I knew about it. Big Dave told me about it, and the spot he was putting himself in by getting the money.
...You've gotta give me something to work with. Freddy Riedenschneider is good, but he's not a magician. He can't just wave his little wand in the air and make a plausible defense materialize. Look. Look at what the other side is gonna run at us. They got the company books, prepared by you--*cooked* by you--that's Motive. They got a murder scene *you* had access
It was Big Dave's.
--don't interrupt me--that's Means. They got a fine upstanding pillar of the business community as a victim, and then they got *you*, a disgruntled number-juggling underling who on the day in question was drunk as a skunk and whose alibi for the time in question is being passed out at home, alone.
OK, we forget the blackmail. *You* killed him. How come?
OK, how did you know?
Will anyone else say they knew?
I don't know. I don't think so.
How did you get into the store?
I took Doris's keys.
Will anyone say they saw you there? On your way there? In there? On your was back?
...I don't think so.
...I don't get it.
Look, chum, this is a guy, from what I understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right? Island hopping, practically liberated the Pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of Jap guts between his teeth.
Yeah.
...Did Big Dave mention that it was something about his war service? I don't know, I wasn't there, *you'll* have to tell *us*. Maybe he specified, maybe he didn't; I'm not putting words in your mouth; the point is that this liar, this cynical manipulator, this man who through his lies sneered and belittled the sacrifice and heroism of all our boys who *did*
So... who... who actually--
Not guilty, your honor...
...I gotta hand it to him, he tossed a lot of sand in their eyes. He talked about how I'd lost my place in the universe...
...a puny player on the great world's stage...
...how I was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the D.A. made me out to be, how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel, and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn't had a chance to trot out for Doris...
...who among us is in a position to say...
...and inflame the passions of these twelve fine men and women...
Thanks. Thanks for seeing me, at home.
Oh, hell. Drink?
No thanks.
Sure you don't need one?
I'm fine.
OK. Boy. Jesus!
Yeah. What do I, uh...
'Scuse me, just finished dinner. Um. Frankly, Doris'd be better off with the county defender.
He a good man?
Bert's OK, sure, he's a good man. I won't kid you though, Ed, nobody around here has any experience with this kind of, er... And I hear they're bringing a prosecutor up from Sacramento. Capital offense. Taking it seriously... Hmm...
So--
Taking it seriously.
Coffee, Ed?
I'm fine. Thanks.
...So, uh, who should I--
...Probity.
Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for, uh...
Well, the best, the money-is-no-object best, for a criminal case, any lawyer would tell you Freddy Riedenschneider. Out of Sacramento. 'Course, I don't know how you're fixed for money.
Uh-huh. He's the, uh...
Ed, how're you holding up?
I'm so damn sorry about your loss. Terrible thing. Just damn terrible.
Yeah.
Birdy's in the parlor--I'm on long distance here.
...Huh?
Haven't I seen you up in ladies' wear?
I don't work here. My wife does.
Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?
Yeah.
Check out the rack on that broad in the angora.
...Did you make that up?
That was quite something.
He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.
That was something. I'm Ed Crane.
...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls me Birdy.
Says here that the Russians exploded n A-bomb and there's not a damn thing we can do about it.
Uh-huh.
...Ed?
Huh?
Russians exploded an A-bomb.
Yeah.
Jesus...
...so you tie your own flies, Ed. I mean, if you're really serious. You tie your own flies, you do a--I know it's matickless, I know, people say, hey, you can buy flies at the store-- but you can buy your fish at the store, Ed, you see what I'm saying?
Uh-huh.
The point is there's a certain art to the process. The point is not merely to provide, and let me point out, these fish are not as dumb as you might think.
Uh-huh.
Sportsmanship! That's my point. June fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these? Well, what fish do you seek?
Yeah.
...You sure, Eddie?
Frank.
Huh?
This hair.
Yeah.
...You ever wonder about it?
Whuddya mean?
I don't know... How it keeps on coming. It just keeps growing.
Yeah--lucky for us, huh, pal?
No, I mean it's growing, it's part of us. And we cut it off. And throw it away.
...I'm gonna take his hair and throw it out in the dirt.
What the--
I'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt.
...How you today, Ed?
OK.
You don't got a headache?
...Nah.
This is what family is for, Ed! This is when ya come together!
Yeah.
Close ranks! Goddamnit! Those sons of bitches!
Frank, uh, you know I'll try to contribute, but, uh--Freddy Riedenschneider--
I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together!
That's very generous.
They're just people like you and me, Ed. Remember that.
Uh-huh.
Just people. They gotta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money. This is why the big lobby, Ed. But they put their pants on one leg at a time. Just like you and me.
Uh-huh.
...We goin'?
Huh?
They sent us to tell ya. We pulled the detail.
I don't understand.
Birdy... I didn't mean to--
What'd he say?
'Lo, Ed.
Mr...?
Crane. Ed Crane.
...You're Ed Crane?
Yeah--
Barber, right? I'm Freddy Riedenschneider. Hungry? They tell me the chow's OK here. I made some inquiries.
...I'm Crane.
My name is Diedrickson. County medical examiner.
Hello!
Doesn't bother me.
OK, boys, which of you gets the privilege?
We're just closing, friend.
Oh, happy days! I wish I was doing well enough to turn away business! More power to ya, brother! The public be damned!
Yes, sir.
Could you come with me please?
He's a barber.
Ah.
Second chair.
Not an owner.
No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.
...Look, pal, it's a tough break, but, uh... well damnit, your wife's been pinched.
Yeah, uh, they brung her to the county jail, uh...
Homicide.
...Yeah, it's a tough break.
Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow.
Are you awake?... Is he awake?
Crane? We have to tell you, as soon as you're conscious--is he conscious?
His eyes are open.
Uh... you're under arrest.
As soon as the doctor lets us, we gotta move you. Does he understand that? We're supposed to tell him. Are you conscious?
You'll go to the prison hospital.
What'd he say? Does he understand?
Uh, Vince. Sorry. This won't wait.
It better be good.
There are a couple of kids who were lost yesterday near the site of the murder. Claimed they saw a monster. They're pretty determined to tell you their story. You want to see them?
Manual overrides aren't working. I'm getting nothing, Lieutenant.
There's some kind of animal loose in the museum. Pendergast's alone. He needs help. I want volunteers to go with me.
Beauregard! You scared me half to death.
I'm sorry, sir. You okay?
Someone broke into this room.
Anything missin'?
Looks like the curse is still at work.
Don't know if it'll do any good, Mr. Cuthbert.
Why not?
We all love the museum. I come here myself with my kids. We're trying to work with you.
I'm telling you, something's wrong. I still haven't heard from Pendergast. I think you should call it off.
It's too late now. Guests are arriving. The Mayor's car is pulling up.
I'll go down and speak to him.
You haven't got the authority. Only Pendergast can pull the plug.
Pendergast may be in trouble. Don't you understand? He still hasn't come back. It's been over three hours --
Sweet Jesus!
Get his gun and his walkie talkie, Jonathan. Move.
My office is on the third floor! There's a walk-in safe and a portable phone! We can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help!
I had no idea the Museum had a complete collection of Piranesi's Forum sketches.
If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
If the party goes forward, and that's a big if... I've arranged for a large police presence.
Do they have to wear uniforms?
Yes.
I don't want to scare people.
I got it after I was mugged in the subway last spring.
Where's the walk-in safe?
Behind you.
What's the combination?
Forget it!
Battery's dead. Shit.
That thing won't come after us, right? It's going for bigger game. The group blundering around in the basement. Poor fools.
Hurry up!
For Chrissake, I'll do it. What's the combination?!
To the left twice then five no... sorry... I think it's fifteen... it's been a while...
Fifteen... what's next?
This huge police presence tonight isn't necessary, Lieutenant. You'll just scare people off. I can handle the security behind scenes with this system. It's state of the art.
The cops are non-negotiable, Ippolito. Why don't you just tell me how this space station works.
It's fool proof, basically. I designed this whole thing myself. Every valuable object in the Museum carries a small electronic chip. If anything's moved so much as an inch, we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft.
That's great if you're stopping a burglar. Not our goal here. Are there motion detectors?
In every exhibition room. The museum's divided into five cells. The reception and exhibit are in cell five. We could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four, then seal the perimeter with our fire doors.
That would leave one exit for hundreds of people. You'd be violating every fire regulation on the books. We'll guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells. One more question. I see a big hole. If this entire thing is run by computer, what happens if the power fails?
The whole system is shutting down! We have to get out quickly before the fire doors fall!
What doors?
I told you! They seal off all the cells. They were designed to fall automatically in a system failure --
Ippolito! Get back here!
D'Agosta? Ippolito. Come in.
Where the hell are you?
I made it outside. I'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here. Help is on the way. Just sit tight.
Who are you? The undertaker?
Special Agent Pendergast. FBI.
Vince D'Agosta. Am I out?
The body?
What's left of it.
We need light in here, stat.
Careful. That mess on the ground is brains.
Whose footprints?
An original Roger Tory Peterson of a Red-Breasted Merganser. Amazing. I have a copy of this in my office at home.
Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast. I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down.
In this violent world, I believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things.
I drink. After hours of course. On duty, I smoke. Do you mind?
Not at all. I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
Lieutenant --
Call me Vince.
Did you read about a boat that washed up outside of New Orleans about four months ago? Twelve bodies on board.
Who didn't? Big news. Out of Brazil, wasn't it?
Yes. That's my case. Now it's yours. All the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way. Decapitated. Brains extracted. Limbs torn to shreds. It looked like the work of a large animal, but there was no sign of an animal on board.
So the method of death is the only connection?
If you don't mind, this could be important.
You're kidding.
I've got to admit, that was a damn sight better than "the dog ate my homework".
How do you explain the part about Beauregard?
They heard the victim's name and wove him into their story. Nice touch.
You think what we've got here is a monster as big as a house that smells... like hamburger?
No. I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he's a monster.
What happened to them?
Saliva test? You mean, you think someone ate part of the brain?
I don't like animals. Never have. Dog bit me when I was little. After that I gave up on pets. Animals are irrational. Give me a psychotic killer any day. If there's one thing that makes me queasy it's being part of a food chain. My first case as a rookie, two brothers climbed a fence at the zoo. It was late August. Over
This isn't an animal, Vince. I've been on this case four months, remember? I've learned a few things.
How big is the sub-basement?
Apparently it's huge.
I think I should come with you.
Pendergast! Help! It's right behind us!
Vince? There's no way we can get to you with the fire doors down. There's an entrance to the sub- basement in the hall off the north side exit.
The sub-basement?
I smell it. It's here.
Go out the north exit! There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases. Run!
Nice to see you, Lieutenant.
This place is a maze.
Look. It's some kind of letter.
Did you hear that? My God. He says that Mbwun is real!
Pardon my French, but bull shit.
Shouldn't a drug that powerful be destroyed?
Lieutenant! It's me.
What is it?
Dr. Green has to see you!
Got my hands full here.
What happened?!
It's still back there!
How much ammo do we have to make a stand?
All right. Kawakita, cover the rear.
I believe in you a hundred percent, Vince, but that's the second time we've been at that intersection.
What's that?
What does it say?
Dr. John Whittlesley.
What's that doing here?
Dear God. Where are we, Lieutenant?
We've met. The Hacksaw Murders. '89.
Oh yes! Who could forget. Afterwards you sent me that amazing case of Chateau Lafitte.
I hope you liked it.
What are we talking about here?
Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.
Curious. There's something missing.
The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
Yes. Bit of a shock. But as Cuthbert so tactfully put it, the museum needs new blood. And since I've been here since the Mesozoic Era --
I don't believe it.
Now Margo, don't overreact. Cuthbert has to cut costs somehow. My leaving makes perfect sense. This isn't exactly early retirement. I've overstayed the party a bit.
We can't do without you. You're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology. You're practically an institution around here.
Please. Don't humiliate me further.
Let me help. I can take care of everything.
No, Margo. This is one problem you can't solve. You have to stay out of it. The fact is, I want to retire.
How can you say that? You know it's not true.
Yes it is. I'm tired and I'm no longer needed --
My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.
With all due respect, dear, that's bull. You dance rings around me with your new technology. You've left me in the dust.
Your work is highly relevant. What about your display on Primitive Pharmacology? Cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the Superstition Exhibit.
Come on. I'll walk you back to the elevator.
I'm not giving up.
This isn't a death sentence. Greg has promised to teach me fly fishing. I'll garden. I'll write.
You are this museum. It won't be the same without you.
That Cuthbert. What a piece of work. Someone's dead and all he cares about is his Superstition Exhibit.
I can't help thinking there's something that Pendergast overlooked. If the scratches were made by whatever killed Beauregard, it wants something that's in here.
A blow dart. Seed pods. A plant press. Pretty unimpressive stuff.
What is it?
I'm not sure. As you know, the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct. This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant.
Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui. John used it as packing material.
Margo, these aren't seed pods.
What are they?
Like the claw.
Let's not jump to conclusions. This egg could belong to any number of reptiles, Dr. Frock.
Come on, Margo. We're on the verge of something huge. Let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room. What if John was right. I mean, what if? And he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates. When it got to the museum, it hatched.
Look at this. An ambyloid reovirus protein. That explains why the computer's confused. The plant's infected with a virus.
That's not so unusual. Many plants carry viruses. Like the burls on Maple trees.
All right, assuming the program is accurate, this is a description of the animal with that claw. "Species unidentified. Genus: unidentified. Phylum unknown. Male, weight in excess of 240 kg. Brain capacity, 900 centimeters." That means it's highly intelligent. "Quadrupedal."
"Nocturnal. External hair and bony plates. Locomotor speed 60-70 kilometers. Reduced optic chiasm"... poor eyesight. "External mucoid nasal glands,"... very keen scent... "Morphological characteristics: Highly robust. Aggressiveness: extreme."
So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.
With the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear.
Margo, what you've just described is a killing machine.
And it's hungry. It's been two days since it's eaten. There are five hundred people arriving right now. The animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell! All those people in one enclosed space...
What's going on?
Some kind of power failure. Maybe it's the storm. Do you have a flashlight?
Dr. Frock. Did you hear that?
What's that?
None of that matters now. The people upstairs need us. We have to help.
We can't. We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe. I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements. If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do. The building must be swarming with police by now. It won't take long for them to get through the doors.
I'm coming with you.
Come back and get me.
We will.
Dr. Frock?
Thank you for taking the time to help us with this, Dr. Frock.
Happy to be useful. It's rare enough these days. According to security, Beauregard put the Whittlesley crates in storage area 1012.
How many storage areas are there?
Do you mean Dr. Whittlesley?
Something tried to get into this room!
And failed. These doors are solid steel.
This means there must be an animal loose in the museum!
It's from John. Those two arrows were his insignia. It's addressed to Louis Moriarty, a patron who financed his expeditions.
Read it out loud.
You said John Whittlesley made a study of your blueprints of the museum.
Yes.
Are there any hidden rooms or staircases? Places where someone could hide?
Where is that?
I don't know. It was walled over. No one's been down there in years.
We think it may have something to do with the eggs we found in the crate.
Margo, this is too dangerous. You always think you can solve everything. This time you don't have enough information. The animal might behave in unexpected ways. Leave her here with me. Don't put her in danger.
What's that?
Dr. Frock, I was wondering. What happened to the rest of Whittlesley's plants?
You work here?
Yes, I do.
What do you do?
I'm an Evolutionary Biologist. What do you do?
Nothing. I'm in third grade. What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?
Evolutionary Biologist. I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
Way cool. Then you know where the dinosaurs are.
This room sucks.
She's never going to take us to see the dinosaurs. That lady said they were on the fourth floor.
We're not supposed to go back there.
I don't want to go this way.
Quiet!
What is it?
We were just lost, okay? And we went down this curvy staircase. At the bottom was a big shadow.
Big as a house.
Not that big.
And it snuffled the ground like a dog.
It had a long tongue, teeth this big and yellow eyes.
They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.
They were yellow!
Hard to read in this light. The ink is so faded.
The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast. Maybe we should head back.
They've got something.
Shut them up!
Stop!
Argo! Hobbes!
There's something out there! Let's go get it now! That's why we came down here, isn't it?
Look. It's Hobbes! He's all right.
Come on. Let's get back to the others. We can't leave them alone.
It's alright. I can tell by the way the dog's acting that whatever was out there is gone. What is this place?
Oh... my... God!
Jesus, what is this?
Oh no. I smell it.
If I spent half the time on my Fractal Evolution thesis that I spend on this fly rod, I'd have my PhD.
I have the species identification on these teeth. We can extract DNA and start running tests on the extrapolator program. Call Dr. Frock. He wanted a demonstration.
Margo, you haven't heard?
What?
That's impossible.
For once I'm glad you're rumor central. What in the world is going on?
Mbwun.
What do you make of it, Margo?
Turkish Gecko, I believe. A lizard.
Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand? Impossible. The sample must be contaminated.
What kind of egg is it?
These plant fibers are loaded with hormones!
4-monoxytocin is... "A hormone secreted by the human hypothalamus gland."
This is it. This is what he, or it... is after! The plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain!
So what?
Pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victim's brains!
Eats them?
Is Dr. Frock safe!
Got to finish this thesis sometime.
How about lunch?
Not today. Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.
Special Agent Pendergast. FBI. Forgive me. I guess I was snooping. What is this?
An invention of mine. It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its DNA. I call it the Genetic Sequence Extrapolator.
How does it work?
With a DNA analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal, whether it was nocturnal, what it ate, how it hunted, how big it was... You aren't here for a lesson in DNA.
Somehow, when all this happened... I knew it would come back to John. Is he really dead?
Maybe not.
If he were alive he'd have contacted me.
Dr. Whittlesley was last seen in Belem, Venezuela a week after the rest of his expedition disappeared. A taxi driver drove him to the harbor where he boarded a cargo boat. That boat washed up in my district. Everyone on board was killed.
And John?
Disappeared. His body wasn't among the victims.
I don't understand.
John couldn't have anything to do with a horrible thing like that. He was a fine man despite his problems --
You loved him.
Yes. Once. We met at Columbia. John held the Cadwalader Chair in Statistical Paleontology when I was a grad student there.
You were going to be married.
How did you know that?
I ran an internet search on Dr. Whittlesley. Got a list of his scholarly articles and the engagement announcement in the Times. I also found a record of your restraining order.
That was two years ago. John was still in love with me. He wouldn't leave me alone.
You were afraid of him, weren't you?
He was afraid of himself. He tried suicide once. He was ill. Manic depressive. He had wild emotional highs and lows. Not a happy affliction for a scientist. He'd been revered in our community. By the end he was a joke.
Tell me about the last expedition. What was he looking for?
A legendary monster called Mbwun.
A monster?
Yes. He developed his own theory that he called the Calisto Effect. It held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection. The environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a "monster species". It made no sense. But he felt he had evidence that Mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands
What happened?
No. I'm all right. I won't let this affect me anymore. John wouldn't get help. His ego endangered the lives of others. His theory came first.
What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there? Was he desperate enough to create one?
I don't understand.
Something came up in autopsy tonight. Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw.
My God. Then it was an animal.
I don't think so. I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun. Did Whittlesley's monster have claws?
I don't know. He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation. But I've never seen it. It's in the exhibit.
Where would we find it?
I'm not sure. We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one.
What happened?
I don't know.
I heard you calling and I ran after you, but you kept disappearing and I couldn't keep up.
It's okay, I'm all right. I remember now... It was an animal. Something large! I could smell it. It was hunting me. I saw two green eyes in the dark.
Where did you see it?
That's not what I saw.
Dr. Green...
I didn't imagine it. I know what I saw. Are you sure there are enough men in there?
They're all heavily armed.
All right. This is hard for me. I'm a scientist. I like order and logic. Sometimes too much. There's got to be an explanation. There can't be an animal in there. But I saw something.
What was it?
Genetic damage?
When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair. Viruses can damage DNA. So can radiation, certain chemicals. Even cancer. Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out. I have to get started. This will take several hours.
Pendergast? Are you all right?
You're not. Where is it?
Gone.
Wounded?
No. A chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball. I think it was bothered by my light.
I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish. Like nothing I ever saw. I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that.
It's not supernatural. Mbwun is an animal. Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
But what can we do? Our guns are useless --
You'd slow us down and put Margo in danger.
That was D'Agosta.
The planetarium!
Is there another way around?
Hide quickly!
What is it doing?
What happened?
Its eyesight is worse than I thought. It couldn't see us. And it couldn't smell us through the glass.
It didn't want the fibers. What does that mean?
I think... it means it's full.
Then it won't go after the others?
No. It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.
For what?
We have to try and draw it off!
How?
That's a ptarmigan, feigning a broken wing. The bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest!
Help someone!
You smell that?
We're not going to make the storage room!
No! Don't kill him! Pendergast, you were right. It's John!
What?
I don't believe it.
You have to! Listen! All viruses pass on their own DNA. Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses! This one was different. It inserted a whole array of genes into John. Reptile genes, sixty five million years old. Those genes remade him! It's not his fault!
Just like John. He won't listen.
I have to shoot.
He has to look here or I won't get a clear shot. Call him, Margo.
I can't!
I'm so glad to see you. What's the occasion?
I'm sorry to keep you. How can I help?
I want to book a flight to Fiji.
Where exactly?
<i>Fiji.</i>
<i>Where</i> in Fiji? What island?
I'm sorry, er...the biggest one.
Viti Levu. For how many?
One.
When do you want to leave, remembering, of course, you do lose a day on the way there?
Today.
I'm sorry. I don't have anything for at least a month.
<i>A month.</i>
It's the busy season.
You are a travel agent, aren't you? "Doris"? Your job is to help people travel.
I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for Fiji tomorrow. But you wouldn't want to do that.
Why wouldn't I?
I thought you were in a hurry.
That's right.
You want to book the flight?
Close up?
Why is he in the basement?
He moved down there after Meryl packed up and left.
Why wasn't I told? Any unpredictable behavior has to be reported. Is that the best shot we can get?
What's to see?
What happened down there?
Give me a shot from Truman's ring.
We've declared a curfew. Everyone else is at first positions.
All prop cars accounted for?
I'm sure we'll get him on this next sweep.
What have we missed?
We're not watching the sea.
Why would we--
Cue music...
What music?
He doesn't care.
Welcome.
Thank you.
The catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course Truman's father, Kirk, and his infiltration onto the show. Before we discuss that, it's worth reminding viewers that this isn't the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach Truman.
Of course, there hasn't been anything to compare with this - the first time an intruder has been a former cast member--
--a dead one at that.
--and certainly the first time that an intruder has been rewarded with a starring role. I really must congratulate you on writing Kirk back in. A master stroke.
Since Kirk started this whole crisis in Truman's life, I came to the conclusion that he was the only one who could end it.
I understand he's hardly had a life of his own since he left the show. How did you convince him--was it the opportunity to be close to Truman again?
That and a fat, new contract.
How <i>do</i> you intend to explain his twenty- two year absence?
Amnesia.
Let's talk ratings. "Truman" has always enjoyed top ten status but the huge surge over the last few days--how do you hope to sustain that audience now that Truman appears to have reconciled himself?
As you know ratings have never been our primary goal. I imagine we'll lose those voyeurs only interested in witnessing Truman's latest torment. However, I'm certain that our core audience will remain loyal.
But recent events have been so dramatic, it does raise the perennial question. What keeps us watching this one man twenty-four hours a day - eating, sleeping, working, sitting for hours in contemplation?
We've become tired of watching actors give us phony emotions, bored with pyrotechnics and special effects. While the world he inhabits is counterfeit, there's nothing fake about Truman himself. No scripts, no cue cards. It's not always Shakespeare but it's genuine. That's how he can support an entire channel.
A window onto the human condition?
Not only does he give us a glimpse of the truth, he gives us a glimpse of ourselves.
But how do you account for the popularity of those eight hours a day when Truman sleeps?
We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort. Haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep?
Are we talking Emmies?
Certainly a nomination.
Of course, Truman has always been very much in on casting.
As with our own lives, the only people he can't cast are his family. Otherwise he has final approval, able to elevate an extra into a lead role as was the case with his only real friend, Marlon, or alternatively relegate a star to a bit player.
We should remind viewers that Truman, especially as a child, presented a challenge for the production.
He was curious from birth - premature by two weeks, as if he couldn't wait to get started.
Of course, his eagerness to leave his mother's womb also meant he was the one selected.
In competition with five other unwanted pregnancies - the casting of a show determined by an air date - he was the one who arrived on cue.
Who knew that a show originally meant to last one year - "Bringing Up Baby" - would turn into a "cradle to grave" concept. He is in fact the first child in the world to be legally adopted by a corporation.
That's correct.
And the show now generates a yearly income equivalent to the gross national product of a small country.
People forget it takes the <i>population</i> of an entire country to keep the show running.
No, of course not. And since the show runs 24 hours a day with no commercial breaks the staggering profits are all generated from product placement.
Yes, everything you see on the show is for sale - from the actors' wardrobe, food products, to the very homes they live in--
All products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value.
There's nothing on the show I don't use myself.
Why do you feel that Truman's never come close to discovering the true nature of his world?
You've never actually met Truman, yourself. Never thought about doing a cameo--playing a veterinarian, or a priest, something like that?
I've been tempted. But I think it's important to retain objectivity. I wouldn't want to get emotionally caught up.
We've learnt about life as Truman has and, despite the complaints of a minority, it's been an overwhelmingly positive experience, for Truman and for the viewing public.
Who are you?
The creator of what?
A show - that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.
<i>A show.</i> Then who am I?
Nothing was real.
I have a map.
Truman, I've watched you your whole life. I saw you take your first step, your first word, your first kiss. I know you better than you know yourself. You're not going to walk out that door--
What's he doing?
They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.
The memory of who?
But why didn't he just follow her to Fiji?
Because his mother got sick - very sick. He couldn't leave her. He's a kind boy, maybe too kind.
How can they have a child?
It's not gonna be his, you idiot.
Why not?
You think she'd go through with it?
Sure she would.
You take Japanese.
Oh, yes.
Lauren, right?
That's right. Lauren.
I'm Truman, Truman Burbank--
It's okay. I probably wouldn't talk to me either.
I'm sorry. It's not up to me.
No...I, er.
No? Really? Good, I mean, I thought possibly a pizza. How about Friday?
No.
Actually, I'm free Sunday.
Now.
Right now? We've got finals tomorrow.
Well, what do you want to do?
It's beautiful! What are you waiting for?
I'm thinking of getting out, Marlon.
Yeah? Outta what?
See here, this is us. All the way round here, Fiji. You can't get any further away before you start coming back. Y'know, there are still islands in Fiji where no human has ever set foot.
So when are you leaving?
It's not that simple. Takes money, planning. You can't just up and go. Oh, I'm going to do it, don't worry about that. I've just got to move slow. Pick my moment. Bonus time's just around the corner. Soon as I finish the...
Nursery?
Truman, you know, I did think about moving away one time.
Yeah, what happened?
I figured, what's the point? I knew I'd just be taking my problems with me. Once the kids came along, it made me look at Seahaven with new eyes. I realized, what the hell could be better than this? I'm telling you. What you really need is someone to carry on the "Burbank" name.
You think so?
You really think it could've dropped off an airliner?
Sure. It's halogen. Shame it didn't hit you - you could've sued. You coming for a drink?
Marlon--
I've got to talk to you.
Sorry, I'm way behind.
I'm onto something, Marlon - something big.
Are you okay? You look like shit.
I think I'm mixed up in something.
<i>Mixed up?</i> Mixed up in what?
There's no point in trying to explain it, but a lot of strange things have been happening - elevators that don't go anywhere, people talking about me on the radio, you know what I mean?
No. Truman, if this is another one of your fantasies...
I think it's got something to do with my dad.
Your Dad?!
I think he's alive. I'll tell you about it later. I'm definitely being followed.
Who?
It's hard to tell. They look just like regular people.
How about them?
Could be. Beard looks phony. It's when I'm unpredictable. They can't stand that. That's why we've got to get out of here. Can you come with me?
I told you I can't.
What're we doing here, Truman?
This is where it started.
What exactly?
Things. Things that doesn't fit. Maybe I'm being set up for something. You ever feel like that, Marlon? Like your whole life has been building to something?
No.
When you were hauling chickens for Kaiser Poultry, what was the furthest you ever went off the island?
I went all over but I never found a place like this. Look at that sunset, Truman. It's perfect.
Yeah...
That's the "Big Guy". Quite a paintbrush he's got.
Just between you and me, Marlon, I'm going away for a while.
Stay where you are!
I don't know what to think, Marlon. Maybe I'm going out of my mind, but I get the feeling that the world revolves around me somehow.
It's a lot of world for one man. You sure that's not wishful thinking, you wishing you'd made something more of yourself? Christ, Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had an imaginary interview on "Seahaven Tonight"? Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?
And the last thing I'd ever do is lie to you. Think about it, Truman, if everybody's in on it, I'd have to be in on it too. I'm not in on it, because there is no <i>it.</i>
So what are you saying, Marlon, the whole thing has been in my head--?
Not the whole thing, Truman. You were right about one thing.
What's that?
...personally I think the unconquered south face is the only one worth scaling...of course it's a 20,000 foot sheer wall of ice but then when did that ever stop me before?...Naturally, I intend to make the ascent without the benefit of oxygen but also without crampons or even an ice pick...<i>risks?</i>... ...sure I'm aware of the risks--why else do you think I would spend
What's that?
Well, what do you think?
Hi, honey. Look at this. It's a "Chef's-Mate." Dicer, slicer and peeler in one. Never needs sharpening. Dishwasher safe.
How did it go today?
I was hoping we could have a special evening.
I won't be late.
Where have you been?
I've been thinking--
Oh, God.
--I figure we could scrape together eight thousand.
Every time you and Marlon--
--We could bum around the world for a year on that.
And then what, Truman? We'd be back to where we were five years ago. You're talking like a teenager.
Maybe I feel like a teenager.
It'd be an adventure.
I thought we were going to try for a baby. Isn't that enough of an adventure?
This'll pass. Everybody thinks like this now and then. Come to bed.
What're you doing down here?
Fixing the mower. I saw my father today.
I know.
How do you know?
What did you want?
I made macaroni.
Come on, Truman. Haven't you studied enough?
I'll take you home, Angela. Why don't you leave those with us for a while?
Good night, Mother.
I have to talk with you. But not here. Let's go for a walk.
I'm sorry, I'm late.
What's the hurry?
Arrah!
Oh, my God!
What do I do?
I don't know--
--you're a nurse, aren't you?
I invited Marlon and Rita for a barbeque Sunday. I thought I'd make my potato salad. Remind me--
I won't be here Sunday.
--we need more charcoal.
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?
Let's go now.
Where shall we go? Where shall we go? Spontaneity is what it's all about. Forget Fiji. We can't very well drive to Fiji, can we? What about Atlantic City?
You hate gambling.
That's right. I do, don't I?
So why do you want to go?
Because I never have. That's why you go places, isn't it?
Blocked at every turn. Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?
You blaming me for the traffic?
Truman, that was our house!
I've changed my mind again. What's New Orleans like this time of year? Mardi Gras. Or let's just see where the road takes us.
Let me out, Truman. You're not right in the head. You want to destroy yourself, you do it on your own!
It's hard to go places, isn't it?
There's been an accident, Truman.
Truman, I took the "hypocrite" oath!
Truman, what about that sign?
So what do we do for money when we get to New Orleans?
I've got my Seahaven Bankcard.
Let me get you some help, Truman. You're not well.
Why do you want to have a child with me? You can't stand me.
Why don't I make you some of this new Mococoa Drink? All natural. Cocoa beans from the upper slopes of Mount Nicaragua. No artificial sweeteners--
--What the hell are you talking about?!
What the hell has that got to do with anything? Tell me what's happening?!
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
Stop this now. I'll do it. I swear.
Who were you talking to?!
You're the one talking to the walls!
No. You said, "Do something." Who were you talking to? Tell me!
--What are my plans now? Well, next I'm thinking of tackling the Yuba River in an authentic canoe from the Algonquin tribe. --I'm talking about the north fork, a class five rapid - only I'm not going <i>down</i> the Yuba, I'm going <i>up.</i> Do you honestly think for one minute I'd go back to some dreary office to rubber stamp meaningless documents...do you?
How are you, Mother?
Well, I made it through another night.
How's your hip?
You know surprises aren't good for me. You should really call before you come over, dear.
You look very pale, Truman. Are you taking your vitamin D's?
I spend half my life out in the sun, Mother, why would I need vitamin D?
It doesn't sound insane, Truman. I swear I see him ten times a week--in a hundred faces. I almost hugged a perfect stranger in the salon last Thursday.
It was Dad, I swear, dressed like a homeless man. And you know what else was really strange? A businessman and a woman with a little dog appeared from nowhere and forced him onto a bus.
About time they started cleaning up the trash Downtown. We don't want to end up like the rest of the country.
They never found Dad's body--maybe somehow--
--Darling--
I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin. Did Dad have a brother?
We ought to be getting you back, Mother.
Hold on a minute, dear. Here's us at Mount Rushmore. You remember, Truman--when Dad was still with us - that was quite a drive. You slept all the way there.
It looks so small.
I'm looking for my wife--Nurse Burbank. It's important.
I'm afraid that's impossible--she's in pre-op.
Sure. Okay. Fine. Can you pass on a message?
I'll try.
Tell her, tell her...I had to go to Fiji. I'll call her when I get there.
When you get to Fiji?
You got it.
Now what?
Leak at the plant. They had to shut her down.
Is there any way around?
The whole area's being evacuated.
Well, thank you for your help.
They're coming. Any minute.
Who?
They're going to stop me talking to you.
There's no one here.
Just listen. You remember when you were a little boy, you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like Magellan--
--How do you know about that?
--And your teacher said, "You're too late, Truman. There's nothing left to explore."
Were you there--how do you know?
--It doesn't matter. Everybody knows about it. They know everything you do. The point is, you got scared.
I don't understand.
How's it going, Truman?
Not bad. I just won the State Lottery.
Good. Good.
Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?
See you tomorrow, Truman.
Do you live around here?
Not supposed to talk about it.
I think you better tell us.
We don't even know you.
Well, we're FBI agents.
Poopy day?
Yup.
What do you do?
I think that about does it, Spooky.
Does what?
Why don't you go home to the old lady --
What am I doing here?
You were shot in the head. The bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate.
They gave you a craniotomy to relieve the pressure from a subdural hematoma. But you've been unconscious since they brought you in.
Scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting --
You called 911. Except the call was intercepted.
I need your clothes, Byers.
Special Agent Scully --
I apologize for making you wait -- I've brought some new evidence with me --
You've been back to Dallas?
Yes.
Are you going to let us in on what exactly you're trying to prove --
That the bombing in Dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen, so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn't have to be explained --
-- those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully --
And you have conclusive evidence of this? Something to tie this claim of yours to the crime --
I hope to. We're working to develop this evidence --
Working with?
What is it you find incredible?
Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.
No, they don't.
You've got something to show me.
We brought the atmosphere back down to freezing in order to control the development, which is nothing like we've ever seen.
Brought on by what?
This man's still alive.
How can this be?
Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates?
No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
And if it's unsuccessful?
Incinerate it. Like the others.
This man's family will want to see the body laid to rest.
Tell them he was trying to save the young boy's life, and that he died heroically like the other firemen.
Of what?
Yes.
We have a situation. The members are assembling.
Who called this meeting?
Its effect on the host has changed. The virus no longer just invades the brain as a controlling organism. It's developed a way to modify the host body.
My lateness may have well been absence. A course has already been taken.
Do they know?
Mulder was in Dallas when we were trying to dispose of evidence. He's gone back there again. Someone has tipped him.
Who?
Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?
You got some kind of business with him?
I'm looking for him.
Feds are looking for him, too. Real nice business he's got, huh?
What's that?
You looking for him for some other reason?
You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?
I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary. Maybe something from the FEMA offices where the bodies were found.
We weren't expecting to find those remains, of course. They went right off to Washington.
Was there anything in those offices that didn't go to D.C.?
Some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. We thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town.
Have you examined them?
You said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found.
How's that?
Do I know you?
You follow me out here for a reason?
My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil.
I know the name. Why?
How'd you find me?
Heard you come here now and again. Figured you'd be needing a little drinky tonight.
You a reporter?
I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned that. OB-GYN.
Who sent you?
I came on my own. After reading about the bombing in Dallas.
And what's that?
S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.
He just let it explode.
What's the question nobody's asking? Why that building? Why not the Federal Building?
The Federal Building was too well guarded.
Those people were already dead.
Before the bomb went off?
Michaud was a twenty-two year veteran of the bureau --
Michaud was a patriot. The men he's loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldn't predict.
You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...?
I think you're full of shit.
See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you.
Not according to the men in blue.
What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states.
They want to discredit you -- for what?
For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the truth.
You mean that apocalyptic trash you write? I knew your name was familiar. I just didn't know why.
You know my work?
Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --
I was right about Dallas. Wasn't I, Agent Mulder?
How?
I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper.
You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?
According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?
It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago.
And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that. What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas?
What was it?
When we were young men in the military, your father and I were recruited for a project. They told us it was biological warfare. A virus. There were rumors about its origins.
What killed those men?
What killed them I won't even write about. I tell you, they'd do more than just harass me. They have the future to protect.
I'll know soon enough.
What killed those men can't be identified in simple medical terms. My god, we can't even wrap our minds around something as obvious as HIV. We have no context for what killed those men, or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future. Of how it will be transmitted; of the environmental factors involved.
A plague?
The plague to end all plagues, Agent Mulder. A silent weapon for a quiet war. The systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure. They've been working on this for fifty years. While the rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been secretly negotiating a planned Armageddon.
Negotiating with whom?
I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent
And they tell me I'm paranoid.
How can I reach you?
You found something?
Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks.
What?
I'm not sure. A virus --
-- You saw this experiment?
What do you think?
A transportation system. Transgenic crops. The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus.
That would be my guess.
You told me you had answers.
Yeah, well I don't have them all.
You've been using me --
I've been using you?!
You didn't know my father --
I told you -- he and I were old friends --
You'd be shit out of luck if not for me. You saw what you saw because I led you to it. I'm putting my ass on the line for you.
Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters.
Mulder -- it's me --
Where are you, Scully?
I'm on the roof.
Did you find something?
No. I haven't.
What's wrong, Scully?
I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here.
You're looking for a bomb.
I know that. But the threat was called in for the Federal Building across the street.
I think they have that covered.
Mulder...?
Jesus, Mulder...
I know you're bored in this assignment, but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now.
How's that?
You've got to quit looking for what isn't there. They've closed the X-Files. There's procedure to be followed here. Protocol.
Now what?
Had you.
No you didn't.
I saw your face, Mulder. There was a moment of panic.
Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?
Alright... what'll it be: Coke, Pepsi? A saline IV?
Scully...
Scully, I found the bomb.
Where are you, Mulder?
Scully, get somebody to open this door.
Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.
...thirteen fifty six...
Scully?
Something's not right...
Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.
All I told them was the truth.
They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.
What? What are you talking about?
I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
Why?
I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
They were the ones that put us together.
Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that.
This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.
They're not doing this, Mulder. I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to
You're... quitting?
I wake you?
No.
Are you drunk, Mulder?
I was until about an hour ago.
What are you implying, Scully?
I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting.
Go home, Mulder. It's late.
Get dressed, Scully.
Mulder -- what are you doing?
This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas?
According to this tag.
It's like jelly.
And there's been no autopsy performed. There's no Y incision here; no internal exam.
You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.
You knew this man didn't die at the bomb site before we got here.
I'd been told as much.
You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?
I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced.
Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here. I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.
Why are you whispering?
I can't really talk right now.
What did you find?
Evidence of a massive infection.
What kind of infection?
I don't know.
Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too.
Mulder --
I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.
I've got a hearing tomorrow --
-- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.
You said you weren't coming?
I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.
What did you find?
Something I couldn't show to anyone else. Not without more information. And not without causing the kind of attention I'd just as soon avoid right now. The virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat I've never seen before. What it did to them it did extremely fast. And unlike the AIDS virus or any other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely
How was it contracted?
He didn't mention a park.
This is where he marked on the map, Scully. Where he says those fossils were unearthed.
You're sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman's body in the morgue?
The bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it.
And you've never seen anything like that?
This looks like new grass to you?
Ground's dry about an inch down. Somebody just laid this down. Very recently, I'd say.
All the equipment is brand new.
Unmarked tanker trucks... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks?
I don't know, Mulder.
And where are they going with it?
What are my choices?
About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
Where would they be going?
You think they went left?
Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?
What?
I've got to be in Washington D.C. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. And here I am standing out in the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.
We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --
-- of what exactly?!
That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.
They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.
Yeah, well they may this one.
What do you mean by haul? What are you not telling me here?
This virus -- it...
Mulder --
It may be extraterrestrial.
I don't believe this. I don't fucking believe this. Y'know, I've been here... I've been here one too many times with you, Mulder.
Been where?
What do you think it is?
This is weird, Mulder.
Very weird.
Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?
Cool in here. Temperature's being regulated.
You hear that?
I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.
Scully....?
Yeah...?
What are you doing?
Where'd they go?
What? What's wrong?
I already gave Skinner my letter of resignation.
You can't quit, Scully.
I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because I knew --
We're close to something here -- we're on the verge --
You're on the verge, Mulder -- please don't do this to me --
After what you saw last night -- after all you've seen -- you can't just walk away --
I have. I did. It's done.
Just like that --
I'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers --
I need you on this, Scully --
Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.
What? What happened?
Scully...
...my pulse feels thready and I've got a funny taste in the back of my throat.
I think you're in anaphylactic shock --
Scully --
Cold...
We've got to keep moving.
Where are we?
I can't go any farther.
We're going to the morgue.
That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.
On whose orders?
General McAddie is who requested our coming here. We were awakened at three AM and told to get down here immediately.
I don't know anything about that.
Well, call General McAddie.
I don't have his number.
Why don't you go on ahead head and I'll confirm authorization.
Sit down, they're still talking to Agent Scully.
About what?
-- They're asking her for a narrative. They want to know why she was in the wrong building.
You don't see what's going on here, do you? There's four hundred million dollars in damage to the city of Dallas. Lives have been lost. No suspects have been named. So the story being shaped is this could have been prevented. That the FBI didn't do its job.
And they want to blame us?
Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
-- if it looks bad, it's bad for the FBI --
-- if they want someone to blame, they can blame me. Agent Scully doesn't deserve this.
She's in there right now saying the same thing about you.
I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
Agent Mulder --
She's missing. We've been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in.
Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
I know. Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas.
How deep does this go?
Are we being watched?
What are you doing?
Mr. Mulder.
What happened to Kurtzweil?
Where's Scully?
I have answers for you.
Is she alive?
I'm quite prepared to tell you everything, though there isn't much you haven't guessed.
About the conspiracy?
I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.
What is it?
A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully has been infected with. It must be administered with ninety six hours.
You're lying.
No. Though I have no way to prove otherwise. The virus is extraterrestrial. We know very little about it, except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet.
A virus?
A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks.
This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?
Aids, the ebola virus -- on the evolutionary scale they are newborns. This virus walked the planet long before the dinosaurs.
What do you mean, walked?
Until Dallas, we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism. That mass infection would make us a slave race.
That's why you bombed the building. The infected firemen, the boy --
But... he sacrificed his own daughter. My sister, Samantha.
Why are you telling me this?
I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.
What happened to Kurtzweil?
As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future.
Where is he?
Let me out. Stop the car.
You have precious little time. What I've given you the alien colonists have no idea exists. You hold in your hand the power to end the project.
How?
The vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus. Its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we've so assiduously protected for the last fifty years. Or it may not.
What alien environment?
Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her science can save the future.
What about you?
We began to worry. Some of us have traveled so far, and you are the last to arrive.
More concerns than that?
My god...
The geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us. About our place in their Colonization.
We're going to tell them what we've found. What we've learned. Turn over a body infected with the gestating organism.
In hope of what? Learning that it's true?! That we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms?!
Let me remind you who is the new race. And who is the old. What could be gained by withholding anything from them; By pretending to ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. To start Colonization early.
And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.
Our vaccine may have no effect!
We've allowed this man his freedom. His books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial. Has he outlived his usefulness to us?
No one believes Kurtzweil or his books. He's a toiler. A crank.
You can't kill Mulder. He's got too much light on him.
You need not kill a man to destroy him.
Sing a song of sixpence...
A pocketful of rye...
Did we go sailing?
Almost. Mocky-Lock showed up.
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
He hates me.
She adores you.
She thinks I can bring Edward back.
We've been over this a dozen times. No.
Why not? Just once. A trial run. What harm could it do?
Miriam...
He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.
I've heard this argument before. It's not happening.
It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.
If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him. Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.
I do it all the time!
Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...
I'd be there for him.
And he might blame you for terrifying him. That one moment could erase all you've accomplished. And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone.
You're sure? Any more nightmares?
No.
Good. We need you healthy and relaxed. You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television.
Yes mother.
Don't bring it home in this.
Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese place he's wild about. Want to come?
I've got to feed my cat. Besides, I want to get to bed early.
Sing a song of sixpence.
A pocketful of fucking rye. What's wrong?
Nothing.
The first... What? Six or seven times I went in. Remember what happened?
Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.
Like a New Year's Day hangover.
This isn't your responsibility. Remember that. Don't let them use guilt as a tool. If you want to stop, say so.
I'll be fine.
Catherine? I'm about to start. If you want me to wait, or...
Is it cold in here?
...a pocketful of rye.
Four and twenty blackbirds...
Damn him.
What's wrong?
I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan...
I don't need them anymore...
I'll come by tomorrow after work. With dinner.
Thanks Miriam. Say hi to Henry and...
...give a kiss to Edward.
What if he wasn't like this? What if he was "normal?" Conscious. How far would you go?
There's always a chance they'll confess.
Really? I don't work with violent cases, I work with children. But even a kid lies. They love it when they get you to believe something that isn't true. Don't you think Stargher would do the same?
Sometimes... Once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure. They have so much they want to tell. But they've never had a sympathetic ear. They need someone to understand why. Stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully. It was part of the ritual. Some weren't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean. But these last three...
I still don't understand why I can't do this... This isn't some "troubled kid" you're dealing with.
I realize that...
This man is deeply disturbed, he...
You don't know the procedure.
Edward Baines, I presume. Hi, Ed. I'm Pete.
Do you think that's funny?
I read about a woman in TExas who was in a coma for seven years. Every time her husband came to visit, her heart would beat faster. Isn't that something? I don't know what name scientists have for something like that...
It doesn't have much to do with science.
What then?
The soul. The spirit. Whatever you want to call it.
Agent Novak?
Peter, okay?
Absolutely. I suppose everyone does.
Just like we all have fantasies, right? Things only we know, that we don't share.
With Stargher I saw things...
What did you see?
Why'd you bring him here?
You're the shrink, you tell me.
You thought Stargher wanted to be caught.
I did, yeah.
What about Julia?
This is going to sound terrible, but... I don't think she matters anymore. Not to him. He never finished her. The others...he was able to make them his.
You think you can do this, don't you?
He might tell me about Julia. The part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse. Who wants to be redeemed.
This is Stargher we're talking about?
Not Stargher, not really. He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster. And an innocent child. If I could reach the boy.
Whoa. Hold on. Aren't they the same guy?
Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality? Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act. We're all human.
It's hard for me to see Stargher as human, capable of something like "remorse."
Then what is he?
Evil.
If you believe that.
Maybe this is a big fucking waste of time.
What happened?
What difference does it make...?
A child can experience abuse worse than Charlie's. And grow up to be someone who would never, ever hurt another living thing.
You're sure of that?
Remember, Julia Hickson is priority number one. Nothing else matters. Find out where she is.
Wait...
He wants us to follow. The little boy...
Little boy?! That's him!
Where the hell are we?
COME ON!
That went well.
You sure about this?
I heard Julia and John got married.
Yep. Eloped.
Well look at that.
I told you. You have to be optimistic. Believe in them...
He's mine?
He also says that until proven differently, Julia Hickson was found as a result of good old-fashioned detective work.
It doesn't matter...
They're hungry.
Thank you.
No problem.
You liked him?
What now?
Who says?
Mocky-Lock.
Oh no... No you don't.
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman. Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
She the one from Santa Cruz?
Agent Cole.
I need you to find something in the basement...
Already there.
Lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named Bainbridge who tired to build a machine works out near Delano. Bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court and the state winds up with the land - it's just sitting there.
Delano?
Yep. And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
You're kidding me.
Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?
Not a gift. A highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex, that's all. A genetic fluke.
Intravenous administration complete.
That's why we monitor the use of the drugs so closely. We don't want her getting to that degree of perceptual disorientation.
I hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this.
She changed the codes.
What's wrong?
Instead of going into his mind...
When did he lapse into the coma?
What about the legalities of this...?
Catherine!
When we got here, you just topped and pulled her out.
Into Stargher. Inside...
I have done this, you know. Been inside.
Nervous?
I have to ask you some things... Are you taking any prescription drugs?
Prevacid. For my stomach.
Any psychiatric medication?
No.
What about narcotics?
No.
I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
I am. I'm a pretty boring guy.
Is she alright?
Agent Novak.
Dr. Kent.
You're looking well.
Thanks you. Six weeks off does a body good. I heard she got the approval to try the reversal with Edward.
That's a secret.
How's the patient.
Awaiting his arrival.
What about the cat?
Someone looking after her little girl?
So?
I need it.
Now?
The dog's an albino. He'd love an animal like that.
The Phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago. And we got the match.
How is she?
Here he is.
Breeders typically destroy albino pups, so this animal is truly unique.
After three years she remembers what the guy drove?
We proceed assuming she is.
Let's give old Carl a call. Tell him he's got company.
We'll go back to his house, Pete. There's still a lot to do. Analyze the videos, track sales of the bleach, go through his records. Maybe he owns property somewhere.
You sure you want to go through with this?
What else do we do?!
I don't know, Pete, but for god's sake... This is nuts. Do you really understand what they're going to do?
I don't have to.
Why jeopardize what we've already done? We caught the sonofabitch. Carl Stargher. That's going to be like Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer. A case that makes careers. But if we push our luck. If this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it.
Tell you what. If this thing burns us, I take that heat. I give you permission to point your finger at me and say "It was all his idea."
Right here.
Next time, tell me, okay?
Jesus Christ, man, you look like hell.
You're bettin' the farm on something you saw after they pumped you full of god knows-what kind of shit?
I saw her. Julia. Alive. I saw everything.
Ich weiss nicht.
Den leuten.
Ja, ja, ja.
Hier sind fruher Fursten ans unt eingeganger. Hier hat sogar ein Metternich verkehrt...
Give her some cigarettes.
Warscheinlich ist der murder.
Thank you.
Sit down.
You were awfully good.
Do you understand German?
But I could follow it fine. Perhaps Harry told you about me. My name's Holly Martins.
Well, I saw you at the funeral.
I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
You were in love with him, weren't you?
Oh, American, thank you. I like them.
No.
He has a little dog.
Don't understand what Harry saw in a fellow like that.
He said he remembered me too. Seems to show he wasn't in much pain.
Dr. Winkel told me that.
Dr. Winkel? Who is he?
The doctor Harry used to go to. He was passing just after it happened.
His own doctor?
Yes.
Yes. They said it wasn't the driver's fault. Harry often said what a careful driver he was.
He was Harry's driver?
...at all.
I don't know. They didn't answer.
You shouldn't get mixed up in this.
Well, if I do find out something, can I look you up again?
What's she talking about?
Anything really wrong with your papers?
They're forged.
Why?
Oh, what was the name of that doctor? Harry's doctor?
Drink?
Harry?
Who are you looking for now?
Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.
The Porter is going to talk to us tonight.
Might as well I suppose. Are you busy?
Can I hear you?
In German?
I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?
Do I...
Gestern bein heurigen...
What's that?
H-E-Z-T...
Tell me about him.
When...what did you do?
...to steal my girl.
Oh, that was many years ago.
Tell me more.
...and buried him.
Seemed like a good idea.
It's just what he used to say.
Well, I didn't learn that from him.
If we have to see the Porter we'd better go.
What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?
I thought you wanted...
A moment ago you said you didn't want to see the Porter.
We're both in it, Harry.
Holly.
I'm so sorry.
That's Harry's place, isn't it?
Let's go away.
What's the matter?
Let's not get into any more trouble.
Sneak out the other way, and go back to your theatre. I'd better not see you again.
What are you going to do?
I wish I knew.
Wer ist da?
I thought you were going to go away. Aren't the police after you?
I'm going back home.
What happened to your hand?
A parrot...Let it go.
Have you seen Calloway?
Can you imagine a parrot nipping a man?
...you know.
He's better dead. I know he was mixed up - but not like that.
I knew him for twenty years - at least I thought I knew him. I suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time.
He liked to laugh.
Seventy pounds a tube. He wanted me to write for his great medical charity.
...and my lover. He was Harry.
...again.
Are you going, too?
...is there?
...Headquarters.
Harry.
What is on your mind? Why did you hide?
Here, it will be cold on that train.
I shall be all right.
What is going to happen? Where is Harry?
He's safe in the Russian zone.
How do you know?
Did he say anything about me - tell me?
Oh, the usual things...
Of course I didn't tell Calloway.
That's his headache.
His.
Oh, well.
Why are you lying?
...quarrel?
...anyway?
Good evening, Miss Schmidt. You remember me?
Of course.
Cigarette, Miss Schmidt?
Thank you.
Nichts danke. Kein.
...parents.
Must you take those letters? CALLOWAY Yes, I'm afraid so.
They're Harry's.
That's the reason.
You won't learn anything from them. They are only love letters. There are not many of them.
They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.
Right. Sit down Miss Schmidt, we will send your letters and things back to you.
You know as much as I do, Miss Schmidt - you were intimate with Lime, weren't you?
Do you know this man?
Joseph Harbin...
No.
He works in a military hospital.
No.
In one of his letters he asked you to telephone - a good friend of his called Joseph. He gave you the number of the Casanova Club. That is where a lot of friends of Lime used to go.
You can help us.
Now then, Miss Schmidt, I'm not interested in your forged papers - that's purely a Russian case. When did you last see Lime?
I want the truth, Miss Schmidt. We know he is alive.
Joseph Harbin's body was found in the coffin.
I said another man was buried in his place.
Where's Harry?
That's what we want to find out.
I'm sorry - I don't seem able to understand anything you say. He's alive now this minute - he's doing something.
Miss Schmidt, we know he is somewhere across the canal in the Russian sector... You may as well help us. In a few minutes Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you about your papers. Tell me where Lime is.
I don't know.
Vienna is a closed city, Miss Schmidt, he can't get away.
Must you take those?
They'll be returned, miss.
They are - private - letters.
There you are, miss, your receipt for the letters.
I don't want it.
Here we are. You'll be all right here, Miss.
Thank you, you have been so kind. Anna moves down to stand CL of Paine.
Well, I'll be saying good night. Good night, Miss.
Yes.
I would very much like to meet you, Baron. Come around.
Austrians aren't allowed in your hotel. Couldn't we meet at the Mozart cafe?
Where?
Just around the corner.
How will I know you?
What is it?
We are interested in this case. Have you arrested the girl?
Please keep this passport to yourself, until I make some inquiries, will you, Major?
Yes, of course.
...Austrian Police Headquarters.
Can you tell me whose...
My name is Calloway.
Martins.
You a friend of Lime's?
Yes.
Been here long?
You've had a bit of a shock, haven't you? You could do with a drink.
Could you buy me one. I haven't got any Austrian kroners. Thanks.
Back in school. Never so lonesome in my life till he showed up.
When did you see him last?
See much of him before that?
I'm afraid I've never heard of you. What's your name again?
Holly Martins.
Did you ever hear of "The Lone Rider of Santa Fe?"
I can't say that I have.
"Death at the Double X Ranch" - Ra- a-nch.
Must have known I was broke. Even sent me an airplane ticket. It's a shame.
What?
Him dying like that.
...to him.
What are you trying to say?
...policemen. I have to call them sheriffs.
Ever seen one?
...a cop. You're a real cop I suppose.
Why don't you catch a few murderers for a change?
Listen, Callaghan.
...expense.
What the devil?
Getting around, Martins.
And there was a third man there. I suppose that doesn't sound peculiar to you.
Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan?
Miss Schmidt.
Get the next plane.
As soon as I get to the bottom of this, I'll get the next plane.
Death is at the bottom of everything, Martins. Leave death to the professionals.
What do you want to see a doctor for, huh?
A parrot bit me.
Oh, stop behaving like a fool, Martins.
Well?
Do you see what that means?
That is the racket Harry Lime organized.
Next, Paine.
So would I.
Bring him in.
...a week ago.
...be responsible for you in the streets.
...in the morning.
I followed his shadow until suddenly...
Well?...
This is where he vanished.
I see.
I suppose you don't believe me.
No.
Look...I tell you, you don't think I'm blind, do you?
Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?
Fifty yards right down there.
Which side of the road?
I was on that side, the shadow was on that side, and no turnings on either side.
How about the doorway?
I tell you I heard him running ahead of me.
It wouldn't work.
We'll never get him in the Russian zone.
Calloway!
A girl of spirit.
Didn't I?
Do you mind if I drop off somewhere on the way? I've got an appointment, won't take five minutes...
Of course.
Paine lent me one of your books; "Oklahoma Kid," I think it was. Read a bit of it... Think it's pretty good. What made you take up this sort of thing? Been doing it for long?
All right, Calloway. You win.
I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...
I said you win.
Win what?
What time is it?
Calloway, can't you do something about Anna?
Wait a minute - let me out.
Well, there's not much time.
Be sensible, Martins.
Please be careful, sir. Up we come. Written anything lately?
It's a military hotel.
Write her out a receipt, Paine. Give her a receipt for these letters too.
Very good, sir.
...of Santa Fe."
Shall I go over there, sir?
Get me Major Callaghan on the phone.
...excuse me.
Please hurry up - just get him on the telephone.
Do you know his number?
...his number.
I'll look it up for you.
You do!
Welcome?
They wouldn't know me.
How long can one stay here on this stage money?
Come upstairs a moment.
I know a very good dentist.
It was just a soldier. I was trying to punch his major in the eye.
No, a major, were you really?
Heard of Harry Lime?
I was going to stay with him, but he died Thursday.
Goodness, that's awkward.
...this lecture business, you'll put me up here a while?
Seems exciting.
Oh, Mr. Martins, good evening.
Hello - Mr. Martins, we tried to get you at your hotel. We have arranged that lecture for tomorrow.
What about?
What's that?
Well, yes. I suppose that is what I meant to say.
Zane Grey.
Mr. Crabbin.
What is it, Sergeant?
Mr. Holly Martins, sir.
Who?
The author. Thought you might be interested.
Never heard of him.
Oh, he's very goad, sir. I've read quite a few of his books.
Striptease, sir.
Very popular, sir.
...leaving tomorrow, sir.
Hello, Harry.
Well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.
Listen...
Yes.
I want to talk to you.
Listen, Harry - I didn't believe that...
Hmm.
She's been arrested.
What can I do, old man, I'm dead, aren't I?
You can help her.
...exactly who did you tell about me? Hmm?
Unwise, Holly...
And - Anna...
Did the police believe you?
Well, I've got quite a lot on my mind.
What do you want me to do?
You can get somebody else...
Do you expect me to give myself up?
Why not?
It's far better thing that I do... Holly, you and I aren't heroes, the world doesn't make any heroes...
You've got plenty of contacts.
I'm only safe in the Russian Zone... I'm safe as long as they can use me...
As long as they can use you?
You told them, didn't you?
Don't try to be a policeman, old man.
Part? You can have any part you want, so long as you don't interfere...I have never cut you out of anything yet.
I remember when they raided the gambling joint - you know a safe way out...
Have you ever seen any of your victims?
...this way.
Mr. Martins. Delighted to meet you. Come let's sit down here. Ober! Zwei. What would you like. Tea? Coffee?
Coffee.
It's wonderful how you keep the tension.
You really liked it?
We came out of his place like this, and were walking this way. A friend of his called to him from over there. Harry went across and from up there came the truck. It was just about here.
...were of you.
...you know and all that.
Well, there was only you, and this friend of his. Who is he?
...you.
Not necessarily. She'd probably want to help.
What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to Harry?
...your address?
...the best way one can, you know.
Not yet.
Mr. Popescu is here tonight.
The Roumanian?
Mr. Popescu - Mr. Martins.
Are you mad?
Dr. Winkel?
Vinkel.
Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.
Martins.
Coming to the point, please.
Thank you.
Find out?
Hear the details.
Could he have been at all conscious?
...he was. Yes, for a short time, while they carried him across the road.
In great pain?
Speak English?
Already gone.
Coffin?
Baron Kurtz.
Excuse me!
Did you know Mr. Lime well?
Mr. Lime - yes.
You remember me? Upstairs...
...Popescu...
und ich kann nicht alle kennen.
Sehen sie da gleich da unter. Da unten ist est passiert. Passiert - English.
Happened...Yes happened right down there.
You saw it?
Not saw, heard...heard. I heard the brakes. Wham! And I got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er...er Joseph...that's Joseph Emperor Joseph Statue.
Could he have been conscious?
Conscious? Cas soll ich auch noch wissen?
Oh, er - oh...was he - was he still alive?
Er, alive? He couldn't have been alive, not with his head in the way it was.
I was told that he did not die at once.
...give evidence.
Kurtz.
Yes.
The Roumanian?
Yes.
There was a third man - he didn't give evidence.
You don't mean that doctor?
You gotta tell your story to the police.
Police? Why police? Das ist alles blodsum was sie da sangen. No, no. It is all nonsense; it was an accident.
You don't know it was an accident. You only saw a dead man and three men carry him.
Der ami macht mich noch ganz deppert. I should have listened to my wife. She said you were up to no good. Gossip.
Fer von mir aus gehen sie zur gansalt aber mich lassen sie aus mit der politzei.
Now, hold on.
I have no evidence. I saw nothing. I said nothing. It's not my business.
Yes, it is.
Oh, you did.
Harry...
I thought there was something funny about the whole thing.
Funny?
Something wrong.
That's all you meant?
Wasn't he at the police inquiry?
He didn't want to get involved.
What else did he tell you?
He probably knows a lot more than that. Somebody's lying.
No.
Joseph Harbin.
Third Man.
Mr. Martins...
...this time.
Should I make it all fact?
...Mr. Martins?
Passport, please.
What's the purpose of your visit here?
A friend of mine offered me a job here.
Where are you staying?
With him. Fifteen Stiffgasse.
Lime. Harry Lime.
Okay.
Excuse me.
Yes?
I'm Daffy.
Richard. Hi.
Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out.
Help you out?
Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.
I'm sorry, I don't think so.
I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.
I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it.
I'll share something with you.
If you could see your way to lending me some cash -
Thank you, sir. Thank you. I promise I will repay you.
You. You're the guy that lent me the money.
Yeah, that's right. Now could you be quiet so I can get some sleep.
Ten dollars. I'll find a way to pay you back. How would you like to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach. Paradise. No one else knows about it. That's got to be worth something. What do you say?
Look I don't care about the money right now: I just want some sleep. So if you could be quiet -
Yea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise.
What are you doing in Thailand? Tourist?
Traveler.
You go to Patpong? See smoke from pussy, ping pong ball from pussy, razor blade from pussy; bird from pussy.
I don't think so.
Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world.
Bonjour.
The noise? Don't worry. You're on holiday.
She means your neighbor. The Scotsman
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
It would be nice though, if there was a place like that. You know, that no one could get to.
It's arranged. Tomorrow morning. Eight hundred bath.
Nice work.
He will not take us to the island. It's in the National Park and it is forbidden to go there. But we are allowed to travel to this one to stay for one night.
Yes, of course I can swim. How far do you think it is?
One or two kilometers.
Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going?
Why?
Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point.
I don't know - I'm American.
So?
We think in miles, not kilometers.
So how many miles do you think it is?
Everyone ok?
We're ok.
Richard - I saw a fin!
What!
A shark fin?
I don't know, just a fin. Over there. About a hundred meters.
Big?
Yes.
Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.
Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.
I'm sorry.
She is gone!
She just went under the water. She was pulled under. Oh God, I don't see her.
What about Moliere?
He tried to borrow money from us.
What idiot would lend him money? It would disappear.
He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach.
It's on an island that no one get to.
But he has been there, off course.
We leave our rucksacks on this island and then we swim.
One kilometer
Two.
Bonsoir.
Did you sleep well?
Not too bad.
Hi.
So from there to there?
We swim.
Have you told someone?
No.
Francoise -
I think so too.
You realize that in the eternity of space, there is a planet, just like this one, where you are photographing back towards us. You're photographing yourself.
Incredible.
There are infinite worlds out there, where anything that can happen does happen.
So on one you are rich, on another poor. On one you are a murderer, on another the victim.
Exactly.
That is just the kind of pretentious bullshit that Englishmen and Americans always say to French girls so that they can sleep with them.
Sorry. I thought I was doing quite well.
Too far?
We lost our key.
Do you know the Kentucky friend mouse story?"
Woman bites chicken leg, turns out to be a mouse. Or a rat. It's an urban myth.
Exactly. Always happened to someone else.
So?
So there's an urban myth, well more of a rural myth, going around here at the moment. It's about a beach.
But, Danny, if HaShem is everything, and we are nothing how are we to judge His actions?
You think?! Based on what?
There's midrash supporting this. My father read a book by Shalom Spiegel that -- Isaac actually died and was reborn.
No one follows that midrash.
Watch your language....
And you, if you had come out of Egypt, you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the Golden Calf.
They only kill them when they love them?
What's a fascist?
I rest my case. He's a Jewish Nazi. He always was.
Whereas Avi's a Zionist Nazi.
The Zionists aren't Nazis.
They're racist, they're militaristic, they act like bullyboys in the territories....
They don't have extermination camps.
Read the early Zionists on European Jewry; they sound like Goebbels.
They sound like you.
...So she takes the pants in back -- where they try them on? And I think fuck it....
Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?
Fucking Danny, man...
Didn't you see <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>?
What??
That was an ark, man. That was a Torah. They fucked around with it, and the Torah melted their faces.
That's a movie, you moron.
What do you think you're doing?
Who the fuck are you?
Bring your friends.... We're not his friends.
What, do you like it here?
You coming?
Do we have to listen to this shit?
Yes.
Oh, please...
Where did you read this? Robert Faurisson?
Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he --
What do you care?
I don't, but...
It's called the flame alphabet. It's supposed to be the word of God written in fire.
Fire...
How come you know all this shit?
How come you don't know it? How can you say you hate the Jews when you don't know anything about --
Fuck you. I hate the Jews at least as much as you do.
Yeah, but not on the letters.
Why the fuck not?
You write that? Come work for me. You've got a lot to learn; I can teach it to you.
I have a job.
This? This is a joke. I'll give your group a thousand bucks.
You gave fifty thousand to that college magazine.
Fifty's an exaggeration. Anyway, that was a different moment. Things were possible that aren't now.
Actually, I think this moment has possibilities that --
Forget the Jewish stuff. It doesn't play anymore. There's only the market, now, and it doesn't care who you are.
People still need values, beliefs....
No, they don't. Not the smart ones. Look, I'll give you five grand if you can document your tax-exempt status.... But when you fall off this horse, come see me. I can show you how to make a lot of money.
I don't care about money.
You will.
You're a Jew. Maybe you don't realize it, but you are.
Have you read Toynbee? Spengler?
Nobody reads that stuff anymore.
Too difficult?
Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul Virilio?
The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease.
Disease? What disease?
Which is what?
You're not in school? What do you do?
I work at the Big Boy warehouse. In Queens. I drive a fork-lift.
Where'd you read all that stuff?
Why no silencer?
"...<i>und die Worte zerfielen mir im Munde wie modrige Pilze</i>..."
"And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms..."
How come so many of the books are in Spanish?
They're my father's. He's from Argentina. My mother's family went there during the war. That's where they met.
Are they still together?
He's in a mental institution.... He's been there for ten years, off and on. Mostly on.
Is he a Nazi?
I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that.
What's he care about?
You think people ever commit suicide out of happiness?
You're not like the others, are you?... Your friends.
I bet. He didn't realize that nobody who talks such a good game ever plays one.
Too many good players down here. I'm with one right now.
Oh, really?
Bigger and better.
Who's Linda?
Why won't you talk to me?
When can I see you?
Your father??
I'm coming to your room tonight.
Where'd you get this?
How come there's no punctuation?
That was a later invention, it's not in the scrolls.... Anyway, the Jews know where the sentences end. They know the whole thing by heart. Every word. Every letter.
Do you know it like that? By heart.
No.
But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?
What do you care?
Va-yomer... And he said. It goes the other way.
Oh, yeah...
Va-yomer adonai el Avram: lech lecha mayartzcha oo-mimohlad-tcha oo-m'bayt avaycha el ha-ertez asher arecha...
What's it mean?
I want to learn to read it.
Why?
Know your enemy.... 'Cause it's a basic text of Western culture. I want to read it in the original. Okay?
Hebrew's very difficult. It would take years.
Put something on. You're not supposed to be naked in front of it.
Why not?
They think it's the word of God, and it's holy, and the flesh isn't....
That's stupid.
See, the Jews love to separate things: the holy from the profane, milk from meat, wool from linen, the Sabbath from the week, the Jew from the gentile.... As if one little scrap of this was going to completely contaminate that.
What assholes.
Who gets contaminated, the Jews or the gentiles?
Good question. Both. Aleph...
It looks a little like a swastika.
It's silent. It holds a place, takes a vowel. The vowels are little dots that go under the letters.
Where are they?
They don't put them in the Torah. I'll get you a chumash, they'll have them there...Bet...Gimel...Dalid...Hay... How come you're here instead of with Curtis? Besides the Hebrew lessons...
The sex is better.
Even though his dick is so big?
With you there's a tragic dimension.
Payn tash-chiton v'ashiytem...
V'asitem...
V'asitem lechem pessel to-monat. And make no graven image of the Lord, or the form of any figure, or of man or woman, or beast or fowl or fish or anything that looks like anything. Because He's not like anything. Not only can't you see Him or hear Him, you can't even think about Him. I mean, what's the difference between that and Him
No difference.
Christianity's silly, but at least there's something to believe in. Or not believe. Judaism there's nothing.
Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's not about belief.
What's it about?
About doing things. You light candles, say prayers, keep the Sabbath, visit the sick....
And belief follows?
No. Nothing follows. You don't do it because it's smart or stupid or it saves your soul. You're not saved. Nobody's saved. You do it because the Torah tells you do. You submit to the Torah.
Fuck that.
Don't curse in front of it.
Why should I submit?
You shouldn't.
No, I think you shouldn't.
You're learning the Hebrew really fast.
I told you, I'm good at this.
Plus you have nothing else to do all day.
What...? You think I'm Jewish?
Nazis talk about it all the time.
The real Nazis. Hitler, Goebbels, they talked about Jews incessantly.... You ever read their diaries?...
Is that why you became a Nazi? So you could talk about Jews incessantly?
Believe me, Adolf Hitler couldn't possibly have hated the Jews as much as I do. Not in a billion years. You know why?
'Cause he wasn't a rabbi.
You want a punch in the mouth?
Okay... Why don't we light candles on Friday? Let's light candles.... And say the kaddish.
Kaddish is the prayer for the dead.
You can't. Do you know how many people I've brought into...the movement...?
Come on, we can be like Eichmann. He studied Torah. He hated Jews.
Is it like Eichmann? Are we goofing?
I don't know. I just want to try it.
Shit... Did you talk to your mother today?
No. What are you looking for?
Nothing. Why are you doing this? I thought God didn't exist.
He commands it whether He exists or not... Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
And be crushed.
Look, just light the candles with me. Then we'll eat. You have to eat.
Miriam called, looking for you. She said you might come, so I...
You gotta get out of here.
Carla?... It's me, Danny...Danny Balint...? We met at that...[meeting at your house.]
Yeah, I remember.... Kill any Jews yet?
I didn't realize you cared.
I don't. I was just curious how full of shit you were.
Did you know that there was a <i>New York Times</i> reporter there that night?
Really, which one? I bet it was the guy with the Prada shoes.
I didn't notice his shoes.... Did your mother know he was there?
I doubt it. How did you find out?
That's a much easier game.
I thought there were people here....
Who's Eichmann?
Shema yisrael adonai elohenu adonai echod.
What'd you say?
Why are you taking that?
...I thought we agreed, no anti- Semitism...it's exactly what we're trying to put behind us.... Trash the blacks, fine; but...
Did you see how they reacted to him?
Yes, of course. But that only plays in this room, with people who aren't embarrassed to call themselves Nazis. If you want a modern fascism, you don't mention Jews.
It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It always has been.
An investment banking house.
Danny, the night we met, you said the name Ilio Manzetti. We were impressed. We were excited. But here it is September, and Mr. Manzetti is still walking around breathing the air.
More cultural than political.
Obviously.
That would be a catastrophic mistake.
People hate Jews. Do you agree?
They used to. Today it's not an issue.
You wouldn't announce it?
I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason.
But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.
Totally. The family emigrated from Bulgaria when he was eleven.
How would you kill him?
...Insulting people who were in the camps. ...What's the point?
They're liars and cowards.
I'm sure they are. But what do we accomplish by pointing it out?
Leo Strauss... I've got to go to Boston. I came to say goodbye.
What about Mrs. Moebius and...?
They left an hour ago. You mind some personal advice? Forget Carla. That's not the side your bread's buttered on. How soon can you get back to the city?
A week or so. There's something I want to do here first.
We want to build bridges to certain positions in the political mainstream: works like <i>The Bell Curve</i>, <i>Sociobiology</i>, anti-Zionism, anti- immigration, the com-munitarian issue.... We'll hold conferences: invite liberals, blacks, Jews. Chomsky, Cockburn, Stanley Crouch, Shahack....
What about...Manzetti, the synagogues....
That doesn't seem to be happening, does it?
Is it okay if I record this?
No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So what's this about? Is this about me?
I'm trying to figure out where the radical right is going to next....I thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting.
What about Curtis Zampf?
Curtis is a politician -- and a bit of a hustler. He's not a thinker.
I agree.
The other night you said the modern world is a Jewish disease. Could you elaborate on that?
In the movement -- the racialist movement -- we believe there's a hierarchy of the races. Not just in IQ, but in the civilization, the art, the forms of government, the civilizations that each race produces... Why are you writing this down if you're recording it?
It helps me concentrate.... So does that mean you're a white supremacist?
What should I be, a white inferior- ist? A multicultural Zulu egalitarian? Let me ask, where are your people from?
My mother's family is French, my father's was German, originally.
German. Mine, too. So who do you think's given more to the world, the Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche -- or the entire continent of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos...
The Jews are different.... Blacks are disgusting and inferior, but it's like criticizing a retarded child. The Jews are...a poison in the human well....
A poison...?
Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.
Sexuality??? What do you mean?
You ever fuck a Jewish girl?
What??!?
Did you ever fuck one, Guy?
What's that go to do with...I've gone out with a, with Jewish women. Why?
And? WHat did you notice?
Notice? Like what...?
Jewish girls like to give head, right?
I don't know. Is that right?
And Jewish men like to get it.
Everybody likes to, don't they?
Yes. It's very pleasurable. But the Jews are obsessed with it. You know why?
Why?
Because the Jew is essentially female.
Female...
Real men -- white, Christian men -- we fuck a woman. We make her come with our cocks. But the Jew doesn't like to penetrate and thrust -- he can't assert himself that directly -- so he resorts to perversions. Oral sex is technically a perversion, you know that, don't you? After a woman has been with a Jewish man, she never wants a
Does that mean the Jew is the better lover?
You're not listening. He isn't better. He gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness.
Danny, what makes you think you know all this?
Let's just say I've done due diligence.
So, fine, it's not that the Jew, the Jews own the media and the banks. It's that they're sexually corrupt.
Deracinate... Tear out the roots. A people -- a real people -- derives its genius from the land: the sun, the sea, the soil. This is how they know themselves. But the Jew doesn't have soil.
He has Israel.
Those aren't Jews.
Of course they're Jews.
Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he "universalizes" everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns
Are all Jews the same?
What? Excuse me?... You're kidding, right?
Do you know Rabbi Stanley Nadelman? He used to be at Congregation Beth Elohim in Ozone Park...?
Who? How would I know him?
He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.
You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?
So you're saying it's not true.
Were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else?
Do you know who you're fucking with here?
That's what I'm trying to find out, Danny. Who am I fucking with here?
Listen to me....
Why would Nadelman lie?
To discredit me. Because I know who they are. Look, I thought I explained it to you. Those people can say or do anything. And they will. It's all narrative to them, it's... Are you going to print what this guy said?
Give me a reason not to.
It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.
But if the Jews are strengthened by hate, wouldn't this "destruction" you speak of -- by love or by any other means -- in fact make them more powerful than they are already?
Did you kill Ilio Manzetti?
Two days ago you addressed a Nazi rally. Last week you went to a Torah study group.
What were you, following me?
How do you reconcile the two?
I don't. Look, stay out of what you don't understand.
Explain it so I can.
You work for the <i>New York Times</i>. Your whole job in life is not to understand things like me.
I don't think you know what you are.
Yeah, and what are you? A <i>Times</i> man? A Presbyterian? Impotent? A prick?
Who killed Manzetti?
If I tell you, will you pull the story? Not write about me?
It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would. Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?
I always won.
Why did you come tonight? To see me?
To hear them read Torah.
I thought you hated Torah.
That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it.
You know the joke: a Jew's shipwrecked on a desert island. When they rescue him, they see he's built two synagogues. They say, for vhat do you need two synagogues? He says, vun to pray in, and vun I'd never set foot in so long as I live, so help me God. You pray in the one you'd never set foot in...and vice versa.
I can't help what I think.
Tell me about Lina Moebius.
How did you...?
I work in the DA's office. You go to those meetings, half the people there are informants.
You mean the <i>Times</i> guy?
Which <i>Times</i> guy?
You're telling me you killed him? You? Killed him? Bullshit. What kind of gun did you use?
A forty-five.
It was a nine millimeter.
You're lying.
So are you... But they'll believe you.... Lina Moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea. That you proposed it in a meeting at her house. Ah, Jesus, Danny... What were you thinking? Are you glad Manzetti's dead? Do you really want to kill Jews? You want to kill me?
All right, what if all along you were actually infiltrating the Nazis -- to expose them....
But I wasn't.
And only talked about killing Manzetti to convince them you were an anti-Semite. If you'd had any idea somebody would take it seriously, you never would have said it.
I can't say that.
Think about your father. Your sister.
The truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it?
Danny, I'm trying to -- save you.
You shut up. Who do you think you are?
How did you get the fucking number?
I want you to say kaddish for her. It's the only thing she asked from us....
I don't do that.
You do it on the inside....
Don't tell me what I --
...I want you to do it on the outside, too.
No!
Lina Moebius. And you are...?
Daniel Balint.
Balint?
It's German.
What part of Germany are you people from?
From the Rhineland originally.
Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?... Or any other law enforcement agency?
Without blood -- a willingness to spill it -- there's no real power, no authority.
Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.
We're already marginal. We are saying what no one else has the guts to say. Isn't that precisely our appeal?
So what Jew would you kill first?
Do you feel you're making progress here?
You mean Ilio Manzetti?
How have things been going?
Fine.
Hello...?
Lina... It's happening. Tonight.
What is happening?
Beth Shalom. Like you wanted.
Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?
What about chicken?
That's meat.
The Bible only says don't seethe a kid in its mother's milk. But chickens don't give milk.
Look, you want cheese, go someplace else.
But it's stupid, right? You admit it's stupid.
No, I don't admit it's stupid.
You can have chicken with eggs but not with milk. Why is that?
I'm not here to talk about religious law, if you don't like --
But you already talked about it: you said it's not stupid. Why isn't it stupid?
Steve...
What are you doing here?
He's going to die. He won't take his medicine. He eats dairy. He probably still smokes when I'm not around. I asked him to come live with us. Alex offered to share his room, unsolicited.... But he didn't want to be any trouble.
Then he couldn't be bitter about living alone.
Ah, Jesus Christ, Danny, how can you wear that thing?... You know what it means? To your people...
They're not my people....
Tell it to Hitler.
Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief rabbi now?...
Is this because of those kids who used to beat you up?
What kids?...
The Polacks? From Sacred Heart?
Nobody ever beat me up. Look, Linda, there're fifty reasons. Even if you knew them all, there'd be another fifty you didn't know.
Do you know them? I made him some noodles for dinner. You can heat them up and --
I've got to get back to the --
Hello...?
Daniel Balint? My name's Guy Danielsen. I'm a reporter with the <i>New York Times</i>.
I'm doing a piece on right-wing groups, post Oklahoma City. I hear you're an important figure in those circles. You have a lot of interesting ideas....
Who told you that?
Isn't it true?
Who knows what that is?
A Jewish prayer.
Which was his room?
Where's Mrs. Moebius?
That was unbelievable what you did to Lucas. The guy's an animal.
You could do it.
Get out of here....
Which one were you aiming at?
What is it?
Shut up. Fuck you....
Open it up.
This will be a different kind of device.
That damn thing. You know how it made me look...?
I'm sorry, Danny. It won't happen again. I'm going to use a brand-new power cell. Plus we'll have a back-up timer.
I've gotta kill some Jews, Kyle. I'm serious. I'm always talking about it. This time it's gotta happen.
What about Drake, did he ever show up?
That's all we've got left.
Didn't you get anything?
Oh, what is this shit?
Keep driving. Don't slow down.
Not too fast.
You said they didn't have night guards.
They don't. I checked twenty times.... Somebody must have talked.
Who even knew?
Mrs. Moebius.
Why? Why would she?
The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated.
Take a right on 59th... We'll put it someplace else.
Where?
If I went back to the lumberyard, the guy'd give me all the dynamite I wanted. Untraceable, you wouldn't -- need to...
No, it has to be tomorrow. You won't get this many of them in here for another year. It'll be fine.
It's not going to be fine. It's --
When do you want it to go off?
Seven-thirty tomorrow evening.
Jeez, it's been since, what, Kenny's wedding.
Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on?
I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS...
JTS...?
What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet.
I'm in a kind of...underground...thing.
Are you an artist?
You remember Miriam....
She's at Yale Law -- interning with the district attorney... We're getting married next spring. In Israel.
Listen, Danny, you can't just barge in and --
Danny, listen, people expect me to daven; they don't want someone they don't know -- leading their prayers.
Lie on your stomach and come up on your elbows.
Why me?
Who'd you kill?
How did you know they were Jews?
I can tell....
How?
Shoot him in the head. Always shoot a Jew in the head.
I'm a bad shot. I don't think I can --
You missed on purpose.
I didn't. I told you, I can't --
And what did you do?
What are you trying to say?
You can't say that....
SO THEY SHOT HIM! SO HE WAS DEAD. SO WHAT. HE'S WORSE THAN DEAD NOW. HE'S A PIECE OF SHIT...
Okay, that's it. You're going back to --
Where do you think you're going?
It's Friday....
The Torah says not to light a fire on the Sabbath, because it's work, correct? But if alternating current's running through the wires every second of every day, and I throw a switch, send it here instead of there, how is that lighting a fire?
"Do chickens give milk?"
Who's this?
Dennis Leary.
Leary?
Howard Stern.
Adam Sandler.
Funny?
Not like Mr. Dorfmann.
After your mother died, that's when you stopped going to shul. Doing your homework. Everything.
And that's when the Mets started to stink.
'Cause they got rid of Johnson. He knew how to deal with the assholes. Dallas Green, please...
There's some maple walnut in the freezer.
Linda says you're not supposed to have dairy.
We want you to help run it. Give speeches, lead seminars... Handle the fund-raising.
Fund-raising??
I'm not an intellectual.... I mean, I read, but... Fund-raising isn't what I...
Do you have a suit? Let's get him one.... And a cell phone too. And if you insist on blowing up a synagogue, make it that big one on Fifth Avenue, would you?
Beth Shalom? It's Reform.
So what?
They're not that Jewish.
We tested the new bomb.
What?
We redesigned the timing mechanism. It can't possibly malfunction.
Are you out of your mind?!
Do you think I...
May He cause the light of His countenance to shine upon you and be gracious unto you....
Eat shit....
...May you be blessed in your going forth as you were in your coming....
EAT SHIT, ASSHOLES....
Oh, fuck you...
...You're saying that when he first appeared at your house, you had no idea he was Jewish....
None whatsoever. But I have to admit, I'm not terribly surprised.
What do you mean?
In the Third Reich, weren't a number of high-ranking Nazis of Jewish origin?
Yes, and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the Final Solution. Really, who but a Jew would want to kill Ilio Manzetti simply because he was Jewish? Who thinks about such things?
The papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague, Curtis Zampf, has been a federal informant for the past two years. Do you believe that?
Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now.
You're going to live here permanently?
He's shy, not like Enzo.
Yes. Not like Enzo.
I think, he's really nice... He's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.
Are you going to keep it?
Yes.
Does he know?
No.
Maybe you should talk to him about it.
I was thinking of something kinda stupid last night. You know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the Gods. Take Leda for example, sleeping with Jupiter, who came to earth as a swan... Well, can you imagine Leda announcing to her swan "You're going to be a father, my little chick-a-dee"?
But your man isn't quite a God!
Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him.
And you...? Do you love Enzo?
You're leaving?
Yes... Could you please give this to Enzo.
Bonita, you shouldn't be discouraged so easily.
Did you tell him?
Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment.
This is good work... unfortunately it's incomplete. Could you eat a sandwich 40 floors above the street.
What kind?
Johana, am I boring you?
Sorry. Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little. What did you say?
Did the driver really freeze?
Like a popsicle. They're keeping him on a stick until spring.
My God! I'm glad I didn't go.
Listen, I just found out we've got real problems in Sicily!
What d'you mean?
What's happened??
The documents are forged.
No!
Yes! The notary is a phony. He has the same signature as the contractor!
It can't be true!
We have to send somebody over there immediately! If we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy. We'll be off the hook. There's a flight to Rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to Sicily.
I'll send Cardoza, he'll be able to...
I tried him, he can't go. His son is being Bar Mitzvohed tomorrow... I'll go, boss.
I thought it was Spanish that you spoke?
Good afternoon.
I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.
Yes. Of course. Very wise.
Remember when I went to Italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium. Well, we weren't being cheated by the Mafia or anybody except maybe by me... ... Do they come for lunch everyday? I really went on my own business, to see a man that I happen to be in love with... and I'm glad I did it, but I'm sorry about
You're right. You're fired.
Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave? I'm pregnant.
The Italian, I presume?
No. He's French, he was just in Italy for the competition.
He seems to have won it.
I tell you she's mine!
Hello!
You know each other?
Yes.
This is a great pleasure.
I wish, but it's full. They recommended a pension in town. They say that all of Taormina is full. What's going on here?
A spaghetti del mare for the super dedicated traveling insurance agent.
Where did you two meet?
In a lake.
I might have known. As I was telling you earlier, I'm the world champion free diver.
Congratulations.
A new world record! That's great! It gives me something to beat tomorrow! You ever been to Tahiti?
No.
You forgot the Hula!
Yes, of course, I'll do the Hula!
He looks strange, doesn't he? Like a baby that just learned to walk.
Have you known him long?
Forever. We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids.
What was he like, when he was little?
Little. Very little. And skinny, very skinny too. That is compared to me.
I get it, Enzo you were a superior child.
And just where are you from?
Huh? Well listen to him! Do you hear that?
No.
He looks me in the eye like some fuckin' gold fish, and says: "I'm going to beat you".
... That's what he's here for, isn't he?
Tonight we're having a little party among ourselves. 8 o'clock in my suite?
... It's easy. You go down. You come up. ... Right, Johana?
Congratulations, Enzo.
And the lights! Running lights, stealing stretchers...! You'll have us in jail.
Well, good night, then...
You going to sleep here, all by yourself?
... It's a comfortable place.
Sinister is what I'd call it...! Ours is so much cheerful! Why don't you come and stay with me... There's plenty of room in my suite.
The Mamma's there too.
Yes, the Mamma is is there.
Is it a poem?
Jacques! Johana!
Okay, now we have a good five minutes to have a nice peaceful talk.
What are you doing here?
Checking out the competition.
Enzo, why do you guys do this?
What else is there?
You risk your life when you cross the street.
Damn it! Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!
Because you'd laugh.
I won't, I swear.
A little... You think it's the same for Jacques?
No. Jacques is a creature of the sea. He isn't meant to live on earth, among us... You should know this, Johana.
He can learn. He is learning.
You really think so? Did you tell him you were pregnant?
How do you know that?
... Not yet.
Don't.
Why?
Because he won't understand and it will just hurt you... Jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake. And he's only waiting for one thing: that some God up there will turn him into a fish! How long has that moron been down there?
Five minutes and fifty seconds.
Is he alright? What happened?
How did it happen?
The company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, I fucked up! Can you help?
Ten thousand.
Lira?
Dollars.
In my village, we have a saying: when the wind blows, the flags of all nations flap in the same direction.
Roberto? How long?
Enzo, what are you going to do with the money?
Have the car painted.
Santini will do that for 25 dollars!
Then tell him to wax it too.
Enzo, really. What are you going to get?
Yes?
What about the shoes?
Enzo, wake up!
The medics are looking all over for you.
Where did you get that?
Is he here?
Plenty of women everywhere right?
Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
It isn't lit yet.
You shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board!
Listen we're not supposed to piss either but that doesn't stop you from carrying "it" on board?!
The rules are the rules.
... What's your name again?
Noireuter.
And where did you say you were from?
What's with the voice?
It's nothing. It's just the helium, because of the air pressure.
And... does the voice come back?
For others, yes... For you, who knows?
Is that alcohol? Are you out of your mind? Alcohol is strictly forbidden.
Well, if it isn't the little Frenchman! How is the little Frenchman?
You don't mind if I go instead, do you?
No...
Jacques, my friend, how are you?
That's good. You never would have recognized me, huh? Check out the suit! Looking good, no? You know I'm the world champion?
Yes, I know.
I dove 315 feet!
Great!
Why?
Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.
I don't want to be in any competition... I dive because I like to, not to beat a record... don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him?
No. All you need is to want to be the best.
You're the best, Enzo!
I remember. Hi Roberto!
What room have you got?
I don't have one.
You don't have a room? Paolo? What did I just hear? I personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend Jacques Mayol and you treat him like a stranger?!
It's okay, Enzo. I'll go somewhere else.
Not only is Jacques Mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world! And you're throwing him out! Are you crazy, or what? Stupido!
... So, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask. Am I right?
Well, what are they?
That's good.
How do you make a living? Your experiments, does it pay well?
It's okay.
No.
So, not married. Well, good for you. You play the field, like me. A girl in every port, huh?
Exactly, I mean, after all, we're men!
Damn right! That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.
People say that?
No, no!
Not at all!
Enzo?
What?
Your mother?
Madame...
C'mon, you two... Jacques, we have to get ready for the ceremony tonight. We have a new world champion.
I'm a little tired, I don't know if...
No.
Why?
Today at lunch, you asked me if I had any questions.
Ah ha. You finally want to know about women.
Why? Are they what's most important?
No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know?
... Everything.
Everything about what?
Why?
Two years younger than you.
As I said, second of all you're too skinny. You've got tiny lungs. I still don't understand how you can dive without getting sick.
The size of the lungs has nothing to do with it!
Tell me, why don't you go and get your medal?
No, I have to ask you a favor... You're the only one who'll understand.
Hey! Will you slow down! When did you learn how to drive?
Good night.
You don't need a stretcher to take her with you. You know that, don't you?
What?
Here... Here...
What is it?
You still collect them?
Yes.
You don't have that one, do you?
No. Thank you. It's really beautiful.
Can I come in?
He doesn't like us.
... I was seventeen, I loved her so much I tried to die for her. Two years later I couldn't even remember her name! Let me tell you, time erases everything!
I don't want to erase anything.
You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
... Yes.
I give you this. You're stubborn... Dumb, but stubborn.
Anybody can have a bad day!
I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.
Enzo, Enzo! Congratulations!
That's good.
... How long was I asleep?
I'm concentrating.
It's not safe, they say. The doctors say it isn't possible to go deeper and live. Free diving is over as a sport.
You say that because you have the title!
No! I would never cheat you.
You were right.
... I was right about what?
... Push me back in the water...
I can't.
Don't you have a heater?
Yeah... Sure... Is this your first trip to Peru?
A drink to warm up?
Yes, thank you. Intravenous if possible.
Tea... or whiskey?
Would it be out of place to ask what he's doing?
Who?
I recognize you.
We saw each other a little while ago.
In the lake?
Please, have a seat.
But what brought you to Sicily?
No, no. You'll like it. It's superb.
Thanks for helping with the bag. It looks great!
I thought it was a nice place. Isn't it?
You're going to be very busy these days aren't you?
I don't know... why?
Yes... Maybe... I don't know. I don't like competitions... It ruins the fun. Don't you think?
I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?
I thought you'd be at the dinner.
You look adorable.
Thank you...
Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.
Lucky I was there to save you.
You jumped in?
Only to help the medics, I assure you.
No. I want to show you. Is it ruined?
Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...
Just checking up on your family. I guess I was drunker than I thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress... Well...
I'm glad you stayed. Thank you.
I'd better get back now.
... No?
How can you tell it's a female?
She's not like the others. She can't stand to be away from the sea.
How do you know that?
Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?
Jacques, you set a world record.
I did?
I'm going back home.
Why?
Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.
Yes you do. You know exactly what I'm talking about. You're afraid I want to hold onto you, and I do, but you're not ready... at least not for me.
Hello?
How are you?
I got fired.
So have I. ... Hello?
I'm still here.
Well, then, talk to me some more.
... It's hard you know. You're so far away and I don't know what else to say.
Then, tell me a story.
Do you know how it is? Do you know what you're supposed to do to meet a mermaid?
No... tell me.
Hello?
I'm being a pain, huh?
... Not at all.
You sure?
Absolutely positive.
Why did you take me to the hotel, if you live here.
Bonjour Monsieur... Louis.
Uncle Louis. He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?
And you?
I didn't dive.
You'll try again tomorrow?
What?
What are you doing?
Jacques...?
What's wrong?
It's nothing. Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.
You want to lie down for a while?
... When you dive... with that machine... What does it feel like?
... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom.
Why?
You've got to tell me what happened?
Jacques? I'm pregnant.
That's good... that's wonderful. It's wonderful for you.
Promise me one thing.
Anything.
Mayol... Mayol... No reservation.
... Are you sure?
This is the hotel San Domenico?
Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.
You shouldn't dive everyday, Papa.
Hey! Have you ever seen a mermaid?
Why don't you ask me?
What?
Assassin!
Uncle Louis, this is my friend Johana.
Did you buy the cassettes? The Wagner, the Berlioz?
I brought Johana to meet you.
Are you crazy? I have no use for a woman! Since my accident.
Where are you from, Henrietta?
Johana... New York.
What kind of name is that? To be named after a city?
Uncle Louis!
Good. That way I'll see more of you... Where are you going to stay?
Well... here.
In my apartment?
It's my apartment.
Liar! Thief! Torturer! When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast.
Uncle Louis, we have a guest!
Uncle Louis, you remember Enzo's mother Signora Molinari from Amorgos?
What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway?
Louis, we were French!
I changed the lock you son of a bitch!
You're back! Hello. We were burgled.
Again?
... And the new stereo.
I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
Yep. How was your trip...? Help me clean up, okay?
You called the police?
Well?
What?
How was your trip?
Nice... Very interesting... Great! ... I guess.
It's his heartbeat.
I thought you said he was Peruvian?
... Since eight o'clock last night...! You're in love.
... And if we repaint the walls, we'll need new curtains, you put the painters on you Visa and I'll do the curtains on American Express... for the couch there's Bloomingdales... or are you still over your limit?
Way past it.
Does that have a hidden meaning?
No. I'm just depressed.
You look it too. You haven't been working out, you haven't been taking your vitamins! You haven't been drinking your herbs, you haven't been...
I know, I know! I'm a terrible person... It's... I'm so damn, damn sad.
What is it honey... the frenchy?
Do you think I should have stayed? Don't you think maybe I should have stayed? I've been a jerk, right? I should have stayed! I was supposed to be in love... I was in love! I am in love, why did I act like a bitch? He went swimming. All the man did was go swimming! I must be crazy. It was too good
What are they for?
They're paramedics. They wait at 180 feet.
If there was a problem, they could do something right?
... And those?
Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet. They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture. At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.
What's that little air bottle on the machine?
That isn't for the divers actually. It's for the balloon. It blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator. Without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed.
But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?
Who... Who is that?
Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
... The truck fell into a very deep crevasse. We weren't able to save the equipment.
I'll have to talk to the driver.
My dear, science is a cruel mistress.
But... how is he going to breathe?
He's in the fluoroscope now. Listen to his heart. Impressive, huh? The flow of blood is concentrated in the brain and doesn't even feed the limbs anymore. It's a phenomena that has only been observed with dolphins... until now.
How long can he stay down? Without breathing?
It depends. He should come up soon. Unless he's decided to stay for the night.
Why is he doing this?
Shouldn't somebody take him a blanket or something?
Will he understand Spanish?
Okay, listen, just get the custom's office to send me a copy as fast as possible. We can't send you new equipment until our file is complete. Okay?
Okay, okay. You'll have it by the end of the week, how's that?
You've made me a happy insurance person.
Wait! Professor...?
I'll go see how he's doing.
Alright Mordechai, now that we're alone I just want to say that I'm not happy about this. I don't want a repeat of that incident in the West Bank.
I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do.
A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it?
I guess I could be chalant about it, but then again I'm not even sure if that's a word. Listen Chief, we could stand around arguing all day, but I gotta case to crack.
What's your first move?
Chief, it's me. Listen carefully. I need for the Worldwide Jewish Media Conspiracy to mass produce video copies of every Hollywood movie ever made featuring a positive Jewish protagonist as its lead.
You mean you want us to make copies of Yentl, Fiddler On The Roof, and Chaim Potok's The Chosen?
It was a trap. I'm back at square one.
Well, then I've got good news for you. We just got word that he'll be making an appearance at the Mall Of America today. I'm sending Esther to meet you there at once.
Good thinking. We'll disguise ourselves as a Gentile couple to pass undetected. Now that he thinks I'm dead, this should be a piece of homentashen.
Mordechai. Thank god you're here.
What's up?
Looks like I got a plane to catch.
Take Esther with you, you'll need the backup.
So why the long face?
It's Esther. Santa's got her.
Please. Will you help me?
There won't be any need for that sir.
Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands.
So. Do you have a name?
It's Esther.
You like my Mordechai, yes?
Hanukkah, Shmanukkah. It isn't even one of the high holidays. What concerns me more is that my boychick is almost thirty, and has yet to settle down with a nice Jewish girl. I'll make you a deal. I'll help you with your little Hanukkah problem if you help me with my Mordechai.
What do you want me to do?
Well, for starters, we're going to honeymoon in Boca for a week. And then, when we get back, Morty's been talking about taking a stable, good paying job as a consultant for the JDL.
Mr. Jefferson Carver?
Please, call me Mordechai.
From the way she carried herself I could tell she'd been around the block a few times...
Client notes. Sorry. What can I do for you?
My name is Esther. Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal from the Jewish Defense League desperately needs to speak with you.
How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on?
Your mother? Oh. Whoops.
Mordechai, Santa Claus has been rubbed out by his son Damian. The man's a demon. There's no telling what this new anti semitic psycho Santa is capable of.
Oy vey, I'm stuffed.
Any sign of Santa?
What are we going to do? We're at least an hour from the front.
That got annoying fairly quickly.
So, now what?
Want to get a drink?
What was that!?
What!?
I said, yeah, about once a week!
Sorry. I'm better with men.
Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing.
Mordechai?
Yes Esther.
I want you to talk dirty to me.
I want for our children to go to private schools and take music lessons. Little Abraham will go to Stanford for college, Batya will go Ivy League, maybe Vassar.
Keep going.
Also, on a daily basis, I want you to tell me what to do, where to do it, and how I should live my life.
Your mother was right. You do work too hard.
When did you guys have this conversation? When I was in the bathroom? What else did she have to say?
Oh my god. She's become my pimp. And she's whoring her bitch-son out to the highest bidder.
We do!
What are you doing here?
Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you do this alone.
I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.
Esther!
Esther!
You two know each other?
Shabat Shalom mama. I brought some Manischewitz. The black label.
Mordechai. Do you love your mother?
Mom, I have a real job. I do good things for this community. I help people.
When I play bridge with all the girls, everyone has what to talk about with their sons. They show pictures. Their sons are lawyers and doctors and Rabbis. Why can't I show a picture?
So don't show a picture.
I don't want to argue with you. Let's just eat in peace.
No. No. We're gonna argue. And you know what mom? I'm going to save Hanukkah just to spite you. And when my face is all over the television. When your friends are opening their Hanukkah gifts next year, don't mention it to them, okay? I wouldn't want you to have to show my picture.
Let's let your tuchus breathe.
...and the opportunity to help my brothers and sisters in the Jewish community.
...and their children will all be able to eat latkes and spin dreidels, and light the menorah with the knowl...
Well I have news for you mom. It is good enough...I'm good enough and I won't leave here until I hear you tell me...
Hello Mazel Tov! A boojee boojee boojee boo...
Mom! We're eating!
Happy Hanukkah Tikva.
Okay, what's the information?
Anything else?
But we're not open on Sundays.
I understand that. I just thought that you might want to know.
So Morde-chai, tell me, what brings your bad self down to the KLF?
I'm back on the job for the JDL. You hear about that crazy white boy who took over as Santa?
Actually, I...I don't. What does that mean?
Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
You watch your back Hammer. Hanukkah might just be his first move. For all we know Kwanzaa could be next. There's a lot of brothers counting on you. If you fail...
Okay, look. I'm going to work really, really hard on this one. But, please stop with the pressure. I'm already tense as it is.
What's wrong with him?
It's gonna be tough, but the back entrance looks like our best bet.
Cool. What's it do?
Man, that's far out! Hey, the Jets won!
Porno? You're tellin' me that you can get porno on that thing?
What are you doing?
Wait! Before we enter, you need to know that my research has determined that Santa's compound is wired with the XP 2000 stereo type alarm system.
A stereo type alarm system?
How do we bypass it?
Listen cat, I'll have you know that I hate the taste of watermelon and am a terrible basketball player.
What are you doing?
Hammer, you alright?
Sorry folks, I don't do couples.
If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt.
Let me guess, you're the goy who stole Hanukkah.
What's your shpiel, Santa?
What are you doing?
Hey everybody. How's it hangin'?
Where's my girlfriend Santa?
I shlepped all the way to the North Pole for this? I come to fight you, and you don't even put out anything to nosh on? What kind of arch nemesis are you?
So, what's our first plan of attack Santa?
What should I charge?
So what's in the boxes? Heroin? Cocaine?
Bootleg copies of the Frank Capra classic, 'It's A Wonderful Life.'
So, how was I?
I wasn't too over the top?
No, it was the perfect level.
You okay?
No. I'm airsick you asshole! Where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly?
Get off of me you cripple!
What's going on? Why'd he stop?
Maybe he ran out of ammo.
Well, he's kinda just resting in the corner with his girlfriend.
What day is it?
You want me to be nice to him for no apparent reason whatsoever, buy him clothing he'll never wear, and for just one day of the year pretend to forgive him for all the horrible things he did to me as a young boy when my mommy wasn't looking?
Is someone with you -- can I get you a drink?
My soninlaw. What do you think of him?
When you marry champagne, Clo-Clo, you can't trade it in for beer. You're stuck with it.
I can't understand that fancy talk. You mean I'm a gold-digger? Sure, I'm a gold-digger -- why not?
Maybe I should just forget all about money - - forget about mamma and the kids and the rent, huh - marry some poor dope like -- oh, like Carlos Dominguez - - and get fat and -
Nobody. A boy who works in a grocery.
Good looking?
Mmmyes.
Is he in love with you?
Why do you ask so many questions? What difference does it make how Carlos and I feel? Feeling does not buy clothes and houses!
This is for "mama and the kids."
What about me?
Here is something that should interest Charlie - a stone leopard head made by his ancestors some six hundred years ago. They used it in ceremonies. The jaguar -- in fact all the cat family -- were considered the personification of force and violence in their religious rites.
Well, Charlie, just why do you think your cat didn't kill the Contreras girl?
You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.
Oh, I'm only exploring your theory. Let's take a step further. You drink, don't you, Charlie?
I drink.
Then what do you do?
I sleep it off.
But between the time you leave the cant ma and fall into bed in that old truck of yours, what happens, Charlie?
I don't know.
Now I know I didn't hurt nobody when I was drunk - -
Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
Can't make a buck without my leopard. I tell you, Mr. Manning, you gotta find that cat for me -- or pay up.
Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
You really think so, Charlie?
That cat ain't mean. I feed him out of my own hand for six years. Why don't he kill me? At night in the truck, I let him out of the cage. When I am falling asleep I hear him walking back and forth. I go to sleep. He don't hurt me.
They all say the cat killed this second girl.
They don't say it to me.
I'd like one of them to say it to you, Charlie. I'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. Want to hear them?
Sure.
Where's that man?
Sure, I like my leopards
Sure!
Charlie wasn't drunk last night.
I'm sick.
Here have a cigarette. He was only kidding.
I don't know. I want to see Robles.
What do you want to see him for?
I want him to lock me up.
Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
Two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met
What's left of him.
North -- in an arroyo, Shot through the head - maybe week ago. No good, skin, everything gone 
And here is Three Tree Mesa -- and here I go out of the big arroyo --
It's a blackcard and bad card, but not the card of the cat - not the card of fourfooted things.
I saw Teresa. Maybe I was the last to see her except perhaps her Mamacita and her little brother. I was going past --
) They buried Teresa today and they were hunting the leopard again -- out in the country this time. But they didn't get him.
They're fools. Why don't they let Charlie How-Come hunt it alone. He's an Indian.
What did they say before the bad card came up?
You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.
You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.
Well -- did he give you a lot of money?
Who?
Cut.
Something black - something on its way to you 
Don't look at it!
The death card - -
See you tomorrow -
He will be waiting...
You must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father's grave...
Pedro is waiting for me, too.
Rosita  I have wondered -
What, senorita?
Love is different for different people.
It may sound like music to her -- I can do better with my teeth in a cold Shower. Click  click  click.
She's a local. When the dudes come out to New Mexico, they went to wallow in Latin glamour. This is a bad town for blondes.
Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed - He'll come up with something.
You think be's pretty nice, don't you?
Why not? He's a good press agent and a good friend. Besides, we've shared a lot of headaches 
You're lucky. I wish he'd front page for me.
I mean you being a star and me being just a cigarette girl.
And if you've got cold feet honey, Ill take over for you. That red dress of yours fits just perfect on me.
Oh, dear -- I don't know what I'm going to do without you - honestly, I don't 
Hey  I'm over here.
Oh, Mr. Galbraith! I'm so glad you're here.
Good evening.
You know all about these things - - and I've lived here all my life - and I still don't know what the Procession means.
It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths  that's what this procession is supposed to be.
Oh, that's so interesting!
Show business?
Well, I'd best be off.
It's about the leopard.
You're worrying about its killing someone else?
Yes. I want to go out and patrol the town - be everywhere at once - be sure nothing happens to anybody.
Of course. It's the way any decent man would feel in your position.
You know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back?
There is no danger at all. It's a wild animal. Do you think a wild animal prefers walls, streets and people when it can get into open country?
That's right, of course.
Doc -- something you said the other day --
Yes?
It doesn't jibe with this  you told me the leopard would go out into the country - it wouldn't stay in the city 
Sure -- certainly - but what's that got to do with this?
That's what I don't understand -- why should it come here -- and why didn't it stay here? It's got trees and bushes here -- outside nothing but cement and asphalt.
Jerry, I talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard. This leopard is another matter entirely - - a caged animal travelling around with Charlie How Come for years and years.. That's why it kills human beings.
Why?
It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
But it doesn't eat what it kills.
Just a minute, Robles. Let him go on.
You know Charlie How-Come?
Come to look around?
More or less.
Charlie and I were talking. That's one reason I wanted to see you.
About Charlie's leopard?
Charlie doesn't think the leopard killed the girl in the cemetery.
It could be a man.
There are all sorts of men. You get to see some funny ones as a reporter.
I can understand what you mean - demented men, pathological cases. But what sort of man would kill like a leopard and leave the traces of a leopard?
Some crazy guy.
We had given up digging in a certain barrow. I went back and I tried again. I just had a hunch.
A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
Yes, but what sort of a man?
I don't know.
Come on, Charlie. Let's go find another and better suspect.
Don't you want to see the rest of the exhibit?
You must admit it's possible that it might have been a man.
You know a lot. You've taken a lot of fancy courses in colleges and that kind of stuff - - what kind of a man would kill like that?
But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living.
Yes. There have been men who kill for pleasure -- strange pleasure. There was Blue Beard in France -- Jack The Ripper in London. It's not uncommon.
If there were a man like that, with a kink in his brain around here loose, what would he be like.
To the eye? Like other men.
I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?
He'd act normally when he was with other people. It would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over.
Couldn't you tell a man like that when you saw him?
No. He would be a hard man to find, Jerry. Particularly if he were a clever men. He would go about his ordinary business calmly and coolly except when the fit to kill was on him.
It was you, Galbraith!
No.
It was you.
Not! I tell you. No!
You shot the leopard. We know that. You killed Consuelo. You killed Clo Clo. Then tonight --
I didn't do anything. She screamed. Something frightened her.
Consuelo screamed too -- and Clo Clo. Why did you do it? Why? Quick. Tell me why?
It's better you don't know.
Tell me.
Tormented -- ? Why?
I couldn't rest - I couldn't sleep. All I could see was Teresa Delgado's body -- broken --mangled. I saw it day and night. It was waiting everywhere I turned.
Then you found the leopard --
Jerry told me you were an expert with animals, Mr. Galbraith. Couldn't you tell where it went?
What do you do now?
Why did you give up teaching?
So you see meeting you is a real thrill for me.
Well, I'm hardly Mrs. Leslie Carter whoever she was. In fact, I'm not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on Jerry's little publicity stunt with the leopard.
That was unfortunate.
Well, I'm next. You won't hear anything like that, Mr. Galbraith. I'm not a popular favorite since I let the leopard loose.
I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.
I've disturbed you. I'm sorry -
Of course. Only I'm afraid you'll be cheated. There isn't much of a view of the procession here.
I thought they came right past here 
Wait 
You can go now, Manning. There is no way we can hold you legally responsible.
I haven't done any posse work since last time I rode with Toni Mix at the old Bijou Theatre -- aged six, If you're interested,
Go on foot.
That's why it just mauls and tears at them.
Something's wrong with this whole setup --
Yes, there is something wrong. People who want publicity and don't mind how they get it --what risks they make other people run - - what agony and sorrow they bring to other people --
What are you getting at?
I've been trying to tell him, Sheriff. He won't listen to me.
Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
State hunters?
Yes. The lipstick.
Why?
Chief, don't you understand what this means?
You think Galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse.
Galbraith knows something. He as good as said so 
That's a fact, isn't it?
You won't go to Galbraith with me?
Get it out of here!
Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
Makes no difference. Get him out!
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...
That's easy. Me.
I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!
On his back, I suppose.
No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.
You're too good to me.
Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?
No - not yet.
And I never will- you know what's between us  we're a thing But this is serious competition.
Get it out of here!
Kiki - he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
Makes no difference. Get him out.
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this time.
That's easy. Me.
I thought - is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget.
On his back, I suppose.
No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.
You're too good to me.
Look, Kicks, how long have we known each other?
This is l939. Can't you subtract?
Almost three years, isn't it? And have I ever done anything to hurt you?
No  not yet.
And I never will -- you know what's between us - we're a thing -- But this is serious -- big competition.
Clo-Clo?
You look swell in that threealarm number --
Are you all right?
Suppose I slip them a few bucks  for the funeral expenses.
I suppose he was trying to make me feel bad.
Who was the other man?
I don't know  a witness. He seemed to know something about animals -- you know -- expert testimony.
What did he have to do - look at the body?
Well, does everybody love us now? You've been gone long enough to softsoap twenty editors!
Yeah.
It must be the altitude  you, bucking around the countryside with a lot of bootandsaddle boys --
The whole town's in a state, Kiki doors locked, people huddling together like scared sheep nobody on the streets at night 
Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
Who is he?
 As long as my feet held out.
I can use them.
That was nice of Mr. Galbraith.
Pretty. You know -- it's funny but flowers only mean one thing to me now.
I know. Funerals.
Jerry, these flowers aren't really for me 
You mean you want to take them to the cemetery.
And she waited here for him?
Why do you want to stay around here? It'll only make you feel badly.
Maybe I want to feel badly.
What else do you care about, Kicks?
I'm glad you care about us, Kicks. Sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket --
Confession. I'm a complete softie. I've been conscience-stricken and worried sick ever since that leopard got away --
Kiki -- it wasn't the leopard.
You're positive of that, aren't you?
You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again --
Oh, by the way -- I'm out of cash --
Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?
I got into a little crap game.
As a matter of fact, I'm out of cash myself.
What! You can't be --
I -- I bought some silver jewelry and stuff from Eloise --
Eloise doesn't own enough of anything to make a dent in your pay check, Kicks.
All right, I'm not ashamed of it! I split it two ways 
Half to the Delgado family and half to Clo-Clo's family.
No. No, thanks. Now we've got to do it ourselves.
Kiki?
We stood here once before.
I know -- Teresa -
I hated you that day - you and your flip talk - with that little girl lying dead.
I know. What do you think I felt when you said, "don't be soft?"
Jerry, I want you to be soft. You are soft -- inside - where it matters. I wanted it that day too, but didn't dare tell you.
It's a lovely town - it was until we came and let the leopard loose and all this happened.
Hot... These roads all round here, closed to the public... Whys that? Military bases? Huh. I guess theres space enough for war games... Must be good for business.
Must it?
All those soldiers out there... getting bored, thirsty. Come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps?
Aint nobody out there, Mister.
Nobody? Huh!... How come?
Maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the Getty Museum...
Ha-ha... Yeah... What about that road back there, though? It says closed to the public, doesnt it?
Thats right.
Will you please come with me?
That might depend on where youre going.
I am Lawrence, sir. Mr and Mrs De Moraes majordomo. They are expecting you.
De Moraes? I was asked here by a Mrs Spitz.
Good afternoon. De Moraess residence.
Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
Im afraid they are out at the moment, sir.
When will they be back?
By the way, Laurence, were you here last time your mistresss brother came over? You know, just before he disappeared?
I work here, sir. Im here most of the time.
You wouldnt recall if the brothers-in-law left together, would you?
You will have to ask Mr De Moraes that, sir. Would you like a drink while you wait?
Mrs De Moraes must have taken it hard, eh? Her brothers death.
Now you know why youre here, Mr Lombard. It might be difficult for someone like you to discern, but we are people of a certain standing.
Appearances can be deceptive, Mrs De Moraes.
Three weeks ago. To borrow money. I wasnt here but he got to my husband, sold him some fancy story about an exhibition of his work and needing money to get new prints made. Carlos handed over £1,000 to get rid of him.
And that is the last time any...
What about you, Mrs De Moraes?
I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.
Is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan?
Perhaps it wasnt so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know.
I wont comment on the time but youll understand if I dont tell you to sit down. Now, spare me the apology and get to the point, will you, Mr Lombard.
Im afraid I have bad news, Mr De Moraes. I have reason to believe your brothers in trouble.
For your information, Mr Lombard, trouble is possibly the one thing Leon is capable of getting into all by himself. Though I doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that.
I dont know. He seems to delight in so much sisterly love, he might become determined.
Oh-oh! Touché, Mr Lombard! But tell me, what would you know about sisterly love, eh? No. Dont. You might get confused speaking of things you dont understand and we need you clear- headed, at least until youve done what we are paying you for.
Now you are confusing me, Mrs De Moraes.
Can it be that easy?
Can it be that you want your brother found?
I found this at your brothers.
Disney! How inter...
Its a snuff movie. Prime paedophile material. Im told it retails at around £4,000. I see you dont require a definition.
You... You found that at Leons?
You seem surprised. Could it be you dont think that badly of him after all? You neednt worry. It seems his motives were pure. From what I can make out he bought the boy to rescue him from further abuse.
What... What are you talking about?
Your brother got mixed up with child procurers and tried to make this world a better place, Mrs De Moraes. And having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the exercise. You dont mess around with child procurers. Right now my guess is hes either on the run, held captive, or dead. I understand your misgivings, Mrs De Moraes. But Ive
Excuse me?
I will of course do my best to hang onto it.
Where is it? He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?
I cant tell you that yet. But hes being well looked after.
Oh no. Youll have to do better than that, Mr Lombard.
How dare you... You dont know this tape belongs to my brother, do you, Mr Lombard?
The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.
No. The question now is how long its going to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard.
Excuse me?
Get out of my house. Youre fired, Mr Lombard.
Perhaps I should come back when youre...
Laurence!
The family hired you and I have just fired you, Mr Lombard.
Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time French detective to look for their missing son, Mrs De Moraes?
Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard?
I still dont buy your story but I figured it cant do any harm to let you go on with your enquiry. Besides, if you do turn out to be nothing but a cheap little extortioner, we could always get the right people onto you. I trust you know who I am talking about.
Thank you for coming. Come in and close the door, will you?
You lost my money?
You could say that. And Friedman left this morning for Los Angeles.
Who is Friedman?
The man who sold the boy to your brother.
Im impressed. That information could have cost me £20,000.
Are we understood?
You watched the tape? Friedman and his people dont just provide little kids and videotapes, Mrs De Moraes. Theyre in the import-export business. They run hotels here in London which they probably use as ware- houses and ports of call for their merchandise.
Huh! Really? Hotels?
Minimizes the risks. Children can be moved across borders using reliable businesses. These can also be used to move women and drugs... Anything that makes money really.
You drive a hard bargain, Mr Lombard.
Mr Lombard?
Have you got a pen?
Just a moment... Go ahead.
The Mondrian, room 504. The number is 266 7548, plus the L.A. code...
Are you all right?
Yes... You woke me up... Its the middle of the night here. Have you found Mr Friedman?
Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. Ill give it 24 hours. He just might show up. If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont, all right?
Paul Lamont...?
Mr Lombard. Mrs De Moraes...
Mr Lombard...
How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
When did you get back?
Im really sorry you were not called...
Youre repeating yourself, Mrs De Moraes.
I... Well, were burying Leon tomorrow and... Look, I wish I had more time, but its late and with the funeral...
Arent you curious to know about Friedman?
Black suits you.
Sorry?
Or is it the other way round? The children are needed because you cant satisfy him?
You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...
How did you break into my office, Deborah? Ladies of your standing dont learn to pick locks between shopping trips. Come on, Deborah! Acting dumb doesnt suit you! Who knew Id found dirt on your brother, huh? Who knew it was in an envelope? Taking me for dead, whod want to make sure it didnt fall into the wrong hands?
Youre mad...
Ive had a long and unpleasant day. Im tired and Im angry. But mad? Not yet. I paid Leons boy a visit this morning. Found him alive and well. Why havent you told your husband where he is since reading my note, eh?
Why... I dont know what youre talking about.
You know hed have had him killed, dont you? Does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind, Deborah? Or is it just cold expediency? Could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married?
Have you finished?
You do have a vivid imagination, Mr Lombard. I only wish youd use it fruitfully instead of in being obnoxious. I fail to understand your purpose in this. Still, say what youre owed if you still wish to be paid or get out, all right?
Whatever the reason, Im sorry I did. Goodbye, Mr Lombard. I believe you know your way out.
You knew he had nothing to do with your brothers disappearance, didnt you?
Huh! Dont you recall convincing me he had? You should learn to live with your mistakes, Mr Lombard. There is some merit in it.
I take it you learnt to live with yours then. Take it all the mind-dulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your well-being...
How... When did you...
Tell me, did he kill his little victims too?
What do you mean, No, Mrs De Moraes?
My brother hung himself.
Does the name Pierre Dreyer mean anything to you? Hes a client of mine and a friend of your husband.
Leon hung himself.
Adonis thought your brothers bodyd be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didnt he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...
Leon hung himself...
Leons not found, your parents worry, talk of hiring help to find him, even mention their manhunter friends perhaps... and Adonis panics, takes control, brings me in reckoning a small- time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward, not before Leons found anyhow. He must have kicked himself when he learned Id exceeded his expectations.
Leon hung himself...
I doubt Friedman ever even met Leon, Deborah. Friedman dealt with select customers. As for my envelope, had he know where it was he wouldnt have mistaken me for a hitman called Lamont when we met in Los Angeles.
...You-you spoke to him?
Your brother stumbled upon Adoniss little secret, didnt he? And traded his silence for a kid and some cash. And Adonis fell for it, bought him his kid, sent him away, and then killed him when he came back for more. Leon didnt come here to borrow money for prints. He came to extort a second kids life. Your flunkey let him in, so
If-if my car is there, I could be the one who... Why dont you accuse me of killing my brother?
Kids are not your thing, Deborah. Youd have been ready for me when I turned up with Sleeping Beauty. Damn it! Then too I should have paid more attention. Not Leon, you said. It struck me at the time, but obviously not hard enough. You didnt say My God!, or whatever else well-bred ladies squeak on hearing Uncle Henry misbehaved. Not Leon. Who then?
Leon could still have hung himself.
Youre wrong about my being there, though. Carlos borrowed my car that day, his had broken down... Leon saw it, like you, assumed I was there, thought hed wait to ask for a lift. But Carlos turned up, with the tape you found... Leon got his lift, and accidentally picked up the tape with his photo equipment when he got out. He watched it,
You dont say.
Why did you send me after Friedman? To atone for your sins?
I didnt know my husband and Friedman knew each other. I just... Do you think we spoke about it? Ive known for five years. Hes known Ive known for five years... But not once have we spoken about it. There are things one just doesnt speak about...
One just doesnt... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?
Think what you like. But dont presume to understand.
I dont.
Good.
Is there anything to understand?
Why do I feel I neednt answer that?
Rich. Young. Beautiful. You must at least get a kick out of what he does to his kids.
You bastard...
Five years of it. Surely, youd have divorced him if he disgusted you?
You splendid bastard...
Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
...Were turning in circles.
And you still havent told me why you sent me after Friedman.
Maybe I wanted to give my husband a fright.
A fright?... Five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright?
I didnt know who or what had happened to my brother yet, Mr Lombard!
What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child suppliers being tailed?
Something like that.
Something like that?
Something like that.
What happened? Adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice?
Here we go again.
Where is that?
Simplify and damn.
Dont you believe in simplicity?
Should I?
We all have to like what we become. Cowards included. We achieve this by complicating things a little. But its never that complicated really.
You seem to know what youre talking about.
Perhaps it came to me while dying in a Californian desert because a woman set upon giving her husband a fright got slapped about a little.
My husband didnt need to slap me about, Mr Lombard. I volunteered...
To get me killed...?
I didnt intend it that way... It just happened. He heard from Laurence that youd been back. That wed argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldnt help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
Well, I hope you enjoyed yourself.
You know something? Ive just seen so much ugliness I dont think Id mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time. Id hoped to have a private word with Adonis, but if thats the way you want it.
What are you doing? You cant. I...
Do you think the boy you saved might identify your husband as his purchaser, Deborah? And then, your brothers not buried yet. As I said earlier, an autopsy will...
Do you think wed let him get away with the murder of my brother?
We? You and your parents killed your husband?
They found his body yesterday. In the pool at our house in Sao Paulo. He drowned. Drank too much, went for a swim and drowned.
Your flunkey said he was expected back tonight.
The staff dont know yet... I called my parents, told them everything... I just couldnt take any more...
Get to the point, will you...
So you did talk about it, huh?
On... Once... Once... What are we... you going to do?
What do you suggest?
I dont know. Everyones dead...
Why the hell couldnt you divorce the man?
I... We have to bury Leon tommorrow...
Directory enquiries. Can I help you?
Yes. Im trying to reach a friend but I cant get through. The number is 01766 770 471.
Theres nothing wrong with the line, sir. Are you sure you have the right number? 770 471 is the number of a call box.
A call box? Thats odd. Where exactly?
Penrhyndeudraeth, North Wales.
Good morning, sir. How can I help you?
A coffee and a couple of croissants.
Crow what?
Croissants.
Im sorry, sir. Could you try that again?
The word for those things is croissants.
May I ask where youre from, Mr Lamont?
Europe... France. Im French but I live in London... ... England.
You wouldnt have a cigarette, would you?
Youre sure you wont sit down, Miss Stewart?
Is this some kind of sick stunt? Let me guess. You want money, right?
I cant believe this... Whats coming now, eh? If I dont pay all Hells gonna break loose, is that it?
Well, Id sooner mug an old lady...
Okay. The woman just cant walk away... I want straight answers. No hesitation or I walk for sure. Why cant you go to your Embassy?
Where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why cant you go back there?
The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.
By your Austrian?
You dont know why hes come to Los Angeles? The man you say he killed? Who was he? A colleague of his?
Have you never heard of collect calls, Mr...
Lombard... It will take a few days for the things I need to get here. Meanwhile Id sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog...
There are over 4 million people in this city - why me?
You know where to look for your Austrian, right?
I know where to look.
Thereve been 7 international treaties since 1904 aimed at preventing child slavery. But still no worldwide body dedicated to investigating the maltreatment of children used in sexual exploitation. Officially, its just not called for. Sit down. Can I offer you some coffee?
A recent acquisition. Weve had four break- ins this year alone; files stolen, computers wrecked, faeces smeared on walls. The good guys dismiss us as alarmist do-gooders; the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us. An easy living indeed, Mr Lombard. I got through to Moreau and Jane. I left your landlord out of it. Your flats been broken into. Jane
Hah... What about Nathalie?
No answer. You have no passport and your Embassys out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?
Im sure Ill find a way.
Thank you for the guided tour, but would you mind telling me what were doing here?
How come youre alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do. What am I really looking at here, huh? Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
Its give and take time, Mr Lombard. You need help, we need information. You didnt really expect me to put my ass on the line helping a criminal just for the thrill of it, did you?
A criminal?
Huh... I have no... ... hard evidence...
A little too tight, eh? ...They were my sons. Only thirteen and already six feet tall. A real lanky boy... I... Theres some cold chicken salad in the fridge if youre hungry.
Thank you. But I think Ill go to bed. Its been a long day.
Right... Well, Ill get your money first thing in the morning, okay? Okay. Goodnight then.
Yeah. Goodnight, Emily.
What am I to do with the packages if...
Get a pen and dont ask any questions.
Oh. What... Yeah. Okay.
Route 395. Past Edwards Air Force base and about half a mile before a place called the Red Mountain Motel. Theres a dirt track with a Closed to the public sign. It leads to some kind of ranch in the middle of nowhere. If you havent heard from me by morning send the cavalry, okay? But not before, you hear?
Have you found your man? Is that where he is?
Look, you dont tell me about some Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldnt imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep! What happened? Whos the guy? The Austrian?
What...?
Friedmans dead... They killed him...
So who... Whos the man? Where is he?
Some Italian I picked up back there. Hes in the boot of the Mustang.
Italian? The Mafia...?
No one saw me but the Italian and a dog. I blew up their generator. They thought it was an accident but by now they must have realised one of their party is missing. It might make them feel insecure enough to decide to pack up...
Were both thinking the same thing, right?
Call from the motel and tell him if he moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in acid. Can I have the keys to your house?
That-that wont do. Thats not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, thats the way...
Im finished here and Im tired, Emily. You shouldnt be here. Now dont make it worse.
A seminar in a baby breeding farm! Bodies in acid! You think Ill get anywhere with that? Jesus! With luck I might raise a laugh. They might even send a patrol car to check the place out. Whatever, itll be too late.
Then find another way.
Damn it! You cant fucking walk away from this!
...Im Emily Stewart. The hysterical female who sees evil everywhere since the day her thirteen year-old boy disappeared. The pain in the ass who cries wolf at the drop of a hat. However I go about this thats who I am. Do you get what Im fucking saying, Mr Lombard?
What about your friendly cop?
Theyd never let me go. And youd end up in more trouble than you know for helping me.
You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.
Nothing sticks to slime, Emily. This should cover what you lent me.
Whitney Armstrong, my deputy. What Whitneys trying to say is that you might not live to tell the tale next time you meet your Austrian...
Hi...
If you have hard evidence about a child trafficker, we want it, Mr Lombard. And we want it before you get yourself killed...
Weve still got the Italian...
Look at him, Whitney. Come all the way from England to clean up California. Huh!
Emily...
Shit! Fuck! Whats fucking wrong with people! Im going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to!
Im calling about the puppies.
Have we done business before?
I saw the ad at Georges. Im passing through town and Im in a hurry.
May I have your phone number?
Why?
What sort of puppy are you looking for?
What sort have you got?
Pups. Bitches. From three to twelve months. Trained and untrained ones. White and brown ones. You understand?
Yeah.
We also provide 24-hour after-sale service. Were the puppy to fall sick or accidently die, we would unburden you, you understand?
Yes... Good, good...
So, what are you looking for?
What about an untrained pup, white...
How much of a hurry are you in?
Tomorrow?
Im afraid the only pups currently available at such notice are brown and trained. But they are all very cheerful and have been thoroughly checked for diseases...
I see. How much?
Fifteen for a straight delivery. Twenty with the provision of a safe place. Visitors tend to find the second option more convenient.
... Fine. Ill go for the safe place.
On the bed!
Where is the Austrian?
Youre not playing with little boys now, scumbag. Where is the Austrian?
Who are you?
Where is the Austrian? Is Friedman the Austrian?
Yes. Friedmans the fuckin Austrian!
Where is he?
I dont know. Hes gone! Hes gone. I dont fucking know where, I swear... Hes gone. On holiday...
...On holiday?
Whos the money man?
Ever seen him before?
No... No... I swear...
Whats this place? A hotel of some kind?
Yeah... The Diplomat.
Where?
What?
Where are we?
Finsbury Park. Were in Finsbury Park.
Where are the kids?
What kids?
There were six on offer, you scumbag. Where are the other five?
I dont know... This is just a delivery place, man! I swear I dont know where the kids are... I work for Martin, thats all. Martin knows. He works for Friedman. He knows...
And who does Friedman work for?
The company. We all work for the company.
What company?
I dont know. I dont know, man. I dont even know Friedman that well... I... Man, youve got to get me out of here...
How many of you scumbags are here?
Just me... Martins gone back to the Ambassador. Look...
Whats the Ambassador?
Another hotel. Down the road. Martin lives there. He took your money. Hes got a safe... I need a doctor...
What about the staff? Theyre in on whats going on, arent they? How many of them?
What colour is your car? What colour is your car?
B-Black...
Where is it?
Im sorry but Mr Gluck is not answering, sir. Would you like to leave a message?
The Hyatt. Good afternoon. May I help you?
Does Mr Gluck call for his messages?
Absolutely, sir. As a matter of fact he called this morning, sir.
Next time he calls tell Mr Gluck he better be there to take his calls at 9 tonight or at 9 in the morning if he cares about his puppies. Got that?
You sure you passed on my message?
Hello again, neighbour. I didnt intrude, did I?
How are you, Jane?
Fine. How was the match? Did you loose?
No.
Must be your lucky day then. Ive got your accounts - you dont owe much tax for last year.
Good.
Have you heard of a French film called La Collectionoose?
La what?
La collectionoose. Its about a young girl in the south of France who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her. Its on TV tonight and as Im in I thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and... The review says its about the conflict between intellect and instinct. And witty. The directors supposed to be famous. Rommel
Should I?
I dont know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many.
So you havent seen the film, then?
Its Friday night, Jane. What happened to your latest boyfriend?
Oh... We split up.
Well, I hope youre not too heartbroken and...
Ive got work tonight, Jane.
Shes pretty... See you, huh?
I came to feed your fish. I didnt know...
Oui, bonjour, Jean... Oui, très bien, merci. Dites-moi, pourriez-vous me dire si vous avez recommandémes services àquelquun récemment... Vous êtes certain... Non, non... Je vous remercie...
Hello there. Hows the flat. I cleaned...
Jane, there was an envelope in my desk. The one Id given you and then got back, remember? I cant find it. Do you know where it is?
No... I told you on the phone. Whoever broke in messed-up all your papers. I put everything back where I thought it ought to be. Maybe its there with...
Its not.
Piss off!
Just ask if they can recall recommending my services to anyone in the recent past. Say youre my secretary, all right?
Your secretary, huh!
Id appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you cant, dont worry about it. Ill call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but Im in a hurry.
Hello, Jane. Its me.
Really? And how are you, eh? Someone called Pierre Dreyer said that a month ago he had dinner with a Brazilian friend of...
Carlos De Moraes?
Yes. How did...
Good afternoon, Mrs...?
May I...?
Lombard, this is not a Jewish name, is it?
I hope its not too significant.
What if it is?
Whatever, you come recommended. We...
Recommended?
Must I speak to you in French?
Didnt you say I came recommended? Thats what I thought. May I know by whom?
You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.
Okay. Recommended...
Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?
Look Mrs Spitz... I dont know to whom Im indebted for the recommendation but... Im not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references. What I do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not I can be of help. I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs Spitz.
I take it your son is called Leon?
What do you think has happened to your son, Mrs Spitz?
You wouldnt be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.
How did you do that, Mrs Spitz?
Do what, Mr Lombard?
Check with your sons bank. Banks dont usually give out information about their customers.
I said earlier that my husband and I are supporting Leonard in his photography, Mr Lombard. By this I mean that since his return from America I have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold. So as you see, I did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account.
I didnt mean to imply you did, Mrs Spitz.
Then you should not have sought an explanation.
I presume you checked your sons apartment...
Yesterday. It all looked normal.
Did you look for his passport, driving licence?
Leonard does not hold a driving licence. As for his passport, I do not know where he keeps it.
So he could have decided to go on a trip...
He could indeed, Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it.
I take it your son is not married, Mrs Spitz?
No. And before you ask, no, hes not gay! He has had girlfriends, but nothing serious...
Any friends?
The proprietor of his workplace is the only friend of his we know about. His address is in this envelope with Leonards address, keys and other things you might need.
Im sure... As far as you know, when and where was your son last seen?
The £1,000 is on account.
My rates...
We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention.
Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?
My husband and I will be leaving tomorrow for a short stay in Israel. Deborah will be here if you need anything before our return.
£10,000 a year to the girl for as long as she looks after the boy?
Look at it this way. He might achieve everything your son never did.
What happens now?
The rooms yours for 24 hours. Its sound- proofed, stocked up with food, drink and other things you might find useful. You can do anything you like.
Anything at all?
Vous êtes Français?
Problems?
Is my money in there?
Lets go.
I dont know what your problem is, but...
Am I supposed to know him?
Six weeks ago. He bought a boy of yours.
Clients come and go.
This one came back and was never seen again. I understand Friedman looked after him.
Where is Friedman?
Friedman lives with you at the Ambassador?
No. In Hampstead... Why?
This car needs petrol.
Youre out of your mind. Whats the idea?
Is it real? You people are sick.
Huh. Id have thought a tough guy like you would know better. The sick ones are out there, friend. They make up the clientèle. Get rid of them and were out of business.
Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.
Maybe I dont.
Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who cant do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines.
Im overcome by your public-spiritedness.
You know what, Martin? I ought to tie you down with your old arse up in the air and advertise the hole in the middle of it to the world. Free. And hope you never die.
Huh... Im sure thered be lots of takers.
Is this Friedman?
Who are you? Who are you working for, huh?
Is this Friedman, Martin? Come on, scumbag. Youve reached your sell- by date. Tell me if this is Friedman, where he is in Los Angeles and what name hes using?
Youre making a mistake, tough guy. Whoever he is, your guys not one of Friedmans...
You seem very sure about that.
I told you... The rabble, its me... Huh... Its sad.
What is?
Trying to say something, Martin?
Hyatt... Friedmans... at the Hyatt...
The Hyatt...? Whats that?
Its about the puppy. You got the money?
Yeah.
At what time will you be available?
Three oclock.
What is it?
This is the hotel supervisor, Mr Lamont. Im terribly sorry to disturb you but theres been a mix-up with our bookings which you might be able to help us resolve.
What are you talking about?
Five to three. Youre early.
I gather weve done business with a friend of yours?
Have you?
The person who put us in touch seems to think so.
Your lady friend did.
And while visiting our fair city you... An Austrian?
An Austrian.
An Austrian... Not much to go on, is it?
Will you be alone? The merchandise. Is it just you or...
Ill be alone.
Evening. Table for one?
No. Thank you. Could you tell me if Leon Spitz is here, please?
Leon? No. Im afraid he left.
Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...
No. I meant he left as in no longer works here.
Oh. This is... Wed arranged to meet tonight and Im due to return to Paris tomorrow...
Im sorry...
This is private property. The public footpath is back to the left of the bridge.
Its wet. Will this do?
Wheres your wallet? Have you got a wallet?
Is this some kind of mugging? Because...
Shut up! Wheres your wallet?
In my jacket. Left inside pocket.
A private investigator... Youre not Austrian?
Should I be?
Whats a French private investigator doing here?
Can I get up now?
No! What do you want here? How do you know me?
As you know from speaking to Phil, your friend Leon has disappeared, Rhian. His family have hired me to find him.
...Leons not here. How did you get here? Phil doesnt know where I live.
Well, I obviously do. And I also know that Leons not here, Rhian. But I thought that you might know where I should look for him.
You thought wrong. I havent seen Leon for months.
Havent you? Then why the worried messages on his answering machine, Rhian? Id have sworn you expect him to be in trouble.
What are you going to do now? Call the police? Take him away? I must warn you hes terrified of men, so...
We didnt quite make it as lovers... Leon is a good man, though...
Did Leon tell you why he didnt want the police involved, Rhian?
He just said he had good reasons.
Good reasons?
Thats what he said. I tried to dissuade him... Told him I couldnt take on another child, that hed get into trouble... I mean, people who sell children... But he wasnt listening... I guess he finally found himself a crusade... His family think hes back on drugs, eh? Huh... Leon did drugs. A lot of drugs. Went through his self-destruct phase, you know? Things
His mother would be pleased to hear that.
Yeah... But he didnt beat the demons... A quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through his parents leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims.
Im afraid I dont understand.
Theyre German Jews. Came here before the war. They both lost all their families in extermination camps, but they themselves never went near one. The idea that his family wealth was started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has been haunting Leon. Its not guilt, more of a curse... And then theres something about his parents being involved with Nazi
Do you know Leons parents names?
Who else knows about the boy?
My sister... She lives in the next valley.
Is she on the phone?
I cant think of a good reason for it - for now anyway. My number if anything happens. Whats your sisters number?
And you better stop greeting strangers with a shotgun. If Leons Austrian was looking for you I reckon hed have found you before I did.
Im sorry. Its just you dont look local...
No sick people in the country, huh?... Just tell me one thing, Rhian. Leons story about the boy? You just took his word for it?
Whats the date?
The nineteenth... How come you didnt know?
Ive been away. Did Leon speak to you about his sister?
Er... Yes...
Did he ever refer to the hostility between them?
The money Leon left for the boy, was it cash?
Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...
Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work?
... No.
You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?
He showed me a book with a picture of a couple caught kissing in a street...
Hows the boy doing?
Fine...
And you aint neither one of those damned Mexicans who end up littering the landscape after getting ripped-off by their friendly cross- border guides, are you, mister?
No...
Now, can you stand up? Can you use your legs and stand up?
I... How long have I been here?
Huh... I guess you aint quite ready for civilisation yet... Ill give you one more day, a meal, and then youre on your way.
Los Angeles?
Los Angeles is 100 miles away.
Id appreciate it if I could use your phone.
Barstows 30 miles to the left. Los Angeles a hundred to the right. Wherever youre heading, I reckon somebodyll pick you up.
Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesnt appeal to you...
Welcome to the club.
Excuse me?
I hear youre looking for Leon. That makes me, his old-lady, and now you, looking for the little bastard. Leons gone, man. Vanished. You interested in his photographs?
Uh-huh.
No shit... Well, Im afraid I cant help you.
I take it you dont know where he is, then?
Huh! You could always try Suicide Bridge. You dont know Leon, do you?
I know his work better than I know him.
Let me put it this way then; the photographs and the man? One and the same, man, one and the same. At best fucking weird, at worst fucked-up fucking weird. Maybe you should think yourself lucky. Some folks just aint worth getting involved with. And Leon sure is one of em.
What about his girlfriend?
What about which girlfriend?
Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.
Oh. Thatd be Rhian, a Welsh chick he used to lay at weekends. She got wise and dumped him months ago...
Would you know where I might reach her?
Yeah! Somewhere in Wales. I dont really know her. Used to turn up in a Transit van on weekends, sell old furniture at Camden. Thats how come he only laid her at weekends, ha ha...
Could that be Camden Market?
Yeah. Why? Youre going to look for her... Shit! You really think his pictures are that good?
Quest-ce que tu veux?
Whats an hour of your time worth these days, Nathalie? Combien, Nathalie!
Cinq cents.
Jai bien peur quil te faudra attendre. Pas avant la matinée.
Bye. And thanks... Nathalie gently closes the door, eyes Lombard who shakes himself awake... rolls her eyes and surveys the room...
Où est passé ton salon?
Mon bureau coûtait trop cher.
Alors?
Alors quoi?
Le montage, lemballage. Not your regular street muck, is it? This is collectors stuff. How much would it cost me?
A lachat, trois ou quatre mille. En location, cinq cent. Mais ça pourrait faire plus. Je ne sais pas. Cest pas vraiment mon truc. I dont know any Austrian, Xavier.
But maybe you know someone who does. An Austrian, in London, dealing in kids and snuff videos. How many can there be? These people supply to order. He has to be known, reachable.
Then why dont you reach him?
We are so alike, Xavier. Still, sometimes I wonder which one of us is the ugliest.
Okay, shitbag. Im only going to ask you this once. Where is Friedman?
Who? I dont know who the fuck youre talking about, sunshine.
Gluck.
Figlio di puttana. Youre the French asshole who bumped off the London guys...
Five seconds. Then you die.
Fuck...
Three...
Youre the lantern man, huh? If you wanna see whats left of him...
The acid bath?
Why did you kill Friedman?
Let me give you a tip, asshole - no one pulls stunts like what you pulled in London and here tonight and hopes to get away with it. It upsets people. Its wrong. Fucking wrong.
Why did you kill him?
Huh! You turned him into a liability, didnt you know?
Nice way to help a colleague in trouble.
Are you telling me Friedman didnt tell you I was here looking for him?
If he had, youd be dead.
So why didnt he?
What do you think, huh?
I think youd rather not know what I think.
Huh. Maybe he figured the news our London bureau got a visit from a hitman on behalf of a pissed off client wouldnt go down too well. He only shared his guilty secret last night. And then only cause he was so fucking edgy after calling his hotel we persuaded him to talk.
So you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room... How did Friedman say he got to know where to find me?
Try again, and this time be polite.
I can only tell you what he told us...
Not even scum like Friedman would go to the trouble of killing a stranger on the strength of one anonymous call.
Some guy called to let him know the Frenchman whod called the night before he left London was in L.A. looking to kill him. He did his sums and decided to take the call seriously.
What sums?
Two stiffs and a missing kid followed your visit to one of the London hotels. He didnt need your confession...
Youre sure he said his caller was a man?
When they realise Im missing...
What you gonna do? Kill me?
Dont tempt me. The last scumbag who thought I might kill him died soon afterwards.
Moreau? Cest moi. Alors...
Salut, Laurent. Ouais. It wasnt easy but I got what you wanted through Interpol. Say, whats your business with these Spitzes?
They lost their son. Why?
It appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known as Never Forget. Over the years were talking about a dozen or so execution-type killings.
Are they still operative?
Their last suspected kill occurred two years back, though your Spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group. Still, Id watch my step. These people are well-connected, Laurent; former Israeli prime minister, etc. The ladys also president of an international Zionist organisation... Anyway, you get the picture.
Mossad?
Ha ha... Yes. With prices reaching an all time low, the name of the game has become have-it- where-its-at... As we all know, transportation has always been the costliest and trickiest part of this business...
Cost what?
Costliest!
Whats that? A word?
What do you think?
I dont know. Could be the sound of jewellery hitting a parquet floor, huh?
Very funny. Can I go on now?
Oh dear, why is life so complicated? Sometimes I really wish I could be someone else.
That's a good idea, sire.
What do you mean?
Let someone else pretend to be you, and see if...
Why not you -- Jean d'Aulon? The only man who's poorer than I am, and so the only man I can trust. Dignified, honorable, wise... what more could we ask of a king?
My dear Aulon, to you it shall befall the honor of impersonating the royal blood!
Majesty, I can't...
Why, are you not ready to die for your king?
Of course I am, it's just that...
Sire, you know how bad I am at this sort of game.
Jeanne, this is -- in fact -- my loyal friend and finest archer, Jean d'Aulon. Jean... I place her in your care. Find her suitable lodgings -- here -- in the castle... and guard her with your life.
Here... to help pay Jeanne's ransom. All the Captains gave what they could, as well as the citizens of Orleans and the other towns she saved...
Very generous of you all. How much?
My dear Aulon... That's fine...
It's a miracle she's not dead!
We have to do something before she tries it again! I beg of you, my lord, don't let her down... let me organize an escape...
Jean, it's... it's not so easy...
But not impossible... Gilles and La Hire are ready to risk everything to save her...
Jean... me dear, loyal Jean... why do you want to oppose the will of God? Jeanne wanted to go to Compiegne -- we let her -- she got caught. Then, on my personal orders, Regnault proposed 30,000 crowns for her ransom, and once again the answer was no. And now you say she tried to escape, and the answer is still no. Jean, open
What do you fear most now... my sword? ... or his hands?
Listen, please accept my apologies for... you know, me pretending to be the... well it wasn't really my idea... well, yes it was my idea but...
I would like some fresh straw.
And I would like to see a priest.
Now?
Yes. I didn't confess today.
I shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner.
Now?
Better today than tomorrow.
I also need someone who can read and write.
This I can do. I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.
I thought you were an archer?
Yes, I am. I'm an archer who can read and write. Who do you want to write to?
Who do they think I am?!
Jeanne, calm down. You can't blame the people -- they've been hearing all about you for weeks.
Jeanne, stop it!
He didn't tell you to cut all your hair off...!
How dare you tell me what God tells me to do!
What did they say?
Uh... they said... they will think about it.
Good.
What's going on?!
Not so... easily. Why aren't you... fighting...? go on... we're almost there...
Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...
Alright... I promise to rest if you promise... to go back to the battle.
The king said you're his finest archer...?
Well...
Jeanne, calm down, do you hear me? Are you alright?
Yes...
I'll go.
Jeanne...! Are you alright?
Yes. Yes, I'm fine... We need more brushwood! Why are you staring at me like that?
Jeanne... the king has ordered us not to ride with you anymore.
They've abandoned me... like everyone.
What... what do you mean?
It's been weeks since they spoke to me. Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...
Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it's a sign to go home?
It's not time yet. My mission is not over yet. There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.
Well of course they're me! That's how God talks to me. If you listen hard enough, even you can hear him. Everyone can hear him.
But I hear so many voices... one voice saying one thing, another voice saying the opposite -- love your enemy, kill your enemy -- what is good, what is evil...?
All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
I don't know it. I feel it.
You make it sound so simple...
The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.
Me?! It's not me, it's God who makes everything complicated! If he's all-powerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place? And why let this war go on for a hundred years? And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family? Why, why?!
So... even you don't believe in me anymore...
If you really want to help me, there's one thing you can do.
Tell me...
That's not what I asked... Why do you want to marry me?
What did the king say?
He said that... he's making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and...
It's a trap! They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England!
Did your voices tell you that? You told me you hadn't heard them for months...
No, but...
Or maybe it's Jeanne who's in a trap -- her own trap -- a downward spiral that she can't stop?
Did you come back to marry me or to insult me?
I will ask my voices... if they come back one day. Meanwhile... I'm going to Compiegne.
Jeanne... I believe in you -- but can you believe in me for once? Don't go... even if you don't want to marry me.
I would like to marry you. But I have already promised myself... to God.
But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne?
But it is what I want.
To be killed in battle?
Will you at least let me stay with you?
We must sound the retreat!
Get back inside the town and see if the English are attacking from the other side!
But... why... what's the point?
Do as I say!
I want to stay with you...
I am ready now...
Just give me a moment and then you'll be free...
I'm already free...
My gentle Captain... I'm staying.
I -- I don't understand...
One day you will.
... and maybe the king will give you some money, and a little land, and a title even... ... wouldn't that be a fine thing? You, a lady of title!
I'm staying, Jean.
No, you must come, Jeanne -- we need you -- so much has happened since you left... I have a new horse now, a white one, just like yours... and La Hire hardly swears at all anymore... You can't stay -- they'll burn you!
I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me...
Jeanne's alive!
Good.
We have to press home the attack!
Sound the retreat...
But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
I made no such promise. Sound the retreat for the night!
But that was her order!
I won't tell you more about that. I'm more afraid of displeasing Him than not answering you...
You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!
No...
Did God forbid you to tell the truth?
Go onto the next question.
Good advice for the French, not for the English! Do you think God hates the English?
Is it true that you launched an attack on Paris?
I tried to.
It was on a Sunday, wasn't it?
I don't remember. Maybe.
Do you think is was a good idea to launch an attack on a holy day?
I don't know...
And didn't you order the citizens of Paris to surrender the city in the name of the King of Heaven?
No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...
I can't read.
Ah, yes, I forgot... God sent us an illiterate peasant to carry out such an important mission! Do you think that God made the right decision, to take an ignorant girl to save the kingdom of France?
Do you have a sword?
Quite a few.
Didn't you also carry a banner?
Yes...
Which did you prefer, your banner or your sword?
I was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword.
And why was that? Did it have some particular value or power?
No, it's just... a sword is a weapon.
And?
And so I... I prefer my banner.
Why?
To avoid killing anyone.
No, of course not... I never killed anyone...
Then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger... too strong perhaps...?
No! I warned the English to go back home -- I begged them not to force us to fight -- they knew the defeat I would bring on them... why didn't they listen to me?
We have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner...
Yes, probably... maybe...
So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
Yes, but...
Did you use the sword that you held in your hand?
No, I... I held it up to...
You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?
Yes, maybe... I don't remember...
... so you were in the middle of the battlefield, with your sword in your hand, waving it above your head... charging against the enemy, screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone?
It is the sacred place that matters, Charles -- not the size. Am I correct, Bishop?
I don't understand... the holy oil of Clovis... it was quite full the last time I saw it...
And when was that?
Well... at the coronation of King Charles VI...
Thirty years ago? I'm not surprised it's gone...
W-w-what are you doing?!
Arrest them!
What are you doing? This is an ecclesiastical court -- you have no right to do this!
Who's running this trial, you or her? I can't believe it! This wretched girl -- how dare she speak to us like that?
I understand your impatience, but if you want this trial to be acknowledged as legal we must follow correct procedure and...
To hell with procedure! We paid a bloody fortune for this slut, and we can do whatever the hell we like with her, whether the church likes it or not -- is that clear?
But if this trial seems fixed, I fear you'll have the very opposite result to the one you want...
We want her burned as a witch!
But in order to do so, the church must first prove her heresy, or else you'll be burning a martyr...
Calm down, my lord, I beg you!
How can I calm down when I'm made the laughing-stock of the whole court?! I've had enough!
Be patient, my lord... you've seen how it is. This girl has a way with people... but everyday we're making progress...
It is not for us to burn her, my lord. That is your prerogative.
... and your prerogative is to find her guilty...
But we can't do that unless she admits to blasphemy...
You won't be able to drag anything from her that way. You also must realize that many of my colleagues are... well, scared...
Scared of a girl?
Whose side are you on, Cauchon?
I'm on the side of our Mother Holy Church. Besides, a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt.
So... here is the famous Jeanne... Savior of Orleans... terror of the English? You look pretty ordinary to me...
Am I... am I dead?
Dead you're worthless, darling.
Where... where am I?
My king will pay any ransom you ask.
Your king? Ah yes, of course... What's he going to pay me with? Cows? Chickens? I prefer gold, and the English have plenty. I wonder how much they'll pay... to have the Witch of Orleans in their clutches? Those English are so arrogant, they can't accept the idea of being defeated by a peasant girl... it has to have been the devil's work.
God defeated the English, not me.
Are you alright? Did they hurt you?
No no, I'm fine, really...
Really?
Quick -- hide in here...
What about you?
Don't worry about me -- just stay in here... and don't move!
But where are you going to be?
Oh, thank you Lord! I'm so glad to see you! I need to confess... I haven't been confessed since Easter... or been to Mass... Will you hear me now?
I will hear you... but not now, not here.
Who are you?
Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais. As you were captured in my diocese, the duty of conducting the trial falls upon me.
Trial? What trial??
Your trial, Jeanne. On a charge of heresy.
But... the King -- my king -- didn't he pay my ransom?
It seems that the English care more about you than the French.
The English??
Take the Holy Gospels in your hand and swear to tell the whole truth concerning everything you will be asked.
You will swear to tell the truth about whatever you are asked.
You must take the oath! Not even a king, would refuse to take an oath to tell the truth in a matter of faith.
So... begin by telling us your name -- assuming you're allowed to tell us that much?
Show us a little more cooperation first. Where were you born?
In a village called Domremy.
How old are you?
Nineteen... or thereabouts...
Were you baptized?
Yes. In the church at Domremy.
Recite the Lord's Prayer.
Jeanne, listen to me very carefully. We are all men of faith, and we shall earnestly strive for the salvation of both your soul and body as though it were our own. We do so in the name of our Holy Mother Church, who never closes her arms to those who would return to her. But we cannot help you unless you submit to
Jeanne -- be careful -- you're not helping yourself by refusing to submit to our judgment...
Jeanne, you are not helping yourself. If you don't answer our questions properly, your refusal will be taken into account.
These questions have nothing to do with your trial.
I assure you they do. So... answer me... when was the last time you heard this voice?
Not long ago...
When exactly? A day, a week -- when?
What were you doing when the voice came?
Praying.
The voice was in your cell?
Yes.
What did it tell you?
Many things...
Tell us, Jeanne... do you often hear this voice?
Yes...
Let me clarify things for you, Jeanne. On the one hand there is the Church Triumphant, that is to say God, his saints, and the souls that are saved. And then there is the Church Militant, that is to say our Holy Father the Pope, the cardinals, the prelates of the Church, the clergy, and all good Catholic Christians. Moreover this Church, when assembled,
It is for us to determine whether you are a good Christian, not you.
Jeanne, I beg of you... sign! In God's name, don't you understand? I'm trying to save you! If you don't sign, the English will burn you to death! Is that what you want??
Sign this, and I will confess you myself if you want.
And may I go to Mass?
Please... may I have it back...
I didn't mean it! I didn't know what I was signing! You tricked me...!
I don't understand, Jeanne... why did you do it? Why?
And you? Why did you lie? You promised I could be confessed...
I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!
I ask only one thing... to hear me in confession...
Good day, sir. I trust my honorable Duke of Burgundy is feeling well?
He's feeling wonderful.
Thanks be to God.
And your Duke? The Duke of Bedford?
Not so well, I regret to say. This business with the Maiden... it's caused him endless grief and torment. That's why he's entrusted me with the task of... shall we say...
Buying her?
This word is -- regrettably appropriate for the situation. In fact what we -- the Church -- wish to do is determine whether or not this girl is sent by God, as she claims. You understand that we cannot allow just anybody to abuse God's name in this manner...
20,000?! But... I heard King Charles was... financially embarrassed.
Your health and happiness has always been my first concern, Charles... ever since you were a little boy -- and I think I know you better than your own mother...
You think?
Mmmm. Yes. I know for example the sickness that plagues your heart. I know how painful it is for you... to have loved a father... without ever knowing if he really was yours.
W-w-what has that got to do with this Maiden?
Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions?
You really think she's been sent... by God?
You will??
It's true. There's only one king... people need to be reminded of that. Nevertheless... Jeanne has done so much for us...
I assure you, Charles, the Maiden has no greater admirer than myself. But whatever our personal feelings, we cannot allow her to conduct her own private war. For the sake of the kingdom, it is imperative that you stop her going to Compiegne...
Don't worry, Charles. If God is still with her, she will be victorious. We're not her judges... we're just spectators. Let her go to Compiegne, as you let her go to Orleans, and let God decide her fate.
But... her army's so small now...
There's no need to be afraid, sire.
I'm... I'm not the king...
What was my mission? To help my country? But how could I do that? I was only a poor girl who knew nothing about riding or making war... so I decided to wait and not to speak to anyone about it.
You did well...
... and what... what did he say?
I don't need lodgings if we're to be marching on Orleans...
Ah, Jeanne... come here...! This whole coronation idea of yours is a fiasco... nothing is ready...
... You look wonderful...
Get them out of here!
Now hold on -- you're not captain here... on the battlefield perhaps, but not in the royal bedchamber!
Why did you betray me? Paris was ours for the taking! All I needed was another few hundred men... Why did you take back the army you gave me?
Gave you? Well now, I wouldn't quite put it like that...
So how would you put it?
Well... we are, of course, enormously grateful for your past efforts, but your task is done. Now it's time for negotiation... and after many months of skillful work, our dear Tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our Burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the English. You see, my dear Jeanne... as it is written in the Bible, "to
Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
She pretends she's been sent by God! These charlatans -- it's a pity there isn't enough wood to burn them all!
She says she'll be here tomorrow...!
You mustn't see her, my lord. We know nothing about her... we don't even know if she is from Lorraine.
What difference does it make where she comes from?
Not exactly. She wants you to give her an army -- at your expanse. Bearing in mind that your mother stole every last piece of gold in the treasury, I fail to see how you can afford such an adventure.
I can see her if I want to. I mean, with half of France in the hands of the English, what have I got to lose?
Your majesty, I urge you not to see this woman. It all reeks of a Burgundian trap!
My astrologers assure me that the hour is p-p-propitious -- Leo, with Virgo rising. Have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the Virgin is next to the Lion?
Supposing she's an assassin?
Your majesty, I really think you...
My dear loyal Tremoille, I know I can count on you...
... as always, majesty...
My captains have sworn their support.
He's probably right -- let's call a delay...
There's no time, sire -- we can't hold up the ceremony... there's no telling when the English might come back... they're only ten leagues away...
I... I don't know... it'll sound like we... betrayed her...?
When you saw your king for the first time, was there an angel over his head?
If there was, I didn't see it...
Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
You told us about the appearance of this... voice. What exactly did you see? Part of it... or all of it?
His face.
Does he have hair?
Yes.
Is it long and hanging down?
I'm more interested in what he says, not what he looks like.
But if the devil were to take on the physical appearance of a saint or an angel... or a man... how would you recognize him? By what he said?
Go on to the next question.
5,000 gold crowns.
That's not a lot.
It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings. His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.
I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.
May I, without offending you, inquire how generous?
8,000. We can't raise more... We can only place ourselves at the mercy of your generosity.
Were you sent by Lord Dunois?
Yes... they were.
Good. Where are the English?
Everywhere. Where is the food?
It's coming -- I rode on ahead. I have to speak with the Captain of the English army... his name's Talbot...
I know...
Good. Can you bring me to him?
Wait, wait...
For what?
Because... because -- I mean -- the English have a broad sense of humor, but... I mean, you don't understand... to them you're a witch, working for the devil. What makes you think they'll listen to you?
Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!
Well. I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.
You may have been with your counsel, but I've been with mine, and I'm telling you, God's counsel is wiser than yours, and he's telling me to speak to the English -- now!
So... what is the message?
Jeanne, that really makes no sense at all. The Tourelles is virtually impregnable... besides, if we're on the other side of the river attacking the Tourelles, what's to stop Talbot attacking the city from the north?
You know, I feel a great sorrow for you, because you're laughing now, but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of God.
Jeanne, with respect -- we can't just attack the Tourelles like that -- it's a very complicated matter and...
"Be patient, be patient"... is that the only advice you can ever come up with?? I've shown more patience than a dozen saints!
Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl.
Ah, so that's it. To you I'm just a girl.
Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?
Dunois... was it you who ordered the attack? Answer me?!
Can we -- uh -- discuss this later?
Position the long-bows over there, crossbows over there -- and set up Dijon Culverins either side of those trees...
The wind will be against us...
What's going on?
Jeanne, what are you doing with that... you've got it back to front...
Stand by with the battering-rams...
We need another ten minutes...
Well...? Shall we go?
Not yet.
My lord Dunois... I have wonderful news! -- finally -- he's sending her to us -- thanks be to God -- we're saved -- it's wonderful!
Calm yourself, Xaintrailles. Now slowly. Who has finally done what?
The Dauphin -- he's sending us food -- and supplies -- and an army -- led by Jeanne -- the maiden from Lorraine -- isn't it wonderful?!
Yes, it's a miracle.
And it's not the first one! They say she saved a little boy who was dying of...
But... don't you think we should at least... go and... welcome her?
Brilliant idea... but to be really effective, why not send a whole army of virgins?
God... why of course -- we'd forgotten about him! Strange, I don't seem to remember seeing him at Agincourt.
Damn right!
I do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked!
There must be something we can do for her for Chrissakes!
Yes. We can pray.
This is no good!
And... what does Jeanne think?
We return to Orleans... across the bridge, at the Tourelles.
But the bridge has been pulled down!
Clear?
You look disappointed... Isn't this what you wanted?
No... not like this...
Jeanne... let him do it. One more dead body's not going to make any difference, so who cares?
Bravo! What about all the other hundreds of prisoners? Do we let them go too?
Jeanne... The men are exhausted!
I know, but so is the enemy -- they're falling back -- Paris is ours...!
Jeanne... we're not enough...
So... bring up the reinforcements!
Right behind us -- Dunois with another then thousand men!
Jeanne, look behind you.
Do you know how to count?
Of course I do? Bring them up!
Jeanne... that is not ten thousand reinforcements -- that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers.
But... where is Dunois... where are the men the king promised me?
He never sent them... Don't you understand? He doesn't want this war anymore... he has his crown now, that's all he ever wanted...
But my voices... they promised me...
Who told you to wear men's clothes?
The clothes are not important...
You also cut your hair short like a man, and in the Bible it clearly states that it is an abomination for a woman to pretend to be a man! It proves your desire to deceive...
It was just... more convenient as I was among soldiers...
So you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man?
I... submit to Our Lord.
But will you also submit to the decision of the Church?
Tell us, Jeanne... why did you jump from the tower at Beaurevoir?
I had been sold to the English. I'd rather die than fall into their hands.
Did your voice tell you to jump?
No...
So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?
No...!
How can you deny it when you just said "I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English"...?
That's now what I meant...
Do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin? No one is allowed to destroy the life that God created!
I know, but that's not the way things happened...
You mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?
Yes, but...
And you didn't jump of your free will?
No!
Stop it! What are you doing?
Nothing... just taking his teeth.
But you can't just kill a man for his teeth!
Why not? He has good teeth...
Besides, what about these...?
Yeah...
So who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river??
Hey, my friend! I'm glad to see your ugly damn face again!
La Hire, I'm warning you -- don't swear!
Jeanne, let me introduce the king's half brother, the dogged Lord Dunois.
Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this!
What happened? Who gave the order to attack?
God knows, but it was a bad idea!
I swear I'll never swear again in my life if you save her life! But I'm warning you, if you let her die, then you're the biggest...
Physicians are a waste of time. You'll have more luck with this charm of mine... it saved my life at Agincourt!
Prepare these as battering-rams!
What's the use? The drawbridge is up!
We... won?!
You call this... glory...? All this... this blood... this smell of...
... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm! I love it!
Take mine instead -- here -- smash mine first!
Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
Jeanne... the man hasn't been paid for six months -- that's his only reward. Let him take a few teeth...
Jeanne, if you don't mind... I'll stay standing... this armor... it's a nightmare to get back up...
You don't believe me anymore?
When you were taken prisoner at Compiegne, did you have a horse?
Yes... a half-steed... white.
Who gave you that horse?
My king.
How many did he give you?
Five steeds and a few hackneys...
As much as for a Lord? What an honor! Did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?
No.
What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?
Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...
Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?
Jeanne... what are you doing?
What have you done to me?
Who... who are you...?
Who are you to even think you can know the difference between good and evil? Are you God?
I don't know... I thought...
YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?
I... don't know... what do you want from me?
What are you doing out here?
I might ask you the same question.
I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...
And what exactly is it that you can't take anymore of?
Everything! Prison -- humiliation -- being abandoned and betrayed by everyone -- I can't stand it anymore -- I'd rather die!
You'll be dead soon enough anyway, so why be in such a hurry? Why not face up to your lies? It's your lies you can't stand anymore...
I... I never lied!
If you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm, you wouldn't need to run away from yourself like this...
I am true -- to my Lord, the King of Heaven. He knows how much I love him -- that's all that matters to me...
That's too easy. One minute you want to die, the next you want to live... Do you think that life is a toy that can be played with and then broken when you don't want it anymore?
Oh? And just because you realize now, everybody else should forgive you?!
I don't know -- I don't care anymore -- I just want to be at peace!
Oh, so you don't want war anymore? You want to be at peace? You want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it?
I don't understand. What do you want from me?
Why were you yelling like that?!
What are you doing here? Please... leave... you can't stay here...
Why? Are you waiting for someone else?
Yes!
My... visions...
They're going to come and visit you in here?
Yes... that's what I pray for...!
I want to see that. Do you mind if I stay... on the side? I won't bother you.
No, no -- you can't stay or they won't come!
Why not?
They won't come anyway.
What do you mean, they won't come?
Why would they?
Because! Because I've always been faithful to God, and I've followed everything he said... and I've done everything he asked me...
God asked you to do something?
Yes... lots of things!
You mean God said, "I need you, Jeanne?"
No, but... he sent me so many signs!
What signs?
Like... like the wind... and the clouds... and... the bells... and what about that sword lying in the field... that was a sign...!
No. That was a sword in a field.
But... it didn't just get there by itself.
I'm not lying, I... I can't remember... leave me alone!
No! I don't want to know anymore! Leave me alone! I didn't kill that man!
Stop, stop... I can't remember! The battles were all so confusing... there was so much smoke, dust, noise... I was being attacked on all sides, so... maybe... perhaps I fought back but it was only to defend myself...
So your memory's coming back?
Yes... yes! And now you tell me why God let all these battles happen in the first place... if he's so powerful... he said he's "the creator of heaven and earth, the source of all life..." he could have easily stopped all this blood and misery? Why didn't he?
Is he the one who spread all this blood and misery?
No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?
In His name??
Yes! We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
"Let all who love me follow me"... Where does God get mentioned? Come on Jeanne, be honest. You fought for yourself, in your name.
I... I was defending myself as best I could! Everyone has the right to defend themselves, don't they? Or should I have let myself be killed?
No, no, you did fine. I'd even say well done. Besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think?
No, I do not think so. I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.
I don't agree. Why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?
Why are you doing this to me?? Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
Ah, pleasure... that's a difficult word to define. When does the pain end and the pleasure begin...? When did your pleasure begin with that sword in your hand...?
I never took pleasure in hurting anyone?
I -- I cleaned up my room, look... and I said my prayers... all of them... and...
What are you doing on the wall?
I'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful...
What for?
Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.
Do you think this cross will protect you?
"Love your enemies"...
My voices... my voices... do you think they will ever come back?
I don't think so.
Are you going to leave me too?
Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
There's nothing for me to do here anymore... I don't belong here I want to be with Him now...
Yes I am.
Are you willing to follow all His commandments?
Yes...
You know what you just signed, Jeanne? You just signed away my existence... For you I'm a lie, an illusion. You see? In the end, you were the one who abandoned me...
You think you are ready now?
Yes, my lord.
You know I'm always happy to see you, Jeanne, but to keep coming here twice, three times a day...
I need to confess.
But you already confessed this morning...
I need to confess again.
I saw a poor monk without shoes so I gave him some.
There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.
They weren't my shoes. Mine were too small.
Whose were they?
My father's.
I'm sure he'll forgive you.
He already did, but I want God to forgive me too.
Jeanne -- if we were to ask forgiveness all the time, we'd spend our whole life in church.
Is that bad?
Well no, but... Jeanne, are you happy at home?
Oh yes... very.
And your mother -- everything's fine with her?
Good, good. And your sister... Catherine -- she's still your best friend?
And what about your other friends... you don't like playing with them?
So... everything sounds... wonderful?
Yes, it is.
Then... why are you here so often?
I feel safe here. And it's where I can talk to him.
Him?
Well, I try and talk to him, but mostly he's the one who does the talking.
Who is this "he"?
He never says his name.
Beautiful.
He says... he says I must be good... and help everyone... and take care of myself. Do you think he's coming from the sky?
I heard about your sister, and I... understand your pain...
Why did she have to die?
Only God knows the answer to that.
I know Jesus says to love our enemies but I can't -- I just want the English to burn in hell for ever and ever!
I realize your anger, Jeanne, but we must learn to forgive. It's hard, but revenge will never bring about peace.
Then what will? And what will bring her back? And why did she have to die in the first place instead of me? Why didn't he take my life instead of hers? It was my fault -- I was late -- she gave me her hiding place...!!
I don't want to wait for his call.
Jeanne, be patient.
I want to be with him always...
Soon you'll be able to take the Holy Mass, and as you eat of his flesh and drink of his blood, you will be at one with him.
I'm sorry, Mr Wladek, he wants you to stop.
Why are you here, Mr. Wladek?
Someone you know?
A beauty. Who is she?
A singer. Her husband's an actor. I knew them well. Good people. I'd like to talk to her.
This is my husband. Wladyslaw Szpilman. Marek Gebczynski sent him.
I'm going to get a doctor.
You can't, it's too dangerous.
I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.
Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's a pediatrician.
Hello.
I came specially to meet you today. I love your playing, but what a day to choose.
Who are you?
My name's Dorota, I'm Jurek's sister. oh! You're bleeding.
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks. And at last he gave in and said, 'All right, come with me tomorrow,' and so I came and they bombed the station.
You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.
Really?
I've always loved your playing, Mr. Szpilman.
Wladek, please.
Oh, Mr Szpilman, you're quite... quite wonderful.
Dorota!
I didn't want to come, I didn't want to see all this, but I couldn't stop myself.
How are you doing?
Fine, no, not really, they arrested my cousin, but Jurek says they'll let him out. This is disgraceful.
Don't worry, it won't last long.
That's what I said, it's so - it's too absurd!
Wladyslaw Szpilman.
Dorota.
Sit.
I'm sorry - I was given this address. I'm looking for a Mr-- -- a Mr Dzikiewicz.
I need help.
He'll be back before curfew.
I've been in hiding. I need somewhere to stay.
How long have you been married?
And how's Yurek?
When's your baby due?
What did I tell you?
Will I still be able to play?
Let me see this.
To tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse.
For what? For my tie?
It's not going to be very comfortable.
I'll be fine.
Must feel better this side of the wall.
Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.
Get your things together, you have to leave!
I'm on the run!
What's happened?
The Gestapo found our weapons. They've arrested Janina and Andrzej. They're bound to find out about this place, too - you must get away at once.
Where do you want me to go? Look at me. No, no, I'm not leaving. Can't I take my chances here?
Have you seen this?
What's happened?
Oh my God, it's terrible, you've got to do something, oh my God!
Calm down, what, what is it?
Halina?
What?
Funny time to say this.
What?
wish I knew you better.
Henryk's in there.
I haven't seen him.
Believe me, they've picked him up.
Tough luck.
Can you help?
Oh, you need me now, yes, now you need me!
Can you help us?
It costs.
I've no money.
Then there's nothing I can do. He should've joined us when I gave him the chance..
Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.
Who told you?
We're recruiting.
Who's recruiting?
Don't be clever with me, Henryk. I've come here as a friend. They're bringing Jews in from all over the country. Soon there'll be half a million people in the ghetto. We need more Jewish police...
Oh? More Jewish police? You mean you want me to wear a cap like yours, beat up Jews with my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see!
Someone's got to do it, Henryk.
But why me? I thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers. Look at my father, look at us, I mean...
Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
Yes, please.
And suppose they take the table away?
What d'you mean, take the table away?
The Germans go into Jewish homes and they just take what they want, furniture, valuables, anything.
What's this about?
And, please, tonight, for once, I don't want anything bad talked about. Let's enjoy our meal.
Henryk, I said nothing bad.
Boys, boys...
They bombed us, we're off the air.
Mama, that was a great dinner.
No, no. Listen, I've been thinking --
That makes a change.
You know what we do? We use psychology.
We use what?
We leave the money and the watch on the table. And we cover it like this. In full view. The Germans will search high and low, I promise you, they'll never notice it.
Of course they'll notice it. But look-- This is a good place for something.
A good place for what? He's insane!
But...they won't get all of us... we'll...it's too small...there's four hundred thousand of us in Warsaw!
You sell anything?
Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
That's better than yesterday.
Three lousy zlotys. And there are people here making millions.
I know.
It's not funny.
Well, you know what's funny? You're funny with that ridiculous tie.
You go to Heller, did I ask you to talk to him?
Did you beg, did you grovel to that piece of shit, that cockroach?
I didn't grovel, I asked him to help.
What did you pay him?
Pay him? With what? With what could I pay him? Every zloty I earn we spend on food!
I can look after myself!
They were taking you away.
It's nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people's business?
You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.
What's the matter? Are you sick?
What's that mean, no employment certificate?
You have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the German firms in the ghetto, otherwise...
Otherwise what?
What are you reading?
Very appropriate.
No one thought they'd hold out so long.
should never have come out. I should've stayed there, fought with them.
Wladek, stop that. It's over now. Just be proud it happened. My God, did they put up a fight.
Yes, so did the Germans.
They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?
Yes, but what good did it do?
Ah, here. Today's news from the other side.
You're amazing, Jehuda.
No, I'm a socialist. I have brothers everywhere. They bring me news and food. We care about our fellow human beings. Workers of the world unite.
So, what's the news?
The Germans are advancing on Kharkhov.
I don't know why I come here every evening, it's always such bad news.
Jehuda, give me something to do.
You're an artist, Wladek, you keep people's spirits up. You do enough.
But I want to help, I want to.
There are notices going up. The city's to be cleansed of undesirables.
Five hundred. You know how many people on average read one copy? Twenty. That makes ten thousand readers. These will start the uprising. Majorek hides them in his underpants. And leaves them in toilets.
I thought you'd be off on tour, playing London, Paris, New York?
I have to say you look terrible. What's the trouble?
You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?
Rumours, rumours, you take it all too much to heart, Wladek.
I've been trying to get a certificate of employment for my father. I've managed to get certificates for me and the rest of the family but I need one more for my father. I've been trying all the firms, the shops...
Why didn't you come to me?
I didn't know you were in the certificate business.
I'm not, but Majorek is.
Can you help? I've no money...
Jurek? Wladek Szpilman.
Wladek! How are you?
Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you?
Fine, we're fine in the circumstances. But I can guess what you've called about. There's nothing we can do; they won't reopen the station--
Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek...
...not even music, nothing, no radios for the Poles. But I'm sure you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist like you.
Puppydog, what d'you mean, you forgot?
What d'you think I mean, Kitten? I forgot, that's what I mean.
You know what? You treat me like dirt!
I treat you like dirt because you are dirt.
Pig!
Cow!
Pig!
Bitch!
Dirty pig!
You're a dirty pig!
If I play like an angel, why don't you listen?
I was listening, Kitten.
How long have you been here?
They're going to start the final resettlement now. We know what it means. We sent someone out. Zygmunt. A good man. His orders were to follow the trains out of Warsaw. He got to Sokolow. A local railwayman told him the tracks are divided, one branch leading to Treblinka. He said every day freight trains carrying people from Warsaw forked to Treblinka and returned
Have a favour to ask. I want to get out of here.
It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard.
I tried your friends. They're not at that address any more. But.
You made contact?
Thank God - Wladek! You're wounded.
It's a little cut, nothing.
Pack, darling, get your things, pack.
Where are we going?
Out of Warsaw.
And what do you think you'll do while you're setting up a new line of defence? Wander round lugging your suitcases?
Pack, Wladek, there's no time.
No, no, no, I'm staying put. If I'm going to die, I prefer to die at home.
I'm sorry, I did my best, I thought the certificates would save us all.
You don't remember me, Mr. Szpilman?
No, I don't think so?
Warsaw Radio. I was a technician. I saw you almost every day.
Sorry, I don't remember.
You don't want to worry about that. My grandfather was jilted by his girl friend when he got jaundice. In my opinion, jaundice is not very serious. Drink up.
What the hell are you doing?
I was... I was trying to open this tin.
What's your work?
I am... I was a pianist.
Where are you hiding?
In the attic.
What's all that gunfire?
What's happening?
Are the Russians here?
I don't know how to thank you.
What about you?
I've got another one. Warmer. What will you do when it's all over?
I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio.
Tell me your name. I'll listen out for you.
Szpilman.
Watch your feet!
Careful! Watch his hand.
Well you stopped combing your hair, which is a good thing, it was looking over done. You see these are the slits that the heads will go through, show him Nessie ... they'll be dead, the Reverend is going to use animal blood, no doubt it will be very dramatic. Tea!
I can't imagine a fate worse than being dumb. Turn around.
To be deaf?
Ohhh, it's so dark, it's like a dank cave.
Yes, like a cave.
We have just come from George Banes' and they have taken him over. It is no wonder he is leaving, he has got in too deep with the natives. They sit on his floor as proud as Kings, but without a shred of manners.
What would you think if someone played a kitchen table like it were a piano?
Like it were a piano?
I knew she was mute, but now I'm thinking it's more than that. I'm wondering if she's not brain affected.
No sound at all?
No, it was a table.
Oh, yes, yes of course, a concern.
There is something to be said for silence
And with time she will, I'm sure, become affectionate.
How are the lessons going? ADA nods enthusiastically. He's getting on all right? ADA nods again Good.
He is quite altered, as if they had been trying some native witchcraft on him. Well tomorrow or the day after he will be gone.
Baines is packing up?
My REAL father was a famous German composer
Ohh the tag is broken.
I thought she met your father in Luxemburg.
Well, yes, in Austria where be conducted the Royal Orchestra.
Which mountains are those dear?
The Alps.
Ohhh I've never been there.
One day when my mother and father were singing together in the forest, a great storm blew up out of nowhere. But so passionate was their singing that they did not notice, nor did they stop as the rain began to fall and when their voices rose for the final bars of the duet a great bolt of lightening came out of the sky
Well, that is a strong opinion.
I got the good wife for you Peini. She pray good. Clean. Read Bible. You sleep her Peini. She chief daughter.
Don't answer, he low born. Jun look at him, mongrel. Your wife where she?
She lives her own life in New Jersey, America.
Go Peini ... Haere atu e Peini.
I worry for you.
No, I love her, we will be a family. I have her piano. I will mend it, she will get better.
She looks tired.
What's he say?
Someone died here. It's tapu.
They want more money. They are trying to make two days out of it?
Those 80 acres, that cross the stream, what do you think of them?
On your property?
Good, flatish land with reliable water, why? I don't have money. What are you about?
I'd like to make a swap.
What for?
The piano.
You'd have to organise it up here.
Yes, I thought that.
Well Baines the music lover, I never would have known. Hidden talents George.
I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without them.
T-w~e-l-v~e.
Yes, why not.
I'll have to come and hear you play. what do you play.
I don't think you should have given up the piano. I will make sure you are properly taught, with music written on to sheets and...
I don't want to learn.
You don't want to learn.
No.
And what does this do to our bargain? I cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay.
No, no payment. I have given it back. I don't want it.
Well, I doubt I want it very much myself.
It was more to your wife that I gave it.
Has Ada ever spoken to you?
You mean in signs?
No, words. You have never heard words?
She has spoken to me. I heard her voice. There was no sound, but I beard it here . Her voice was there in my head. I watched her lips, they did not make the words, yet the harder I listened the clearer I heard her, as clear as I hear you, as dear as I hear my own voice.
Spoken words?
No, but her words are in my head. I know what you think, that it's a trick, that I'm making it up. No, the words I heard, were her words.
Please take us to the beach where we landed.
You have to wash them.
Wash them again.
She wants to see what you can do.
I'd rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.
Everyone has to practice.
He says you're not to see her or he'll chop her up!
Quiet down! Shhh! Where is she?
He chopped it off
What did she say?
She says, throw the piano overboard.
What?
She says, throw it overboard. She doesn't want it. She says it's spoiled
What's in here then, lead?
It's my mother's piano.
Oh no, it can't come now.
She wants it to come.
We can't leave the piano
Hello, then.
What on?
What does she say?
She says it's her piano, and she won't have him touch it. He's an oaf, he can't read, he's ignorant.
I know why Mr. Baines can't play the piano.
You've missed this bit.
And when is the next lesson?
He's given it to us.
Is it all right? Aren't you going to play something? ADA pulls up a chair and seats herself at the piano. She rubs her hands and places them lightly on the keys, she turns from habit over her left shoulder where STEWART waits crossed armed. Quickly she removes her hands, stands and gestures FLORA to play. FLORA proudly takes ~p the seat, she pulls
Play a gig.
Do I know any gigs?
Mama.
You the owner here?
That's right.
Lieutenant Snyder. Bunco.
Joliet badge, Snyder. Don't cut much up here.
I'm lookin' for a guy on the lam from a counterfeiting rap. Thought he mighta come in here.
Don't think so. I know everybody in the place and I always bounce the lamsters.
All right if I look around your lobby?
Which way are the rooms?
Who told ya this guy was in here?
Nobody. I just know what kinda women he likes. I'm gonna check all the joyhouses till I find him.
Maybe I could help ya if ya told me his name.
I think I'll keep that to myself. Which way are the rooms?
What are ya gonna do, call the cops?
Visitation is still up by two at the three-quarters. Single Action second, Fasanella third.
What's the line on Visitation?
7 to 2. That ain't bad.
Best we had was Cat's Eye in the second at Del Mar, and he was only 5-2. Not many longshots comin' in today.
Yeh, go ahead.
The wallet. You gotta go after him. He's got all the money.
Give it to me! Please. I gotta know it's all there!
You just sit tight, old man. We're gonna have to get you to a doctor. I'll call a cop.
You wanted by the law or somethin'?
Naw, it's okay.
You're crazy carryin' that kinda money in this neighborhood. No wonder you got hit.
Thanks. I'm obliged to ya, but I gotta get goin'.
You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.
I gotta! Look, I run some slots down in West Bend for a mob here. I got a little behind on my payoffs so they figure I been holdin' out on 'em. They gave me to 4:00 to come up with the cash. I don't get it there I'm dead.
It don't look good, gramps, it's ten of now.
I got a hundred bucks for you and your friend if you deliver the money for me.
I dunno. That little mug that got ya is mad enough at me already -- what if he's out there waitin' around a corner with some friends.
He won't know you're carryin' it. C'mon, you gotta help me out.
Sorry, pal. I'll fix you up, call you a doc, but I ain't gonna walk into a bunch of knives for ya.
How bout you? I'll give you the whole hundred!
If that punk and his pals decide to search ya, you'll never fool 'em carryin' it there.
What do we do?
You got a bag or somethin?
No.
How 'bout a handkerchief?
Jesus, what a bundle. Did you know he was that loaded?
Twist! When did you get back in town?
Listen Duke, we're setting up a wire store. I need a twenty man boost right away.
I got twenty or so in here tonight. Take your pick.
These guys have gotta be the quill, Duky. We can't afford to rank the joint.
Twist, you know this guy?
Paltrow, Sterling, Furey, and the Big Alabama are in from New Orleans. Fiskin and the Boone Kid from Denver, and Phillips, Barnett and Limehouse Chappie from New York. Those and the guys outside should give ya 30 or so to choose from.
Good, have 'em down at Stenner's old Pool Hall before 3:00. We're gonna run through the route tonight.
Okay, Twist, but you know if this blows up, I can't do ya no good downtown. Gondorff is Federal.
You're late. Where you been?
I had some appointments.
How much did ya lose?
All of it.
In one goddamn night? What are ya sprayin' money around like that for? You coulda been nailed.
I checked the place out. There weren't no dicks in there.
You're a con man, and you blew it like a pimp. I didn't teach ya to be no pimp.
What's eatin' you? I've blown money before.
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
You think my play is bad?
...It's the only reason I ain't quit before now.
What?
I'm gettin' too slow for this racket. I done the best I'm gonna do. You hang on too long, you start embarrassin' yourself.
What are you talkin' about? We just took off the biggest score we've ever had. We can do anything we want now.
It's nothin' compared to what you could be makin' on the Big Con. You're wastin' your time workin' street marks.
Hey look. You think I'm gonna run out on ya or somethin'? Just cause we hit it big. Luther, I owe you everything. If you hadn't taught me con, I wouldn't know nothin'.
Aw hell, you sound like some goddamn sucker. You know everything I know. You got nothin' more to learn from me.
But you played the Big Con. You said it was nothin'. A game for flakes and mama's boys.
What the hell you gonna do with yourself?
Straighten up, kid. I wouldn't turn ya out if ya weren't ready. I got a guy named Henry Gondorff I want you to look up. There ain't a better insideman alive. He'll teach ya everything ya gotta know.
You'll take a cut of what I make, won't ya?
I'm out, Johnny.
If that's the way you want it.
We'll put Salino on it. I need somebody careful.
Salino? Why waste our best people on a small-time job like this? It ain't no heavy gee we're after. The guy's a five and dime grifter.
Then why ain't he dead?
They didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all. They'll get him next time.
And tell Cole I wanta see him when he gets in.
He's not comin' in. Not to get bounced off a job anyway.
Granger, this is Combs. Why haven't we heard from ya? Everybody else is in.
We had a few problems with the Law this morning. The Mayor promised the Jaycees to get tough on the rackets again, so he shut everybody down for a couple hours to make it look good. Nothing serious, it just put us a little behind for the day.
You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?
Hell yes. He does this every year. There's nothing to worry about.
Okay, finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can. I don't wanta be here all night.
Believe me, the Man's gonna be real happy. Looks like we cleared over ten grand this week.
We cleared 22 here.
Well, hell, you got the whole Chicago south side. How do ya expect the eight lousy spots I've got to compete with that?
I just got the count. We'll put the take on the 4:15.
Buck Duff. I was in Maxwell's boost in Troy.
You the Duff that didn't come up with his end when Little Jeff was sent up?
Wasn't no problem a mine.
He was a con man, wasn't he?
He was a tear-off rat. He got what he deserved. No sense helpin' pay his bills.
Hey, Luther told me he was carrying a wad, but I didn't figure this much.
Which way did he do, Eirie?
Straight north. He was gonna take it all and run.
How do you like that Coleman, huh? After three years.
Aw come on, it was the only thing to do. He knew he was holdin' ya back.
We were partners. If it weren't for Luther I'd still be hustlin' pinball down at Gianelli's. I don't need anything more than I got.
You ain't gonna have nothin' if you don't lay off them games of chance. There's a depression on ya know.
There's always a depression on.
If you saved a little, you wouldn't have to grift so much.
I like griftin'.
You could buy yourself some things. Clothes, or a nice car...
I don't look any good in clothes and I don't know how to drive. What else ya got to sell, Eirie?
I thought you blew all your money.
What the hell you gonna do when Snyder rushes his finger right to Lonnegan? You're committin' suicide, kid.
Aw Christ, it doesn't make no difference now. If Snyder knows about it so does everybody else. He never gets anything first...Damn, there's no answer at Luther's.
Doyle, can I see you a minute?
I'm busy, Floyd.
It's important. We had a little trouble in Chicago today. One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.
Which one?
Mottola.
No, we checked his story with a tipster. He was cleaned by two grifters on 47th.
They workin' for anybody?
I don't know. Could be. We're runnin' that down now.
We got word from Chicago. They got one of the grifters last night. The nigger.
What about the other one?
They're still looking for him.
Who's got the contract?
Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.
Hackers.
Name's Danny McCoy. No Neck McCoy we called him. Runs a few protection rackets for Carnello while he's waiting for something bigger to come along. Me and Danny been friends since we were six. Take a good look at that face, Floyd, cause if he ever finds out we let one lousy grifter beat us, you'll have to kill him and every other hood
Yes sir.
I've had it with that bum, Floyd. Stack me a cooler.
You've only been playin three hours, Doyle.
I don't care. Load me a deck. Set it up for threes and nines. I'll cut it in on his deal.
What do ya want the others to get?
I know I give him four threes. We can't let him get away with that.
Looks all right. It's big enough and off the street.
I don't know. This is kinda short notice. I'm not sure we can get it all done by Saturday.
Been a while since I stocked a wire store. Not many mobs playing that anymore.
All we need is the bookie setup for now. We'll worry about the telegraph office later.
All right, I'll rent ya everything I got in the warehouse for two grand. That'll give ya phones, cages, blackboards and ticker gear. You supply the guys to move 'em. If you want a counter and bar, that's another grand. I don't know where the hell I'm gonna get 'em though.
C'mon, you can do better than that. We ain't no heel grifters.
You want the stuff tomorrow or don't ya? It's gonna take hours just to clean it up. Besides, Gondorff's still a hot item. Where am I gonna be if he gets hit?
We bought ya a tap into Moe Anenberg's wire. He's got eyes at every track in the country. You'll get race results, odds, scratches, pole positions, everything; and just as fast as Western Union gets 'em.
Does J.J. know how to use this thing?
Turn the goddamn thing off, will ya.
You sober?
Glad to meet ya, kid. You're a real horse's ass.
I'm sorry about Luther. He was the best street worker I ever saw.
He had you down as a big-timer. What happened?
Aw, I conned a Senator from Florida on a stocks deal. A real lop-ear. He thought he was gonna take over General Electric. Some Chantoozie woke him up, though, and he put the feds on me.
You mean you blew it.
Luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth.
He didn't tell me you was a fuck- up, either. You played the Big Con since then.
You gonna stay for breakfast, or do you already know how to eat?
I picked something up on the way.
Lonnegan after you, too?
I don't know. Haven't seen anybody.
Gondorff, you gonna teach me the Big Con or not?
You didn't act much like you wanted to learn it.
I wanna play for Lonnegan.
You know anything about him?
Aw right, he runs the numbers outta the south side.
And a packing company, a chain of Savings and Loans and half the politicians in Chicago and New York. There ain't a fix in the world gonna cool him out if he blows on ya.
I'll take him anyway.
Why?
You can't do it alone, ya know. It takes a mob of guys like you and enough money to make 'em look good.
We'll get by without 'em.
This isn't like playin' winos on the street. You gotta do more than outrun the guy.
I never played for winos.
You gotta keep Lonnegan's con, even after you spent his money. And no matter how much you take from his, he'll get more.
You're sacred of 'em, aren't ya?
Right down to my socks, turkey. If I'da been half as scared a that lop-ear, I wouldn't a fallen asleep on 'em. Lonnegan might kill me, but at least he won't bore me to death.
Then you'll do it?
He's not as tough as he'd like to think.
He's waitin' for you in the card room.
You just worry about your end, kid.
How'd ya do?
Everything go all right?
No signs of trouble?
What do ya mean?
You know, somebody tailin' ya. A torpedo or somethin'.
How 'bout Lonnegan?
I gave him the breakdown just like ya told me to.
And?
He threatened to kill me.
Then he drove me home. He tried to put himself away as legit, so I went right into the pitch.
You think he'll show?
Did he say he wouldn't?
No.
Why didn't you tell me about Snyder before?
Well you found him again and we're gonna have to do somethin' about it. What else haven't ya been tellin' me?
Nothin'. I told ya everything there is.
Then why'd ya move outa your room?
It was too noisy.
You know how easy it'd be for one of Lonnegan's guys to nail you?
All we need is a couple days, Henry. A couple days and we'll get Lonnegan down and stomp on 'em.
You just won't learn, will ya. Hell, you come in here, I teach you stuff maybe five guys in this world know, stuff most grifters couldn't do even if they knew it, and all you wanna do is run down a bullet. You're just like all them new jerks. Lotsa nerve and no brains. And ten years from now when me and the others
A couple days; that's all I'm askin'. I can stay clear that long.
What's the matter, kid? You're not sayin' much.
Just a little nervous, that's all.
Take it easy, you won't lose him now. We had him 10 years ago when he decided to be somebody. Believe me, I've seen enough to know.
How many guys you conned in your life, Henry?
I better do some packin'. I'm gonna be a hot number again after tomorrow.
Then why you doin' it?
Henry.
Yeh.
I appreciate your stickin' your neck out. I wouldn't have asked ya if it weren't for Luther.
You beat him, kid.
You were right, Henry. It's not enough... But it's close.
You wanta wait for your share?
He's been taking the 8:10 Century Limited outa New York on Friday and getting in here early Saturday morning. He usually stays a day to check on his policy operations, and then flies back.
Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways.
The porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars. $100 minimum, straight poker. Last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left New York.
We'll use the wire. Never known a gambler who wouldn't like to beat the ponies.
The wire is ten years outa date.
All you gotta do is show up with some money and look like a fool.
He's gonna hit ya with 20 grand, Eddie. How much cash we got?
Not enough to cover a bet that big.
Looks like he's sulking.
What's the problem?
Lonnegan's a fast egg, Henry. He's not gonna sit still for a standard play.
I'm not sure I know it.
You in?
Yeh, I think so. I gave the kay- ducer a C-note. You find out the deck?
He usually plays with a Royal or a Cadenza. I got you one of each. He likes to cold deck low, 8's or 9's.
Look at that. He's got four apes with him.
How ya doin'?
Yeh, that'd be real nice of ya, Mr. Lonneman.
Raise 500.
See ya and raise three.
See and raise five.
Raise 300.
Raise 1,000.
See and raise 1,000.
I guess I left it in my room.
Never get enough, huh pal? I'd think you'd get tired of losin', Honnigan.
The name is Lonnegan.
I can't lay that off in time. We lose a bet that big, it could break us.
If ya win it could make ya, too.
A half mill on an eight to one shot. You're dumber than I thought, Lonnegan.
She coulda killed me last night.
Too many people coulda seen ya go in her room. She was a professional. Used to work in the Dutch Schultz gang.
Who are you?
Gondorff asked me to look after ya.
How do I know you're tellin' the truth.
Hi there, Snyder. Things a little slow down at the Bunco Department tonight, eh? Somebody lose the dominoes?
You scored blood money today, Hooker. You need a friend.
I'll tell ya what you did, smart boy. You tied into a loaded mark on 47th across from Maxies. You and Coleman played the switch for him and blew him off to a cab on 49th. If he hadn't been a numbers runner for Doyle Lonnegan, it woulda been perfect.
You're crazy. I'm not stupid enough to play for rackets money.
Not intentionally maybe, but that don't make no difference to Lonnegan. He'll swat you like any fly.
I'll square it with the fixer.
My end was only one.
Excuse me, sir. Treasury Dept... I'd like to ask you a few questions.
What for? I haven't done anything.
We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station. Have you made any purchases here today?
Then I'm afraid we'll have to impound your money until we're sure that it's all good. Can I see your wallet and your ticket, please?
But I got a train to make.
It'll only take 20 minutes or so. You can pick it up at the window down the hall.
But what about all these other people?
I'm sorry, really I am, but my train leaves in ten minutes.
All right, I'll give ya a break. Down that hall there, there's an unmarked door on the left. Go on in there and wait at the window. I'll take this... ...in the back and run it through right away. We'll have you outta there in a couple minutes.
Thank you. You don't know how much I appreciate this.
You done?
Yeh, I guess I shoulda had the meat loaf.
It isn't any better.
Where's June today?
She don't work here no more. I'm fillin' in for a couple days... till I can get a train outa here.
Where you goin'?
Meat loaf, apple pie and a cup of coffee.
What time you get off work here?
2:00 A.M.
You doin' anything tonight?
You got a back door to this place?
No. What's wrong with the front?
Look, I don't have time to fuck around. There's somebody out there I don't need to see. You got a fire escape or anything?
No.
All right, do me a favor. Go into the bathroom, open the window and wait for me there.
What the hell for?
What does this guy want?
Looks like he missed ya.
I, ah...thought you might wanna come out for a while. Maybe have a drink or somethin'.
You move right along, don't ya.
I don't mean nothin' by it. I just don't know many regular girls, that's all.
And you expect me to come over, just like that.
I don't even know you.
You sure it'll be one of these two?
Twist? I told him the tale. He wants to see ya.
All right, when?
Tomorrow, after 4:00. Stay inside, I'll come in and get ya. And be hard on him for a while; he's talking money.
Les, I got Mr. Lonnegan with me. He wants to see you a second.
What the hell's the matter with you. We coulda met at a club or somethin'.
I thought it might be good for him to see the setup.
Hooker!
Ain't seen you in months, boy. Thought maybe you took a fall.
Naw, just a little hard times, that's all. It's all over now.
You sure you wanna start off that big? Bet like that could put a real dent in us.
I feel lucky tonight.
Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you just...
Your boss is quite a card player, Carver. How does he do it?
He'll have to take a check. I couldn't find my wallet.
Yeh, he knows that.
What do you mean?
You were set up, Lonnegan. Shaw's been planning to beat your game for months. He was just waiting for you to cheat him so he could clip ya.
I could have you put under this train for this, errand boy.
So could Shaw.
Then why the rat?
What's the matter? You gotta get back to Shaw?
Naw, he picked up some jane in the bar. Can't see him till morning anyway.
Why me? Shaw probably has lotsa enemies to choose from.
I need somebody respectable...but not completely legit. What I'm gonna do isn't very legal.
I'm a banker, friend. That's legit in this state.
If you help me out, I'll pay ya back the money you owe Shaw, myself.
That's worth fifteen grand to ya?
You're dreamin', kid.
660 Marshall Street. Tomorrow at 12:30, if you're interested.
You should always look to the back too, kid.
I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
Get on with it then.
Sometime after 1:00 a guy's gonna call here and give you the name of a horse. All you do is take this two grand across the street to Shaw's place and bet it on that pony. There's nothin' to it, but don't take too much time. We only have 3 or 4 minutes after you get the call.
You're not gonna break him with a $2,000 bet.
This is just a test. The big one comes later. Be careful with that though, it's all I got.
And you were gonna pay me back?
You really picked a winner, kid.
Well, what did I tell ya?
You're a lucky man, all right.
Lucky, hell. I could do it every day.
Why don't ya then.
'Cause it's better to do it all at once. We're puttin' down 400 grand next week. At 5-1 we make 2 million. Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.
You stayin' in or not?
I'm in.
You got the 400 grand yet?
Not yet, but... Hey, there's only a grand here.
I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.
What is this? That's my money. You tryin' to muscle me?
I gotta talk to me partner first. We can't afford to expose our game too much.
Let me talk to him.
No.
What happened to your face?
A week's a long time, friend. Anything can happen. All of it bad.
What happened?
I didn't get the bet down in time.
Tell your friend I'll have the money here by post-time tomorrow. We'll take the first race where the odds are 4-1 or better. And make sure I can get to that window this time.
How am I gonna do that?
You want a drink or something?
No.
We want to talk to ya about Henry Gondorff.
Don't think I know him.
Well give yourself a couple seconds, crumb. You wouldn't wanna lie to me. Lt. Snyder here says you done a lotta griftin' in this town.
You got nothin' on me.
Look, I got nothin' against you, but you're in trouble here. All you gotta do is tell us when Gondorff's gonna play his chump. We come in at the sting, make the pinch, and you walk out free as a bird. No questions, no court appearance, nothing.
You've already done time twice, and judges don't like three time losers. You wanna sit in the can for forty years, startin' tonight?
I'll make parole.
Will you wait until the chump is played?
Hell yes. We don't care about the mark. He deserves what he gets.
I mean completely played. Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him. You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.
All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight.
Can't do it. There're telegraph inspectors all over the place. I got 750 grand coming in from the coast, and I'm not gonna blow it for a lousy 14 gees. We'll get somebody else to do our betting.
I could come up with 750 grand in a day if I had a reason to.
But who says you will. I got a guy I can depend on. He's liquidating everything he has for this. You wouldn't even give Carver his money back.
I need more proof, that's all. Anybody can get lucky once.
On a 6-1 shot? The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day. We split 60-40.
We were getting 50 from our guy.
Yeh, and what if we play tomorrow and he doesn't come up with the money. We risk our whole operation for nothing. I'll say when we make our bets.
Take it easy. Everything's all right. I put it on Syphon, on the nose.
All right, Riley. What the hell happened?
We missed him.
You weren't hired to miss him.
There wasn't any way he coulda known we was in there. We made a clean pick on the lock and didn't leave no footprints in the hall. Somebody musta wised him up.
Yeh, and what does Cole say about that?
I don't know. He took it hard.
We'll take it. You manage the building at the end of the alley?
For fifteen years.
I'll need a room over there that faces this way. How much a week?
Only rents by the month. Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.
This is the last time I expect to see you down here.
What is this? I got work to do.
Do ya know him or don't ya?
Yeh, but I don't know where he is.
Well we do. He's chummin' around with a Big C named Henry Gondorff. Ring any bells?
Sure. Every bunco man in the country knows Gondorff.
There's word he's gonna run a con on the North Side here. We got a year-old Florida warrant on him, but it's a thin beef, and he can beat it in court unless we catch him cold. All we want you to do is pick up Hooker for us.
Why don't you pick him up yourself?
Cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin' him. If word gets around that Feds are in on it too, Gondorff'll fold up the whole thing.
Wouldn't that be too bad. You'd hafta move outa this nice office ya got.
Don't crack wise to me, flatfoot. I spent a lotta time in dumps like this, eatin' Gondorff's dust while the bunco squad gets rich tippin' him off. But it's not gonna happen this time. We're not even gonna let the police know we're here. If you keep your mouth shut and do a job, there'll be a promotion in it for ya. And you
What the hell good is Hooker to ya?
He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.
He'll never do it.
Sorry. I don't know anything about it.
Come on, gimme a break.
Have the police got any idea where Wynant is?
What about this Rosebreen?
What's your next step, Nick?
Right back to California. We've got to go home and rest up from our vacation.
There's a physiological as well as a psychological angle in my father's relationship with Julia Wolf that the police have overlooked. And I think it explains everything. You see, my father was a sexogenarian.
He was?
Yes. He admitted it.
Sexogerarian, eh? Yes. Yes. But I can't put that in the paper.
Why not?
You know how they are... sex...
Then just say he was sixty years old.
Is that what it means?
I didn't know you invented that Smelting Process.
All settled? Grand! Why did your mother ever divorce him? He's swell.
Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
Cheer up, darling.
What's the matter, darling ... not sweet enough?
Darling, your father's all right. He'll turn up in time.
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
He's just forgotten. You know he forgets everything.
What could happen to him, darling? You mustn't worry.... What is it?
Now don't say that -- he's just off somewhere working.
Any luck?
She's got me worrying, too.
Don't start worrying about him. He's a good guy, but screwy.
Why did that man want to kill him?
Said he stole his invention.
What?
Nothing.
How are you?
Another young man.
Well!
That is, if it's all right with you.
Mind if I look around?
Oh, Andy.
Don't cry.
I can't help it. You don't know.....
Darling, you can't go through any more of this. Now you get together your clothes and your skates and we'll go out to my family's in the country.
I can't.
You've got to get your mind off this.
You're sweet, but the only thing that you can do for me is to go.
Go!
And don't ever try to see me again.
What are you talking about?
Please! You can't get mixed up in this.
Do you think I care
You don't understand. You don't know what's going to happen.
I only know I want to marry you... right now, and --
I can't marry you! I can't ever marry you!
Dorothy!
How would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children? It'd be fun, wouldn't it? Maybe they'd murder each other... keep it all in the family. That's what Father should have done. He should have killed me and Gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.
You're talking like a crazy person,
Why not? I am crazy....the whole family's crazy.
Dorothy.... listen to me. I love you. Don't you understand that? I love you.
This is a pretty dead bunch, isn't it?
You're high enough.
Darling, don't cry. Please. I know it's terrible. But isn't it really better this way?
How are you?.... Oh, I'm Mrs. Jorgensen now.... No, she isn't here. Is it about her father? Well, can I take the message?
Give it to me.
What is it? Has he found him?
What is it?
That isn't true. It was about your father. Where is he?
He's all right. Isn't that enough?
No.
You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more. He made a big settlement on you.
That's gone long ago. I've got to see him. Where is he?
Mother .... you couldn't do that. You couldn't go to her.
I didn't say I would. But we've got to have money.
Did it ever occur to you that Chris might work?
Don't. It's horrible.
You took that money from Julia's hand.
I didn't.
Then what are you hiding?
It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
You hand that over to the police.
I'll do nothing of the sort.
All right, then. I'll tell them.
I don't think you will. It's your father's.
I don't believe it! You're lying!
Oh!
Mother!
How are you? Here. Get under this.
Is your father still in there?
He's waiting for you.
Did he tell you where he was going?
He wouldn't say.
He didn't do it -- Nick!
Another Martini --
You know, we know each other.
Of course we do! We've been friends for years.
Aren't you Nick Charles?
Yes.
Not that scrawny little....?
Yes.
How did you ever remember me?
was fascinated with you.... a real live detective.... You used to tell me the most wonderful stories. Were they true?
Andy... this is Nick Charles. He worked on a case for father.
Yes. Some nut who wanted to kill him. How is your father?
That's what I was going to ask you. he's disappeared!
I don't know anything -- I've been in California for four years. What about his lawyer? Used to be a guy named Mac-- something.
Macaulay.
That's it... Herbert Macaulay.
tried him once -
Your father?
How do you do? I'm sorry we have to rush.
We're at the Normandie for a couple of weeks. Why don't you drop around?
I just wanted to relieve your mind. Your father's alive and all right.
Come on in.
You heard about Julia Wolf?
Yes.
There.
What are you trying to tell me? That you did it?
Yes. I hated her for coming between my mother and father. She kept me from seeing my father. I went down there to ask her where he was. She wouldn't tell me, and I shot her.
Where did you hit her?
Why... in the heart.
Pretty good shot you are. What did she do?
She fell down.
Did she make any sound? Didn't scream?
I don't know.
Which way did she fall?
She... she fell over backwards.
Where did you get this gun?
I bought it in a pawn shop.
Don't lie to me.
Hello, Dorothy.
Dead?
It's been the same one for three months.
Forgive me. How are you?
He'll still be your son-in-law!
You see how much we have to say.
Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.
Yes, she would.
I hate all that fuss. But I'll do it on one condition -- that you're there to give me away.
What would your mother say to that?
This is my wedding.
Wouldn't it be a little embarrassing ... all of us there ... your other and me and your stepfather?
He can stay home. Please, Dad, won't you?
Wait a minute. When is it going to be? I'm leaving town tonight.
Where are you going?
It's a secret. I can't even tell you, my dear. I've got an important idea to work on.
A new invention?
Yes. And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.
We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
Oh, I'll be back before Christmas.
It's a promise?
How's your brother?
I'd like to see him. Why don't you bring him down?
You know how it is, Dad. He's sort of under Mother's thumb.
I know -- I know --
Like all the rest of us. Has this fellow... ...has he seen the whole family?
And he still wants to marry me!
Poor Dad, does that still bother you?
Only in bad weather.
But it isn't bad weather now.
Better get home before it is.
Goodbye, darling. Don't you dare forget... December 30th.
You can take that out to the car.
Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
Yes.
Do you mind if I come down and see it?
Not at all.
Shrapnel!
Must have been in the war. That might account for the cane and his limp.
What is it, Gilbert? Tell mother! What did he say?
He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.
That woman!
Did they find any clues... a gun or fingerprints or anything?
Not a thing.
Did you kill her?
Gilbert!
Why not? You had a perfectly good motive.
Well, I've got my alibi. I was at the Public Library. Where were you?
I saw him too... he was wearing a green suit with a white tie...
What are you talking about, Gilbert? You weren't there!
How'd you people happen to pop in?
We hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the Wynant family, so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up. Then we seen him... ...sneak in and we decide to come up. And pretty lucky for you.
Yes. I might not have been shot.
I never saw him before.
What's he want of you?
Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.
What's that to you?
Nothing.
What'd he think it was to you?
Ask him. I don't know.
I'm asking you.
Not without a warrant.
Have you got a pistol permit?
No.
This gun yours?
No.
Who's is it?
I'll have to try to remember.
You oughtn't to play this trick on me. Running out when I was giving you time to rest up before I asked you those questions.
You mean about that gun?
Man to man, Mr. Charles, are you working on this case?
So would I.
What about the suicide?
Oh, that's a phoney. The men didn't even have to go down.
You've been there?
No proof?
Nothing yet to cinch it.
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
What do you mean?
For one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.
Who's your candidate?
I haven't got that far yet. But I don't think that everything points to Wynant. What about the alibis?
They're all O.K. Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.
What about Jorgensen?
What about this Nunheim?
Oh, he's all right. We know all about him. He does a little stooling for us every once in a while.
Did you know he was hanging around Julia?
No.
He's holding out on you.
Well, what'd you think?
I think we're on the right track.
Who're you calling?
I'm calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him. I want to see where he goes.
Trail him! Trail who?
Get anything?
I guess that cinches it, eh, Mr. Charles? He killed them both - Julia Wolf and Nunheim.
Fifty will still get you a hundred.
Just rolled them up and threw them in.
Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
"D.W.R." That case you worked on... the guy who threatened to kill Wynant... what what was his name?
Rosebreen.
Could this be him?
I never saw him. I don't think anyone saw him.
He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.
Yes. But we figured it was just blackmail...
What're you doing here?
Are you kidding?
No.
Why didn't you tell me? .... Why didn't you hold him?
You mean that body-----?
Shut up.
When was the last time you gave her money for Wynant?
Yesterday. I gave her a thousand dollars.
I said he hadn't written me.
Oh, then you did hear from him?
Well....
Well, what?
He telephoned me today.
He did!
I wasn't in. My secretary took the message. He left word for me to meet him at the Plaza.
When was that?
About three.
Did you go?
I know he'll turn up as soon as he sees this in the papers. You can't think he had anything to do with it, Mr. Guild. He wasn't the kind of man that....
Do you know what they fought about that night he went away?
I didn't know they had a fight.
There are a few things we want to check up on.
I see.
You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?
Why yes.
Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe's hand?
No.
Are you sure you didn't leave the room... that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
I don't think so. Of course I was terribly upset... I hardly knew what I was doing.
That's all right. Well, we'll be going.
Goodbye.
You did!
What kind of clothes was he wearing?
A brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it.
That's ridiculous.
Good morning --
But he's interested!
Do you think that Wynant did it?
I think we may as well sit down.
Mr. Guild means guests! Oh, there are two more to come.
They'll be here. Don't worry. My men are picking them up.
Have a shot?
What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
She drives me nuts. She's been ragging me all day.
Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.
That's a lie, Lieutenant... Anybody that says that is a liar.
Want to take a poke at him?
You'd done better to have told me that in the beginning. Where were you the afternoon she was knocked off?
You don't think I had anything to do with it?
Where were you?
Let me go! Let me bring her back. I can't get along without her. I'll bring her right back and I'll tell you anything you want to know. Let me go!
I can't remember offhand, Lieutenant. Maybe I was over at Charlie's shooting pool. Maybe I was here. She'd remember.
How'd you like to be thrown in the can on account of not remembering?
Don't mind what she says, Chris.
How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated... just because I haven't money.
I'll get some.
You've said that for weeks.
I know.
Why don't you go to see Julia? She handles his money.
Chris!
All right. All right.
I couldn't go near that woman.
What are you going to do?
Just what I said I'd do.
You wouldn't do that... you wouldn't!
Wouldn't I. Just watch me.
and there she was lying dead. The police said she'd probably been killed about ten minutes before I got there.
I thought you said you weren't going there.
Why, you said...
We're just having a little drink.
Who's that man?
He's not anybody. Just a fellow I used to know.
I thought you'd given up that sort of friend.
This is the first time I've seen him in years. I didn't want him to think I was high-hatting him.
I don't like him.
Don't worry. You won't see him again. What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
No. I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.
What bonds?
The government bonds. The ones you took from the office safe.
Oh yes. Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.
Don't you remember....
Now see here, Julia. You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded. You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it. But this is fifty thousand dollars!
Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....
No one else had the combination of that safe. You took them. What did you do with them?
What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
That's my business.
I want that money right now, or I'll hand you over to the police.
Go ahead!
That's a fine thing to throw up to me after all I've been to you....
Hello .... give me .... Well .... ?
I'll give it back to you .... all I've got ....twenty-five thousand...
You're going to return every cent of it!
I can't! I haven't got it!
What did you do with the rest?
I never had it.
Is there a Mr. Macaulay in the house? Oh, it's you.
Oh, hello. Come on in.
Good morning. I'm afraid this isn't a very "Merry Christmas" for you.
Oh, he's sitting up.
Asta - don't bother Mr. Macaulay.
I got word from Wynant this morning...
Oh, please, Nick.
Did you get my money?
I do wish you'd tell me where you're going.
I'm not telling anyone.
But suppose some business comes up...
One hundred... two hundred... three...
Never mind.
I wish you'd count them. There's a thousand dollars there.
I trust you.
Isn't there anything else I can do for you? Have you bought your ticket?
No.
Well, let me do that for you.
Thanks, and goodbye.
What'll I do if something comes up?
Settle it yourself. What have I got a lawyer for?
Is Julia going with you?
But what if you need more money?
How are you?
Hello, Macaulay. Come in.
Dorothy told me you were here. I was going to telephone but....
Nothing, thank you. Nothing. I wanted to see you... What's Mimi up to, Charles?
Mimi? ... Oh, Dorothy's mother. Does she have to be up to something?
She usually is. Trying one way or another to get money out of Wynant. I wanted to find out if you were er - er - --sleuthing for her.
I haven't been a detective for four years.
You don't say --
My wife's father died and left her a lumber mill and a narrow guage railroad and a couple of other things. And I'm looking after them.
I see. I see.
What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
You know as much about it as I do. I haven't seen him in three months.
No word at all?
My wife.
How do you do? What did you say?.... He is?.... Where is he? Very well. He's back in town.... Wynant. Thank heaven. He's waiting for me now. Forgive me, Mrs. Charles... but I've been so upset. It's no joke working for a man like that. I must be off. Goodbye.... Goodbye,
How are you?
I hate to bother you when you're laid up.
What are the chances of getting you to do what he wants?
It might.
He gave me a code message to insert in the Times, in case I wanted to get in touch with him.
I've done that already. He should appear, you know. It doesn't look well... his staying away at a time like this.
Hello.... oh, just a minute. Police department?
But it must have been Wynant. I should have known if it weren't his voice.
I have no right to answer that.
Oh, Nick... Nick!
Hello, Mimi.
Clyde Wynant's crazy... absolutely crazy to stay away at a time like this. No wonder the police think he has something to do with it.
What do you think?
Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I could find him... I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won't help at all. He thinks I just want money.
Well, don't you?
Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?
Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York. Hire one of them.
But he knows you. All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
I tell you again, I don't want any part of it. Now you take Dorothy home and...
Dorothy! Is she here?
Where's Gilbert?
Chris may be at the club -- or somewhere -- I don't see that it's important --
But he has nothing to do with it!
I tell you -- he didn't do it.
They'll want more than your word for that.
This is all very pleasant but why are here?
You did... where?
Last night. He came to see me at my apartment.
Oh, did he? What did he say?
Because I don't believe that Clyde's dead! Why, you said yourself you saw him last night.
Perfectly absurd.
Nobody told me. I did see him!
What did he pay you, Mimi, to stick to that story?
It isn't a story - it's true. I did see Wynant. He's not dead.
You're lying, Mimi. But then, you'd do anything for money. You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted -
I gotta talk to you. I want you to tell me something and I want you to give it to me straight. Get me?
I've never heard about you.
I didn't knock Julia off.
All right - you didn't.
I haven't seen her in three months. We were all washed up.
Why tell me?
I wouldn't have any reason to hurt her. She was always on the up and up with me. But that dirty little Nunheim -- he got sore cause I clicked with her and he didn't, so he put the finger on me.
That's all swell. Only you're peddling your fish in the wrong market. I've got nothing to do with it.
Listen. "Studsy" Burke told me you used to be O.K. That's why I'm here. Do they....
How is Studsy? I didn't know he was out of stir.
He's all right. He'd like to see you. But listen... What's the law doing to me? Do they think I did it, or is it just something else to pin on me?
I'd tell you if I knew. But I'm not in this. Ask the police.
That'd be very smart. That'd be the smartest thing I ever did. Me that a police captain's been in a hospital three weeks on account we had an argument. The boys would like to have me come in and ask questions. They'd like it right down to the end of their blackjacks. Now I come to you on the level. Studsy says you're on
What's that?
Morelli - You knew Julia. Was she gypping Wynant?
She don't say she is, but I figure she is -
Why do you say that?
Once I wanted five grand -- Cash -
What am I? The fall guy?
So it's you he was after!
Hello, baby.
He's dragged me into every gin mill on the block.
I had him out this morning.
I thought so. He even tried to drag me into the gentlemen's --
You might have mentioned me first.
He's well-trained. He'll behave himself.
Pretty girl.
If you like 'em like that.
You got types?
Only you, darling... lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
Who is she?
I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you. Dorothy is really my daughter. You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I was so young. I didn't know what I was doing. We were all like that on my father's side.
By the way, how is your father's side?
Much better, thanks.
How many drinks have you had?
Six Martinis.
What hit me?
I can't lie here. I've got to get up and trim that darned Christmas tree.
Who's that?
Come on -- relax -- Give them a drink.
I'd better order some food. That sounds like an interesting case. Wouldn't you like to take it?
I haven't the time. I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.
Sounds like a good case. Girl mysteriously murdered. No one knows who did it. They haven't found any clues yet -- no gun -- no fingerprints --
Isn't that my drink?
What are you drinking?
Where did you get that?
She brought it in. Trying to make me believe she did it.
What are you going to do with it?
She didn't tell me a thing.
Nick! Nick! Are you asleep?
Yes.
Good. I want to talk to you.
That's jolly.
Don't you think you'd like to go back to detecting once in a while, just for the fun of it?
Can't you get to sleep?
No.
Maybe a drink would help you.
No thanks.
Everybody says you were a grand detective.
They were kidding you.
I'd like to see you work.
That poor girl is in a tough spot.
She thinks you can. It wouldn't hurt you to find out if you could, would it?
Darling, my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows it. And the police'll catch him without my help.
I think I would like that drink. I'll give you your Christmas present now if you'll give me mine.
But it's Christmas now.
Breakfast.
What are you going to give me? I hope I don't like it.
Nick! Nick! There's someone to she you,
You idiot! Asta! Stop that! Get down! Now, stay there.
It's all right. It just grazed me.
Someone get a doctor.
There's one coming.
Well, quick -- get into bed. Are you all right?
Sure -- I don't even feel it.
I'll be all right. Don't let's fuss till the doctor comes.
Want a drink?
I wish that doctor'd come. How do you feel?
You're a fine watch dog.
He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
On it! I'm in it ... They think I did it!
I never saw that before.
No. It's a Christmas present.
Who gave it to you?
You did.
Finished with these?
I read you were shot five times in the tabloids.
Hello... send him up.
Who's that?
Aren't you hot in that?
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty. The Kirbys.
Is that another Christmas present?
Yes.
Did I give it to you?
Nick, listen. From Clyde Wynant! "Will you take charge of investigation on Julia Wolf murder. Communicate with Herbert Macaulay".
Let's see. Where's it from?
Philadelphia. Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?
I don't know.
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
Your guess is as good as mine.
Oh, it's a fire hydrant.
Well, that's that. Stay there, Nick!
It's not going to hurt me to get up.
Sit down!
You talk as if I were Asta.
What's the trouble, Asta? Your balloon busted? So's mine.
What's the matter with you?
The mystery's all gone. And I wanted you to find out who did it.
Maybe I will.
But Wynant --- ?
I don't believe he did it.
Why don't you?
No reason. Just a hunch. But I'm going to find out. I'm tired of being pushed around.
So am I.
This may be a little rough - you'd better let us go alone.
I wish they'd stop that. It makes me fidgety. Do you think they'll find him, Nick? He must be in New York.... Where do you think you're going?
I'm going to take Asta for a walk.
He's just been for a walk.
What's that? What are you up to? Nickie - what is this?
Looks like a hold-up!
What are you going to do?
I've got hunch. I'm going down to look at Wynant's shop, I want to find out why it's closed.
Why shouldn't be close it? He went away.
He went away lots of times when I knew him - but he never closed his shop. I've got a hunch something is up.
You mean, he might be hiding there?
I don't know... This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out.
Nick - I won't have you going down there.
Say you're the one who got me in this!
I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.
I'll be all right. I've got Asta to protect me.
Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.
You wouldn't be a widow long.
You bet I wouldn't.
Not with all your money!
You dog!
Goodbye, darling.
Nickie, take care of yourself won't you?
Sure I will.
Don't say it that way. Say it as if you meant it.
Why, I believe the little woman cares.
Back to California
My soul, woman. I give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
I did find him!
What do you mean?
He was down in the shop.
Nick!
It was his body that was buried there.
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
That's a fact.
Wynant's body?
Yup. Don't you want something to eat?
But they all said it was Rosebreen's.
That's what they think... Guild and all of them. They take it for granted that it's just another of Wynant's victims. Guild's hot-footing it around now, looking for Wynant. That's all that troubles him.
What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?
Several things. Hello, Fred. We're hungry again. Yeah, and lots of onions. Oh, and coffee.
Nick, you'll drive me crazy. What things?
Huh?
What things made you so sure?
Oh. Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed. The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.
Well, don't they?
You don't get another swallow 'til you really open up.
How long has he been dead?
Couple of months anyway.
Then he couldn't have committed those other murders.
Smart gal.
Wynant dead? Does Dorothy know?
I'm going to tell her.
Hey... hey. Don't do that.
But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...
I can't help it. I can't tell a soul. I didn't even tell Guild.
Why not?
I want to lie low till I get the whole dope. I don't want to go off half-cocked.
What are you going to do?
I'm going to get the real murderer. I've got an idea. Want to see me take him?
Yes!
Got a nice evening dress?
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
Got a nice evening dress?
I've got a lulu -- why?
I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.
The suspects! They won't come.
Oh, they'll come. I'll have Guild issue the invitations.
Who do you think did it?
Mimi...
Mimi!
You give such charming parties, Mr. Charles.
I can't wait any longer. Tell me, do you think one of them did it?
Yes.
I wish you'd tell me who.
Serve the nuts - I mean, serve the guests the nuts.
You're going to drive me crazy!
If that knife is missing, I'll look for it in your back.
Is that true?
I don't know.
Why are you saying it?
It's the only way it makes sense.
I hope you're well.
Come on out, now. He won't hurt you. Back to your old tricks, eh, Tanner?
No, Mr. Charles.
How did you get in here?
I had a key. I worked here... till they closed the shop.
You worked here?
Yes, sir. Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.
Well, that's a hot one. You a bookkeeper! When were you ever a bookkeeper?
That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing. I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.
Somewhere's where they might go out and leave the safe open?
Honest, Mr, Charles. I never touched that safe. Them bonds that were missing... Julia took them.
Trying to put it off on her?
Mr. Charles - she did - that's why he got sore at her and killed her. Listen, Mr. Charles -- I did do a little chiseling. I come to bring it back and fix up the books. I didn't want him to find out and come after me -
You can save that and tell it to the police. They'll be here in a minute.
I'm sorry. Tanner, don't you want some wine?
That's what Mr. Wynant said to me. If she re-married, all the money was to go to the children.
Nick Charles here?
Yes. Nick!
You his wife?
Yes.
Was he a good detective?
Well, congratulations.
I'm going to give her a wedding present. Thought I'd better do it now, before I forget it. I can drop them on my way to... That's funny.... Where are those bonds?
Bonds, sir?
I know I left them there.
Maybe Miss Wolf has them.
Maybe she has.
You're forgetting the check for your suitcase. It's at the Grand Central.
I'm sorry... but...
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
I just wanted to tell you...
Where are you going?
Home!
Home?
I'm fired.
Who fired you?
You speak English? DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH!?
Where were you going?
Baghdad.
What's in the other direction?
This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.
Turn the car around.
Please, I beg of you. The American army is there. I am Iraqi. They will kill me.
Think we're going to do it? Think we're going to war?
...And it's very important when you sit down never to point the soles of your shoes at anyone. It's considered offensive.
Like learning Arabic? You're gonna learn Arabic you might as well learn were we can get something to eat around here.
Well, based on my knowledge of the region, its culture and her people I would have to say it's a box.
Paper.
What's it say?
It's a map, I think that's what it is.
A casual one.
Damn, this is sweet. We are going to be home in no time.
You're out of your minds, you know that? Both of you. You don't even know if there's anything out there. What the hell are you thinking?
Yeah! Welcome to beautiful Iraq. Land of enchantment and riches.
What?
I know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.
Why, yes, Jaeger. I believe it is.
What are we going to do!?
They stopped.
Wha...
They shouldn't have been here.
We shouldn't have been here, Epps. There is a war going on!
This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters.
Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.
What are you doing.
You two fighting's not going to get us anything.
Maybe we are crazy for doing this. But if we do it, we do it right. I just needed to explain that in a way I wouldn't have to do it again.
Not much chance of that. Jaeger's an idiot.
He's not so--
He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.
What kind of mine?
I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.
Should have blown already. Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
We've got rope?
For climbing.
What if it's a Valloro 69? Just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us.
You just go when I say go.
Ready?
All right. Let's get out of here.
There's nothing we can do.
I don't want to see people killed any more than you. But we try to help out we die, and all we do is die.
We can't just go off and--
All we've got to do is make it to the top.
And find the treasure, and get it, and get back to the Humvee, and get the hell out of Iraqi without getting our heads blown off, but that's about it.
Not much of a pass.
Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here. Worn down to nothing now.
The US Army: Always an adventure.
Should be easy going from here. Stay on the pass straight to the dot.
What do you figure it to be?
Otherwise whatever we're looking for could be anywhere.
Where'd they go?
I don't know. There's a lot of space up here. They could be just about--
And they can't fly around out there forever.
Missile!
All right. Let's break out some utility shovels, lanterns, and a claymore in case we have to do any blasting. Me and Jaeger'll climb down, and see what we can see.
What am I supposed to do?
Epps!
I don't think the line will take the weight of a man and the coins. Wes!? We'll send the gold up, then me and Jaeger'll climb back.
You ready?
It'll be too dark to make our way back now. Let's bed down for the night and head out at first light.
What about the gold?
What about it?
Maybe we should split it up now.
We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.
You're the one with all the ideas.
You've had your say, Wes. Now leave it.
Maybe you've got ideas of your own for the gold. Maybe you've already got things worked out.
Maybe I do.
You got no reason to do that!
You got no reason to hit me. I'm getting tired of you and Jaeger pushing me around.
Get off him.
He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping. Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.
What happened?
Stop it!
Says they were deserters, they were afraid to fight, don't believe in Saddam anyway. They flew the gunship up here to hide out. When they saw us they figured we were going to kill them, so they shot first.
Says he wanted food. Liar. He wanted the gold.
How's he going to want the gold? He couldn't even know we had it.
I don't care what he says, he wanted our gold. Would have slit our throats if he had the chance.
We can't just leave him. He'll run back to his outfit, report our position...
You said he was a deserter.
That's what he says. He could be a spy, or something.
You don't know that.
You're out of your mind.
He's an enemy soldier.
I'm not going to let you kill him.
We are not at war! You and I and Jaeger are AWOL. We have no authority--
I'm not going to leave him be just so he can stab us in the backs the minute we turn around. I have been through too much to lose it all now just because the two of you don't have the stomach to do what has to be done.
I've got no stomach for murder.
It's a combat action.
It's murder, and I won't be any part of it.
Then step aside.
No.
You've got an awful lot of orders in you. Always giving orders.
I out rank you, that's why.
We been down this road. I told you how it is. Unless you feel like there's something you want to do about it...
No navicom. A lot of good you are now, Epps.
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.
I'm the one's got the big stick.
Suppose I don't go for that?
Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you. I suppose.
What about Jaeger?
In the flack jacket. Still like getting hit in the back with a baseball bat. Took the air right out of me, but I was just unconscious for awhile. 'Course, you didn't stick around to find that out. You left me for dead.
Wes, we thought you were dead, and we thought we were next. Hanging around to get killed wouldn't have done anyone any good.
Sure, and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.
Wes--
Thanks for taking care of this for me.
You disappoint me, Epps. Always figured you to be a man; a real bright guy. I had respect for you.
That why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert.
They'll kill you. You won't make it ten feet before they cut you down.
Just keep quiet.
I have to answer him.
So you can give us away?
Give it to me!
Looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who's better than who, don't we, Epps? Like I said; I expected more from you.
At-at-at-at-at. At-at-at-at-at.
What are you doing?
At-at-at-at-at.
Knock it off!
Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
Ready for what? What are you supposed to be doing?
I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.
You know what? I think you got Schwarzkopf. You did! You got the General right in the ass. Now that's good shooting.
Blow me.
Don't worry about Jaeger. He uses his personality as a form of birth control.
Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that.
There might be something in there.
Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.
This is stupid. It's going on a month now. How long are they going to let the Air Force piss on those bastards? They can bomb them all they want, Saddam ain't going anywhere without a ground assault. What the hell is the army waiting for?
Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?
You all want to lay off? God. I hope the Iraqis shoot me; put me out of my misery.
What!? What!?
You think?
They finally start the ground war, and where are we? Same place we've been since we got here. Securing freedom for the dirt.
Everybody's got a job to do. Figure it this way: At least you get to go home alive.
Don't even. You're not going to show me that tired map.
I think you've got some issues to deal with. Really, when we get out of here I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you.
Just listen to me! I've been doing some reading. In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks. It became part of the Ottoman empire. When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff. Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards. They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes. I
Wellllll, if you read it it must be true. Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer?
And you know what that area is? It's Iraq. IRAQ! We're doing a little thing with them right now; Desert Storm. Maybe you've read about it.
It's war. People get lost all the time in war, cut off--
We disappear for awhile. We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.
It's going to be cool, Wes. It's all all right.
Now this is war.
You're such a pussy, you know that? How'd you get in the army?
But that's the great thing about Gold. A little goes a long way.
Third. What you're going to do with your third.
Yeah. I meant... You know what I'm going to do with it? I'm going to buy a Sixty- three 'Vette Stingray. All tricked out and cherry. I'm going to be so sweet.
You're getting gold, and you're going to blow it on wheels?
What are you going to do with your <u>third</u>?
Invest it.
Oh, that's fun.
It's not about being fun. It's about being smart. You take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. Ever. That's freedom. That's what I'm talking about.
And I'm talking about enjoying myself.
Take the binoculars.
Wh-what do you think--
Shut up! Both of you shut the hell up!
We've got to do something. We've got to turn around.
They'll shoot us!
We run they'll shoot us anyway. If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis. Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
They're not going to--
Figure they don't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them.
Steady it out!
She okay?
Yeah. Yeah, she's fine.
What?
I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing. I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.
You can't tell anybody about this.
It'd make their heads explode.
Look at it. LOOK AT IT! Shot to hell. It's been leaking gas since the fire fight. I told you to check for damage.
...I know.
And you missed this? How are you going to miss something like this?
What do we do with the Humvee?
SAY IT!
Hey...hey! Slow up. You don't have to go so fast.
Faster we get there, faster we get back.
I'm gonna...I'm just gonna stop for a little water.
Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.
What!?
What?
You didn't step on any mine.
I heard it click.
If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now. Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore.
Oh, God! Oh God!
Just be cool.
It's a mine, isn't it?
Just relax.
How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?
Where you going?
Me and Wes are just going to talk.
Why you got to move away to talk!?
We're going to be right over here.
You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!? It's going to blow up!
There's a way.
I said nobody dies. Nobody dies.
My leg is falling asleep.
It's not falling asleep. You've only been standing there for three minutes.
I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
How's this going to work?
Me and Wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine.
You're going to be fine.
When we start running suck up your breath. You're going to get the wind knocked out of you.
You're going to blow yourselves up.
Wes is right. If there were any more mines we would have found them. Hell, that one you stepped on was probably old anyway; left over from the war with Iran.
You don't know that. It could be a trick.
This. Whatever it is.
You're not losing trust, are you?
I didn't have to stop anything, 'cause nobody was going to do nothing. We're in this together, understand?
I don't hear any--
Don't!
It's a fire fight.
Iraqis. A bunch of them.
Well, it's Iraq. I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that has something to do with them being here.
They're doing more than slapping.
Not enough. We're out numbered and out gunned. They'd cut us to shreds.
X marks the spot.
Something like that.
But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something.
Where is it? Where'd it go?
Stay low.
Where the hell is it!?
What are we going to do? What the hell are we going to do?
We're not going to do anything.
They're going to kill us!
If they land--
Think there might be more Iraqis?
A whole lot of nothing.
What are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing?
It looks like you're not doing anything.
I'm not. And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.
Get up and dig.
We've been digging. We've been digging for hours. If there was anything here to find we would have found it.
Must be a compartment.
Maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore.
It's just a mongoose.
Is it dead?
It's not like I figured. It's cold. And it's heavier than I imagined.
I wouldn't know. I never imagined this. Not in my whole life did I ever imagine this.
Wait.
What?
We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?
He's not going to leave us.
Why do I have to stay down here?
Jesus, Jaeger.
I don't see how that plan's any better.
All right. You go up, I'll send up the gold, then follow.
What the hell took so long.
Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line. It didn't seem that long.
Wes might be right about that.
We should head Northeast.
Northeast? That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.
There's another pass on the photo. We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
It should, or it will? Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
What are we going to do? How are we going to find our way back!?
We'll find our way.
How!?
We got to go back. We got to go back for Wes.
Forget Wes.
We can't just leave him.
Wes is dead!
What if he's not?
No.
No.
What do you mean no? They can fly us home.
They'll ask questions; want to know why we were out here.
We'll lie.
First Wes, now you?
I'm not like Wes. Wes was crazy.
And you; you've got it all together.
I don't want it this way. I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me. Not when we're so close.
I'm sorry about that, Epps.
I'm glad I didn't have to kill you. I'm glad it didn't come to that.
Yeah. Well, me too.
I never killed anybody before. I talk a good game, but I'm not like that.
Sure.
Really, I'm not. Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis? That's all it was was talk. I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.
You still got a map on you?
Epps?
Yeah.
I don't want to die.
Makes two of us.
I know what I did just now was crazy, but you got to understand how much I want that gold.
It's all right. I don't like it, but it's over now.
Sorry.
What do you think our chances are?
Wonder how the war's going?
We can't just sit here. We've got to start moving, so pick.
I pick that way.
Getting cold.
It's a desert. That's what deserts do at night; they get cold.
Epps...Epps! I'm gonna stop for a second.
No!
Just let me rest for a second.
We've got to keep moving while there's still light.
You know what I'm going to do? I'm just going to take a second. I want to look at the gold.
Don't you touch it.
I just want to look at it. Remind me of what I'm dying for.
The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.
What do you figure it is?
Place all alone like that? Must be a boarder check point.
Which boarder? Saudi? Kuwait? Syria?
We can head back for our lines, and they don't even have to know about the gold.
Well?
Well, we should identify ourselves.
Even if they are Iraqis probably all they'll do is take us prisoner for awhile. Got to figure we're still kicking their asses in the war. They don't want any trouble.
That's if the war is even still going on. Way things were shaping up it's probably long over.
What did you say?
I don't know. Something Wes had taught me. I think it means "Don't shoot. We're your friends."
Oh, God...
They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them. They couldn't tell in the dark.
Slip out your M-16.
And then what?
And then shoot them.
I...I never killed anyone before. I told you that.
Can't you--
Don't go bitch on me now! You were going to kill me. Kill them!
I just said I would. I don't think I--
An Iraqi?
What do we do?
To where?
What do we do?
What do you make of them?
Shi'ites, I think.
Is that good, or bad?
I don't know. They killed Wes.
Why haven't they killed us!?
I don't know!
...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
With what? Against how many?
We can't just sit here waiting to die.
You come up with a better plan, let me know.
...Wes...?
I didn't say that. I never said--
Can you ride a horse?
Which way do we go!?
Damn it. We lost the horses.
The...the gold...
It wasn't the gold. It was the claymore mine. The gold's in my pack.
When did you make the switch?
It's always been like that. When you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up I figured I'd better...take precautions. I rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack. Just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own.
But...
We had a deal. No one touches the gold until we're out of here. No one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about.
What if it hadn't been Wes? What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had...
Well?
A car's got to come along sooner or later. When it does, we jack it.
How do we do that?
You lie in the middle of the road, look like you're hurt. When the car stops I run over to the driver and put a gun to his head.
Why do I have to lie in the road?
Somebody has to.
Yeah, but why me? What if the car doesn't stop?
Epps.
Yeah.
I want you to know... I don't know. I just think you're a hell of a guy.
Thanks.
This whole time, you've kept your head. You didn't go money simple like me and Wes. You've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here. And you've been fair too. I mean, even after I...you know...
Threatened to blow my brains out?
Yeah. Even after that. You didn't take it out on me, except for maybe making me lie in the middle of the road now. But I'd say you've been very fair. I just think it's a hell of a man who can keep from going money simple.
Epps?
What?
I'm thinking about taking a trip.
Thought you were going to buy a car.
Still am. There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now... Where should I go?
I don't know.
I've never been anywhere. I wouldn't know where to go. Where would you go?
Australia.
What?
I'd go to Australia. Lot of land, not many people. I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile. And the girls go crazy for brothers down there.
Really?
Well, this is it. We get the car, find some Americans. We find Americans we'll be all right.
Epps, I don't think he's slowing down.
He's not slowing.
Woods.
Hey, Jaeger. What's up.
I'm looking for a favor. I need a map of Iraqi.
That shouldn't be too hard to read. Iraq is the pink thing.
Planning on going to war all by your lonesome?
Just...want to be ready when we do.
Ready for what? Sight-seeing?
Some good ones.
They're all good ones. Satellites we've got can snap a shot of the boil on Saddam's ass.
Could you stop, please. You're giving me a headache.
A headache?
Yeah, a headache. My head hurts. You're making me uncomfortable.
I'm making you uncomfortable. Baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that doesn't bother you. But me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull.
Yes. Yes. That's exactly it. Yes.
We ought to kick their asses anyway. Even if they do get out of Kuwait we ought to kick their asses.
I don't think we'll go to war. We shouldn't even be here. This isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict. It should be decided regionally.
People are suffering.
When do you ever point the soles of your feet at people?
I'm saying don't do it accidently.
Come on. You're going to get us in trouble.
It was an accident. You saw it was an accident.
Spanish wasn't hard enough?
What does that mean?
Don't shoot me, I'm friendly. You can use that when you surrender.
How do you say "Come here, baby. I'm horny." I can use that now.
What is this?
Now you need me.
He says it's a box.
Yeah, you're funny.
It's a puzzle box. If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.
And you're the guy who's going to open it.
You get it yet?
Naw, nothing.
You will. You'll get it.
I'll show Epps. He'll be sorry when I get this thing open.
You really think there's a treasure inside?
Jaeger?
What?
You know the fifteenth is the deadline for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait.
Yeah. So?
That's in two days.
Like I said; so?
They're cancelling all leaves, all passes. No more drills. We stand at full ready starting--
What's your point, Wes? You have a point?
We're going to war, aren't we. If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.
It doesn't mean anything.
Jaeger?
What!?
You ever think about dying?
Come on, man. I almost had this thing open.
You ever think about it? You ever worry?
At-at-at-at-at.
This is so weird. It's happening, but it's not. It's like a TV show, and we're part of it.
The longer the air force hits the Iraqis, the safer it'II be for us when we have to engage.
It's...it's...I don't know what it is.
That's it. It's over. Eighteen hours into the war and it's over.
We...we could go home with something else.
What?
You're not saying what I think you're saying. I can't believe you're even thinking it.
It's right here. This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos. There're no troops there, no fighting--
You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to. And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know--
It's about a hundred miles from where we are now. How long do you think it would take us to--
It's not a hundred miles. It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain: Pure desert, mountains, a river. If the map is even real.
It's real. I'm telling you, it's real.
Epps, you're smarter than this. Jaeger I understand, but you're smarter.
You know it's real. You know it's real, and you know it's there. You know it.
God! I don't believe I'm doing this. I don't.
We're going to get court martialed, you know that.
Epps, is that a sand dune.
Hey, Wes, what kind of treasure you figure these people buried?
If! If there's a treasure.
Yeah. If. Whatever. What kind you figure it is?
I don't know. It would be small, easy to transport and hide. Gold or jewels. Probably gold.
Yeah! Gold! How much?
If there's gold. If!
This is too much. You don't even have the money and you're wasting it.
Iraqis.
Oh, God!
Two vehicles. They're not supposed to be here.
Oh, Jesus!
Yeah! Yeah!
I think I'm going to throw up. I am. I'm going to toss.
I thought we were dead.
Yeah, well, we're not.
We have to go back.
We're not going anywhere. Not 'til we get what we came for.
So, you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel? Knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere?
We're not stranded. We've got enough gas in the other reserve to get us back.
Then lets go back while we still can.
You two don't even know how crazy you are. You want to go on your sick, little treasure hunt then go ahead, but mark me absent.
You have to go with us, Wes.
Really? What is that, an order, <u>private</u>?
Epps...
How long we going to keep this up.
Until we're out of the mine field is how long.
Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.
That don't mean nothing. Iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we're in the clear.
If all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself.
I'm getting tired of you riding me, Jaeger.
Jesus! What the hell did he do that for? They're Iraqis. Why are Iraqis killing Iraqis?
Is there anything you do know?
So?
We're American soldiers. We don't abandon people.
Funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold.
You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.
Think we can make it?
Maybe they're as scared of us as we are of them.
What do you think?
It's got a bottom.
You down?
Yeah, we're down.
What the hell are you doing!?
With what? He doesn't have a weapon.
Says he's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter.
Maybe we should give him some water.
All last night he could have been--
I think he wants something to drink.
So we'll take him with us. At least 'til we get back to the Hummer.
Maybe we ought to...you know, bury him. Say some words over him.
You're going to burn up in those.
Think the Iraqi's killed them all?
When my Shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an American they were very apologetic. Turns out we've been kicking ass in this little war. They figure we've finally gotten Saddam off their backs. They brought me to their camp, cleaned me up, fed me... I'm their new best buddy. America number one, Joe. But there's something the Shi'ites can't figure out: They can't
We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there.
I can't hear him.

I'm not hungry.
No, your going to eat it, or it will go to waste.
What's this? Why did you change it?
You've seen enough.
You know I don't feel well.
What did you get?
I have to see SEN. I've just been given a shift change.
When?
Now.
Now?
He wants me to come to his quarters.
I don't know.
Don't go.
I have to... he's a G-34
You don't have to... I don't trust him. You ought to file a report.
Then why did you bring it up?
I haven't done anything.
I've never been under the table before.
Look,dirt!
That's not dirt...Can't be dirt.. Dirt is a violation.
Look, food!
That's not food. Can't be food.
Now...now, I'm sorry...don't - don't....please. It's just... I was happy. Why get me involved? You told SEN that you weren't satisfied with me.
I was so scared...I didn't know what would happen with you...once I started. I almost let you go on so many times. It will be worth it, together. When I was alone, I knew.
What time is it?
What?
I said what time is it? How long was I out?
It's 3+27 hundred
Three! I'm going to be late for my shift.
No! Don't go.
They'll come for me right away if I'm not there. I have to go.
Don't take anything.
I'll try.
What are you doing here? Is anything wrong?
No....I though I'm afraid.
You slipped on a T297 transfer just before lunch, didn't you?
What?
What do you think you're doing? You're going to get us arrested.
I can't go on like this. I can't.... I don't just sit around and watch people. If I make a mistake, it's all over. You see it every day. Do you want to see me taken away in pieces?
What are you doing?
If you....if you go back on sedation, you won't feel the same way about me. You'll report me for drug evasion.
I couldn't turn you in, not now. I....I know I wouldn't!
You don't know. You don't....
If I take something, you suffer. If I don't, I stuff....
I know you can do it without sedation, You can, I know you can.
Then what? It can't go on forever. You know it can't.
It's all right now, shhhh it's all right.
Are you all right?
They know. They've been watching us. I can feel it.
They don't know.
They're watching us now.
no...no, no.
Oh, THX... hold me, hold me, THX holds her tightly, tears in his eyes. They kiss, and LUH hides her head in THX's chest.
It's the end.
I'm not afraid...I'm not afraid.
THX!
Then why are they holding us here? Why don't they destroy us right away? Economically, it's not sound at all. Very much unlike....
You always manage to avoid the issue: What's wrong with our present condition? We're COMFORTABLE and we have plenty of food...I feel absolutely no threat because there is no threat. Why incite trouble? You should examine your emotions. It is senseless...
But we need a creative dissent. Our voices are not joined in any harmonious chorus, but the differences are differences of emphasis, not of fundamentals. Now, the new alignment's greatest need is to communicate with all its elements, rather than march along in parallel line that never converge. Tomorrow as we focus the new movement more clearly, we will gain a new unity.
Good Lord!
There goes another of your disciples.
I thought you were through with it!
What's going on....what are you doing?
We're leaving.
What?
We're leaving.
Who? Who's leaving?
THX and me.
I can just barely see him. I think he's leaving.
He's coming back for the rest of us. He can't make it alone.
Wait! I'll talk to him.
That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
We must escape. We have plans. We can leave. We must wait until...
I can't see him at all. He's been destroyed.
How far did you go? Was it cold?
Well?
Out of a random selection of 150 locations with 150 possible sightings, there were 146 absolute negatives and four conditionals, most of which occurred in the early familiarization stages of the experiment and can be largely discounted.
Not very encouraging.
I've got it! Astounding!
What?
I'm sure it's warmer in her than outside, though. I haven't been out yet, but it usually is...the control is fouled...
Where is LUH?
Why did you have LUH come here?
Why are you so concerned?
What's going on?
I want you for my roommate.
Where's LUH?
I don't understand. Living....selection is computed. You can't... What have you done to LUH? She was here..
We had a long talk and she agreed that it would be a good idea for you to switch. She felt that you had not been accurately mated to her in the first place... You're upsetting yourself. Would you like something?
You're in violation.
I won't have another mate like ONA. You rate very high in sanitation. I've checked. In fact, I am surprised that you were ever matched with LUH. Her ratings are very erratic - you know what I mean. We'll be happy.
What are you doing here? You're not cleared for this area!
You know I have a way with the computers. I can clear myself for any area.....almost.
I'll report you. It's....
Listen to me....You have no need to distrust me. We're going....
I'm leaving.
I'm leaving.
When?.....How?
Right now.
What?
What are you doing here?
I was lost.
...and you're not lost now?
Which way?
How do you know?
We've lost SEN!
What?
Lost SEN! He'll never find us.
...it doesn't matter. The rest of it just didn't happen.
What are you talking about. How do you know? I need her! I need her. She needs me. I've got to get to her.
Maternity ward, huhh!
We'll never make it through that mainway...I wonder what happened to SEN. I'm crazy! This whole thing is crazy...What am I doing? My mind is full of so many things I can't think of anything, anymore. Who are you?
Who? Me?...I don't know.
What kind of answer is that?
I don't know.
You have to!....I'm 1138 THX Magnum manipulator 347 cell 94107 Precinct 3 Residence: Level 6421 Complex 12 Ramp 5. Roommate 3417 LU...H.
Oh, That! I'm 5555 SRT Entron..
What was that....
Must be an expressway.... You don't have to stay here, you know....
What have you done, Cut your hand?
Would you like part of this? ....It's not much.
This one has eyes. Why did they leave your eyes? Could you ever....
I knew him.
Soon he'll be a plastic cube.
That's not it.
She's not there
No...... She's dead THX........
You don't know that!
Remember this...?
Where's LUH?
No...no you're wrong.
I'm sorry.
What do you want?
Just look at all those people.
Yes.
Yes
Yes.
My mate has been acting very strange. I can't explain it.....but. I haven't been feeling very well myself. I don't know, maybe it's me. I needed an SP9 last night. I feel as if something odd were happening to me. Something....
Yes.
....I'm taking SP5, but it doesn't seem strong enough. I have a hard time concentrating. Please forgive me, I slipped on....
....with me? What am I to her or she to me? Nothing. She's an ordinary roommate. I..I share...
Yes...
...rooms with her. Our relationship is normal, conforming. We share nothing but space. What is she doing to...
Yes...
You are engaged in an unauthorized procedure. Check cybernetic manual F-45. If you do no have an F-45, you are in violation. This is a double A restricted precinct. Remain where you are. Authorities will arrive shortly.
May I help you?
I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.
They're not here.
Where are they?
And you are...?
Officer Reilly, vice.
There out on a call, perhaps I can help you-
-Where?
f 2600 block of Lakefront. A limousine. But, I-
Hey, that's the guy-
How's the print coming?
One partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night. Name's Carl Taylor. Long record of arson, assault, the works. The other print - we got nothing from our data base or the FBI or CIA... still waiting for Interpol.
Coffee, Mike?
Dispatch, this is Reilly.
Go ahead.
Patch me through to the Bomb Squad.
Aren't you on suspension?
Just do it.
Who the heck're you?
Where did you get this?
High-grade det cord. This girl, either she's got strange taste in jewelry or she's into serious demolition.
Sorry about that. That's an inch of the stuff, imagine what the whole thing'd do.
Alright, let's check it out.
What're you talking about?
When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department.
What was-? Why...?
What?
This isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery. You wanna work with us, you do it our way, understand?
Now wait just a fucking-
By the way, I'm Glass. This is T.J., and Pooch.
We don't use the b-word. Bad luck.
So you're the "Device Squad"... and you defuse "devices"?
Treat. We treat devices.
Anything else I should know?
I.R.A. device. Deadliest class of tickers in existence. Computerized, multiple sensors, booby traps, the works. First showed up in a series of I.R.A. bombings in London couple years ago. One of their boys tripped it on himself and they went back to a less complicated timers. The Girl, is she Irish?
She's not talking. But, she could be. So, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before?
Only once, at Redstone.
Nice performance back there. Where'd you learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar?
Hey, look--
No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
Oh yeah? Prove it.
The place has already be combed. Forensics pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside.
So what were they doing here?
I don't know. You tell me?
An abandoned machine shop... nice place to build devices. Low rent, too. But, you and Rice ruined their perfect hideout.
You mentioned something called Redstone.
Redstone's the army training center in Alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers.
Cream of the crop, huh? You?
Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.
Sounds like terrorist heaven.
There were a few guys in my class with names like John Smith, Bill Jones. I'd see them up ahead in the hall, call their name, but they wouldn't turn around. C.I.A. Funny thing, they'd always disappear after the first half of the course.
Just how easy is it to build a... device?
Typical profile, usually losers, nobodies that're afraid to confront their victims. They like scaring people. That's why they call in their threats. Same mentality as obscene phone callers.
Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.
This is where the van was parked.
Yep.
Then, it's gotta be here somewhere ...
Look, it's a longshot...
Nitro-cellulose. What is that, some kind of explosive?
How long are we going to stay?
Not bad for Bomb squad, eh?
What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked.
Right.
You guys seem pretty tight.
We've gotta be. In this business, you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments.
Why do you do it?
So cut both.
One shuts it down, one turns arms it.
Which one's which?
How long were you hooked?
What?
Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual.
Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.
I know. I was working a drug ring, deep cover. Played the part too well. When they pulled me out, I wasn't a cop anymore. My fiance had dumped me. Next thing I knew, I was out here on the street, doped up, auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a second chance. He
Your partner?
I terrible with mechanical things.
It's working.
Ex-girlfriend?
What's up?
Where you guys at?
Driving in circles, waiting for-
Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul.
How do you know?
Cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town.
Should we head for the Interstate?
Would you?
No, I'd slip out past the hotel district, behind Greyhound...
Glass, Eighth Street, alley behind Grand Hotel. Cut him off.
Fuck factor?
Off the scale.
Talk to me. Let's assess.
C'mon, talk to me! We can do it!
Good, now the other side.
Nothing.
Keep talking.
Wires... metal, cold... something soft...
More metal... sharp edge...
Something round, two wires ...
That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait...
What's wrong?
Too easy. There's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe.
Yeah, another round thing.
Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down.
Which one's which?
I don't know.
What... ?
When in doubt, pull the yellow wire.
How the hell do you feel yellow?
Assist? What the hell you know about tickers anyway?
What do you think?
Call upstairs, see what you can find out.
Right.
Whadaya mean?
It's from an IRA.
Hey, matches are a very big thing in our line of work.
"Punks", huh?
You got it.
Political.
Any word?
No, we're terrorists, stay back or we'll blow.
Bev, you're the greatest...
Yeah, he's helping us work up a profile on this thing.
We've lost brothers too, we know what that's like.
C4, plastic explosive.
Computer device?
Glass, what is it?
Relax, Pooch, it's just a ticker, it's not personal.
Lane oil...
What do ay say?
Alright!
Jesus...
Cover. It was suppose to be abandoned buildings, y'know. No one was suppose to get hurt. The night you busted us...We were checking to make sure there weren't any vagrants around. Scare them away.
Who is he?
Alex Swan. My brother. The other two are called Taylor and Leveau.
There is a motel downtown, near the Machine Shop... the Suncrest. Room 138.
Thank you.
Then why tell me?
You okay?
Alex-
What is that?
What's the matter?
Why are we stopping here?
No... No more killing.
Stay here.
Alex, please.
Who are you calling, sis?
Alex, please-
Drop it.
I want to work this.
You're vice, not homicide. Besides, you don't have the experience and you're too personally involved.
Looks like the stuff my dad used to use to blow up tree stumps back in Scranton.
What the hell was that?
You touch me again and--
You were lucky today, vice boy. Captain said to leave it alone, but just remember, I'm watching you.
Prints?
Nothing so far.
What about the ballistics report?
It's a bluff. The guy's full of crap.
What the hell's going on?
Son-of-a-bitch... my nose... This fuck-up is interfering with-
I'm filing charges against that mother-
He is!
Nitro, dash of Semtrex, vegetable oil ...
Unsolved bombings in the last year... Boston, New York, Philadelphia... but no real match
How're you guys doing?
Mike. No thanks, I'm fine.
That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that.
Vice... Jesus.
Pooch, can you move it?
Good boy, Schnoz. Daddy loves you.
Fuckin A, I think I got two partial prints here!
That's one more time than any of the rest of us have seen it.
Oh shit...
Know what the problem is, kid? You're too ugly to get propositioned.
Look who's talking, old man.
Next week we work the park.
I gotta get back on top. Get off the sleaze detail.
So what'll you do? After they give you the gold watch.
Hell, I got a gold watch... it just don't work. Maybe they'll give me a new fishing pole, or something useful.
You don't fish.
How hard can it be? The grand kids been buggin' me about taking them camping.
You outta the city... that's a fish out of water. What's with all this family talk lately, anyway?
One of these days you're gonna get tired of fighting the shit. When that happens, you'll wish you had family.
Why don't you just shoot it and put it out of its misery?
What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty.
I thought you said what's-her-name's brother was going to fix it.
She didn't work out, had to cut her loose.
What was it this time?
We're vice, I didn't see no pimps or hookers in that van. But if you're so gung-ho, we'd best call it in for some back-up.
You okay?
Mike...
Don't talk.
It don't work-
Reilly, Vice. I-
Make an appointment.
P.E.T.N ...
Vice cop on a homicide?
Device.
A what?
Got it! Ace Match Company, Flint, Michigan.
T.J., what're you doing?
So what're we looking for?
Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
Looks like Pooch's doing okay.
Nice to be here.
Captain...
Reilly, what the hell happened out there? Why didn't you call for back-up?
Take it down to the Bomb Squad, Artie-
What?
I'll do it.
Goddamit, Reilly--
Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them.
I know you're anxious to get back but... just stay out of homicide's way or I'll have you classifying fingerprints, understand?
Sir...
What's this?
Report on the case so far.
You know after a shooting I would normally take your badge and weapon, but Glass called in already and confirmed it was clean.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
She's refused to say a word to anyone. What made you think you could get her to talk?
Glass, sorry about Pooch, he was a good man. We don't have time to give you a break right now, we're going ahead and-
My God, you're going to use her, aren't you?
Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
I promised her she'd be safe.
It's our only option.
It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business-
I know.
Reilly, what the hell are you-?
Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard.
Reilly, what's happening? Reilly! Reilly! Do not engage. We're five minutes-
What? I may lose it again? But I haven't found it yet! I'm sorry. Goodbye! Yes?
So you lost a handbag, madame?
Yes.
And it had diamonds in the back.
Yes.
And diamonds in the front.
Yes.
Diamonds all over.
Well, have you found it?
M'sieu Laval, Madame would like to talk to Mademoiselle Gautier for a moment.
Pardon me, m'sieu. Madame Colet would like to see you in the living room.
M'sieu Laval, M'sieu Filiba would like very much to see you.
on staircase; from Gaston's point of view. He stops.
Yes, M'sieu Laval?
M'sieu Giron is downstairs.
Tell M'sieu Giron I can't see him now. Impossible! And, Jacques. Dismiss the car! Madame is not going.
still studying the vase. Mariette appears. He turns to her.
Is this what you mean, M'sieu Laval?
No!
Eleven o'clock!
With the compliments of Colet and Company!
The representative of the police wants to know how much money you had, M'sieu Filiba.
Why did you let this man in, M'sieu Filiba?
And then what happened, M'sieu Filiba?
The representative of the police wants to know if there is anything wrong with your tonsils.
No!
<u>Niente!</u>
What did you talk about?
About tonsils.
<u>Tonsili!</u>
Pardon me, m'sieu, but I have the feeling we have met somewhere before.
I'm sorry, but I don't seem to recall the occasion. No, I'm afraid ...
Yes, M'sieu Filiba?
I wanted to say goodbye to you.
Goodbye, M'sieu Filiba.
But before I say goodbye I want to ask you one question: Have you ever been in Venice?
No.
You've <u>never</u> been in Venice?
No ... Have <u>you</u> ever been in Vienna?
No.
Amsterdam?
No.
Constantinople?
No.
You've never been in Constantinople?
No!
But you <u>have</u> been in Venice?
Yes!
Let me tell you, Venice <u>can't</u> <u>compare</u> with Constantinople.
But--
I don't care <u>what</u> you say! In Constantinople at least you have streets, sultans, pashas--
And harems ... ?
Good morning, Major.
Nice day, Major.
Umm.
You're looking fine, Major.
No doubt about it--it's that secretary.
Funny, the kind of men women fall for.
No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
The type they marry.
You know, I'm not the marrying type. I like to take my fun and leave it.
Nice suit.
Like it?
Smart. London, eh?
Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.
He's really not a bad fellow.
Just dull.
Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.
Funny--the first time I saw him I thought he was a doctor!
Yes, sir? What shall we start with, Baron?
Oh, yes ... Well, that's not so easy. Beginnings are always difficult.
Yes, Baron.
If Casanova suddenly ... turned out to be Romeo ... having supper with Juliet--who might become Cleopatra ... How would you start?
I would start with cocktails.
It must be the most marvelous supper. We may not eat it, but it must be marvelous.
Yes, Baron.
And, waiter--you see that moon?
Yes, Baron.
I want to see that moon in the champagne.
Yes, Baron. Moon in champagne.
I want to see--
Yes, Baron.
And as for you, waiter--
Yes, Baron?
I don't want to see you at all!
No, Baron! I beg your pardon.
You're not safe anywhere nowadays.
But please, Baron. We're not supposed to breathe a word of it. You won't tell anybody I told you?
You can trust me.
M'sieu Laval, there are several things I've wanted to ask you for quite a while. I understand you are from Marseilles.
Um-hum ...
You must be related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
I hope you find the figures correct.
I hope so, too.
M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the confidence of this family--
For more than forty years. So Madame told me.
And you, M'sieu Giron, seem to be disturbing my examination of <u>this</u> <u>report</u>.
Examination! M'sieu Laval, what are you insinuating? I have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. How long have you enjoyed Madame's confidence? Three weeks, I believe.
Two weeks and three days.
Um-hum!
Are <u>you</u> insinuating anything, M'sieu Giron?
No, not at all!
Well, that's fine. Then you are not insinuating that I am avoiding questions. And I am not insinuating that you won't let me examine this report.
I was only asking if you are related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
And I was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption.
I don't see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown.
And I don't see any reason for any man getting nervous when somebody checks over the figures of his report.
Are you insinuating that this is not an honest report?
I am only insinuating that you are nervous.
Nervous! Why should I be nervous?
I'm very sorry, but this is no time, M'sieu Giron--
I've got to see you.
But not now.
Right now! It's very important, M'sieu Laval.
It may be important to you, M'sieu Giron--
Yes, m'sieu.
And you will be out by tomorrow morning.
Very well, m'sieu.
Otherwise I'll call the police
Yes, m'sieu. M'sieu Giron!
What is it?
You have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. You must be a man of about-- about sixty-five. Let's see-- You will be exactly eighty-seven when you come out of prison.
What do you mean?
You say I am a crook.
I know it!
Then why didn't you call the police? Why <u>don't</u> you call the police? I'll tell you why--you crook, you.
M'sieu ...
Monescu.
M'sieu Monescu!
You see, the bag has just been found, and the reaction of relief from her former excitement and strain is just a little too much for her. It's not very serious, but just the same we'd better not take any chances.
Just as you say, Doctor.
Thank you, Major.
Good day, Doctor.
No, no, no! I disagree with you absolutely. That's the trouble with you artillery men.
Now just a minute, Major--
Who?
The Marquis de la Tours. He was in the lobby. But I don't think he saw me. I'm positive he didn't. Thank heaven! ... But when I came up here, right out in the hall there was King Boris of Alconia!
The tennis player?
The tennis player. He saw me. He bowed. What could I do? I nodded. Baron, I shouldn't have come!
Do you <u>know</u> King Boris?
No--no.
Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?
I would like to.
You'd better not. He's really very dull. But anyhow, when the king tells the marquis he saw me, the marquis will tell the marchesa. And the marchesa is the best friend of the Duchess of Chambro. And <u>she</u> will phone the Princess de Costa. The princess doesn't like me--but I don't care!
Why should you?
Don't stop. Keep right on complaining. It's beautiful.
You know, when I first saw you, I thought you were an American.
Thank you!
Someone from another world--so entirely different. One gets so tired of one's own class--princes and counts and dukes and kings--ah! And everybody talking shop--always trying to sell jewelry ... And then I heard your name and found you were just one of us.
Disappointed?
That's hotel life. In one room a man loses his wallet and in another room a man loses-- his head.
Please. When I came here it was for a little adventure--a little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow. But something has changed me--and it isn't the champagne. The whole thing is new to me. Very new. I've got a confession to make to you. Baron, you are a crook. You robbed the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine. May I
Please.
Thank you.
The pepper, too?
No, thank you.
I like you, Baron.
Thank you, Baron.
Not at all, Countess ... There's one very good stone in it.
Darling! Now tell me--tell me all about yourself. Who are you?
You remember the man who walked into the Bank of Constantinople and walked out <u>with</u> the Bank of Constantinople?
Monescu!
Gaston Monescu.
I always liked him. Especially last year in Munich ...
Last year? It can't be that long.
Darling, then let's be honest and return it to the lady.
And take the twenty thousand francs ...
Right.
Sweetheart, what day is today?
The fourteenth of May.
And tomorrow is the fifteenth. And the day after tomorrow--
We'll go to Venice, to the same hotel!
We'll take the Royal Suite!
Two fifty-three, five--
Seven and nine!
And we'll celebrate the second anniversary of the day we didn't get married!
--the other half, contrary to custom, shall be delivered in cash into Madame's personal custody. Darling, that means that on the second of June we'll have eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
And her <u>jewelry</u> is worth a fortune!
You! And she's willing to pay as high as fifty francs!
What?
<u>This</u> <u>woman</u> <u>has</u> <u>more</u> <u>than</u> <u>jewelry</u>.
Ah!
Did you ever take a good look at her--uh--
Certainly!
They're all right, aren't they?
Beautiful. And what of it? Let me tell you something: so far as I'm concerned, her whole sex appeal is in that safe!
Gaston. Let's open it--right now! Let's get away from here! I don't like this place!
Oh, no, darling. There's <u>more</u> sex appeal coming on the first of the month. It's only ten days ... Eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
Filiba ...
Yes--Filiba! Venice--Grand Hotel-- room two fifty-three--
Five, seven, and nine--
Éysée seven, eight, nine, two. We have to clear out. Railroad station? Ticket office, please.
He recognized you!
No--not yet--but-- Two tickets to Berlin--first class and sleeper--night train ... Right ... Right ... Leave them in the name of--Don Ignacio Fernandez ... Right ... Thank you.
Spanish passports?
Correct. Now the train leaves--
At twelve twenty. I know. Lyons two, four, seven, one. Two more days and we'd have seven hundred and fifty thousand francs more!
Well, we'll have to take what's here. A bird in hand is worth two in jail.
Hello ... Is this the Spanish consulate? This is Doña Ignacio Fernandez. My husband and I are leaving tonight for Berlin ... Is it too late to get a visa this afternoon ... ? Thank you, thank you. How long will it take you?
I don't know. Fortunately, she has a dinner engagement tonight. I'll meet you at the station--midnight. Hello ... Yes? What? ... You found a handbag? Well, you're three weeks too late!
Well, see you at the Berlin Express.
By the way, how is your German?
<u>Grossartig</u>--<u>kolossal</u>!
<u>Also</u>, <u>um</u> <u>zwoelf</u> <u>Uhr</u>.
<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
Are you insane? You've to get out of here at once! She may come back any minute.
What time is your rendezvous?
Now, Lily--
Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
You <u>have</u> to get out of here!
That's what I'm here for--to get out! I want to get away from here, from you--as fast as I can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me. Sixty-five, ninety-four--
Don't you <u>realize</u>--
Thirty-five to the left--sixty- three, eight ... I wouldn't fall for another man if he were the biggest crook on earth ... Seventy-six, eighty-four, fifty-five-- What has she got that I haven't got?
Lily, you must listen to me.
Shut up! Don't make up any stories!
But, Lily--
And you--
Lily--
Goodbye--Madame Colet and Company!
Yes...?
Will you be good enough to look at this bag, madame?
You know the main staircase in the opera?
Yes.
Then you go to the left. There's a landing.
Yes.
Then you go into the foyer.
Yes.
And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
I know that niche.
And in that niche, there is a statue of Venus.
I remember.
You like that statue?
Not particularly.
Neither do I. That's where I found it.
I don't know how I could have lost it there. I was nowhere near that niche.
Oh ... That's strange. Maybe--are you sure this is your bag?
Of course it is! Are you doubting me?
Not in the least, madame. But you see, it's a very expensive bag--one has to be careful.
Well--I am Madame Colet.
Well--how do you do, M'sieu Laval?
One purse-- empty. One vanity case--
But really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.
Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue? Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- Oh, yes, this letter from Major--
Oh! You didn't read it!
Naturally I did.
Oh!
You needn't be embarrassed, madame. A lady as charming as you would, and <u>should</u>, get love letters.
M'sieu Laval!
But one suggestion, madame. Not the major. I don't mind his grammatical mistakes. I'll overlook his bad punctuation. But the letter has no mystery--no bouquet--no ... And one lipstick ... Scarlet number four.
What's wrong now?
With your skin, I prefer crimson.
Too much blue in crimson.
That's what you need!
No, no, no! I disagree with you completely! I tried it once--
What shade of powder do you use?
Peaches and cream.
That's too dark.
Do you realize I have light eyes?
Goodbye, M'sieu La-- Oh, yes ... This is a rather delicate matter and I don't want to ... You see, if you read my advertisement carefully, you must have noticed that there was ...
In other words, madame, it embarrasses you to offer me the twenty thousand francs reward.
Yes.
Don't be embarrassed, madame. I'll take it. I need the money. I wish I were in a position to ignore the whole matter. But you know, madame, the stock market, bank crash ... To make a long story short--a member of the nouveaux poor.
Do you know my first name?
And do you know what I'd like to have you do with that check?
What?
Make it out to cash!
Eighteenth century.
Yes!
Early eighteenth century. I should say around--seventeen thirty.
Right!
Beautiful specimen.
It <u>is</u> beautiful. But I got a little tired of sleeping in antiques, so I gave it to my secretary.
Oh?
This used to be my secretary's room.
I see. She must have been very happy here.
Too happy. That's why I discharged her.
But, madame, you keep a hundred thousand francs--in your safe--at <u>home</u>?
You think that's too much?
No! Not enough! In times like these, when everything is uncertain, every conservative person should have a substantial part of his fortune within arm's reach.
Madame Colet, I think you deserve a scolding. First, you lose your bag--
Then I mislay my checkbook--
Then you use the wrong lipstick--
And how I handle my <u>money</u>!
It's disgraceful!
Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is wrong?
Everything! ... Madame Colet, if I were your father-- which, fortunately, I am not--
Ye-es?
And you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs, I would give you a good spanking--in a business way, of course.
What would you do if you were my <u>secretary</u>?
The same thing.
Madame.
Will you be good enough to run through these papers with M'sieu Giron?
I'll be delighted.
Yes, madame?
What are you going to do with my day tomorrow, M'sieu Laval?
Well, we'll have breakfast in the garden.
Um-hum ...
Then riding together.
Um-hum ...
Then lunch in the Bois--
Together.
Then a little nap--
How do you like my dress?
Beautiful.
Hair?
Marvelous.
Crimson!
Correct! Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
But you have an engagement, and I don't want people to talk.
Talk? About me--about us?
Precisely.
Afraid I'm ruining your reputation, M'sieu Laval?
No--yours, madame.
But incidentally, let me tell you, <u>I</u> don't like <u>you</u>. I don't like you at all! I wouldn't hesitate one instant to ruin <u>your</u> reputation--like that!
You would?
Yes, I would!
Like that?
Like that!
I know all your tricks.
And you're going to fall for them.
So you think you can get me?
Any minute I want!
You're conceited--
But attractive--
<u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--
I want you to stay, Mariette. You've <u>got</u> to stay. You can't go now!
I <u>must</u> go.
I'm crazy about you!
I know it.
<u>I</u> <u>love</u> <u>you</u>.
I <u>believe</u> you.
Then why do you want to go?
When a lady takes her jewels off in a gentleman's room, where does she put them?
On the night table.
Ah, let me have a little fun.
Thirty-three--
Yes, Gaston?
What would you say if you found your safe had been robbed?
I wouldn't say anything--I would act.
Call the police?
Instantly.
Um-<u>hum</u> ...
You look beautiful.
Thank you. Seventy-six, eighty--
Mariette!
Yes, Gaston?
You have been robbed--for years. And not a hundred thousand francs, but millions. And you know who did it? Adolph.
<u>Adolph</u>?
Adolph J. Giron.
And you expect me to believe that?
Why not? He's a thief--he's a criminal.
I don't believe it!
It would be a terrible scandal, wouldn't it?
Giron...!
Goodbye...
Goodbye.
It could have been marvelous ...
Divine ...
Wonderful ... But tomorrow morning, if you should wake out of your dreams and hear a knock, and the door opens, and there, instead of a maid with a breakfast tray, stands a policeman with a warrant--then you'll be glad you're alone.
But it could have been glorious.
Lovely.
Divine ... But that terrible policeman!
Oh, M'sieu Laval ...
Yes, Madame Colet?
Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone?
Yes--uh--
Oh, that's too bad. You see, I wanted her to do something. Well, I guess I'll have to do it myself.
What is it, madame?
Oh, no, it's the way you lead.
No, madame, it's the way you <u>follow</u>.
No, m'sieu!
Yes, madame!
But my dear M'sieu Giron, I'm having a tea party. Must I be bothered with all these papers now?
I'm sorry, madame, but there are still certain matters which I think you should attend to yourself. And I, personally, would not care to refer them to--to--
Madame Colet, I've enjoyed the confidence of your family for more than forty years. I was a school friend of your husband's ...
I know!
Madame, let me ask you: Who is M'sieu Laval, anyhow? Where does he come from? What is he?
He is my secretary! I hope that answers all your questions, M'sieu Giron.
You know what Paris is saying about the Countess Falconier and her chauffeur?
You've had your breakfast--oh, but of course you have.
Yes, madame. You see, I have to get up very early. My little brother goes to school-- You see, Mother is dead.
Two lumps, madame?
Please! Thank you.
Yes, madame?
You see-- Oh, not a word to M'sieu Laval!
About what?
Potatoes. He doesn't want me to eat them-- and naturally I don't want to upset him.
Now. Uh--mademoiselle--in the short time you have been M'sieu Laval's secretary, have you noticed any change in him?
Well--uh--yes and no.
To me he seems rather nervous.
Nervous? Um-hum. He smokes too much!
No, he <u>works</u> too much. He's chained to his desk. Too much detail. Now, if you could take over some of his work--
So he wouldn't be confined so much to his office--
Yes! And he would have a little more time for--
For all the really important things--
Right!
I'll do my best, madame, even if I have to work every night.
Oh, no, no, no, no, my dear child! That's ridiculous. You go home as usual--five o'clock every day. Now I'm going to be a little bit of a tyrant--I insist. It'll be nice for your little brother, too. <u>Five</u> <u>o'clock</u>--remember!
Yes, madame?
Well, in times like these most people are cutting salaries, but suppose we say, in your case, three hundred and fifty?
I think you'd better go.
Ever had a romance with a crook?
I beg your pardon!
Let me give you a little advice. When you embrace him, be sure to put on your gloves. It would be too bad if your fingerprints were found ...
Mademoiselle Gautier--or whatever your name is--I thank you for your advice, but I must ask you to go. You've got your money--
You should be ashamed of yourselves. Two men of your standing, always quarreling.
He started it.
But you're the more intelligent one.
That's true.
Then why did you do it?
Because I hate him--because I love you!
You should have more self-control. You were in the army.
Your bag?
Yes, my bag!
Didn't you take it with you?
Apparently not. Don't you know where it is?
No--I'm sorry.
But you saw it here.
Yes, I saw it--but--
Water 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes... in the forepeak... in all three holds... and in boiler room six.
That's right.
Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.
The pumps --
How much time?
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.
Mr. Andrews, I did the sum in my head, and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned... forgive me, but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard.
I saw the iceberg, Mr. Andrews. And I see it in your eyes. Please tell me the truth.
The ship will sink.
You're certain?
Please tell only who you must, I don't want to be responsible for a panic. And get to a boat quickly. Don't wait. You remember what I told you about the boats?
Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone under arrest?!
What? You have to get to a boat right away!
No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer.
Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage, then make a right.
Bottom, left, right. I have it.
Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?
Good luck to you, Rose.
I'm in the sitting room. Heading for bedroom B-54.
Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.
Who's the best? Say it.
Shit.
You know, boss, this happened to Geraldo and his career never recovered.
She says she's Rose DeWitt Bukater, right? Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the Titanic. At the age of 17. If she'd've lived, she'd be over a hundred now.
A hundred and one next month.
We've put together the world's largest database on the Titanic. Okay, here...
So let me get this right. You were gonna kill yourself by jumping off the Titanic? That's great!
Holy shit.
Don't drop it Rose.
Rush her.
Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.
Don't you mean work me?
Look, I'm running out of time. I need your help.
I'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and one year old grandmother. I came down here to tell you to back off.
What?
That's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand? I'm not leaving here without it.
The partners want to know how it's going?
There's a satellite call for you.
Bobby, we're launching. See these submersibles here, going in the water? Take a message.
This is Brock Lovett. What can I do for you, Mrs...?
Rose Calvert.
I told you you wanted to take this call.
None of the stewards have seen her.
She's not on the starboard side either.
We're running out of time. And this strutting martinet... ...isn't letting any men in at all.
The one on the other side is letting men in.
I make my own luck.
We're too late.
What could possible be funny?
Your daughter is much too hard to impress, Ruth. Mind your step.
So this is the ship they say is unsinkable.
Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath.
Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.
You know I don't like that, Rose.
It's just the God damned English doing everything by the book.
You told me to change.
I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck.
Those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money.
You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without logic. What's his name again...? Picasso.
What made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee?! Look at me, you filth! What did you think you were doing?!
Cal, stop! It was an accident.
An accident?!
I was leaning way over, to see the... ah... propellers. And I slipped and I would have gone overboard... and Mr. Dawson here saved me and he almost went over himself.
Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love?
My God... Cal. Is it a --
It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the --
I had hoped you would come to me last night.
I was tired.
Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.
I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.
You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?
Something serious has happened.
But I was with him the whole time.
Oh, Mother shut up! Don't you understand? The water is freezing and there aren't enough boats... not enough by half. Half the people on this ship are going to die.
Where are you going? To him? Is that it? To be a whore to that gutter rat?
Yes, I lived. How awkward for you.
Is this in any way unclear?
What do I tell your mother?
You're precious to me, Rose.
I know. Perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow, to regale our group with your heroic tale?
Sure. Count me in.
This should be amusing.
Just a soupcon of lemon... ...it improves the flavor with champagne.
No thanks. I'm heading back.
There are boats on the other side that are allowing men in. Jack and I can get off safely. Both of us.
I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch.
You're a good liar.
Almost as good as you.
Let's see... Fabrizio's got niente. Olaf, you've got squat. Sven, uh oh... two pair... mmm. Sorry Fabrizio.
What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo --
'Cause you're goin' to America!! Full house boys!
Goin' home... to the land o' the free and the home of the real hot- dogs! On the TITANIC!! We're ridin' in high style now! We're practically goddamned royalty, ragazzo mio!!
You know somebody?
How you two doin'?
The boats are all going.
You can smell ice, you know, when it's near.
Bollocks.
Cor... look at that, would ya.
They're a bloody sight warmer than we are.
Oy, mate... that was a close shave.
Keep pulling... away from the ship. Pull.
The suction will pull us right down if we don't keep going.
We got room for lots more. I say we go back.
They'll pull us right down I tell ya!
I don't understand a one of you. What's the matter with you? It's your men back there! We got plenty a' room for more.
So you've not lit the last four boilers then?
No, but we're making excellent time.
Captain, the press knows the size of Titanic, let them marvel at her speed too. We must give them something new to print. And the maiden voyage of Titanic must make headlines!
I prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in.
Why have we stopped?
We've struck ice.
Well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?
Take my hand. I'll pull you back in.
No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
No you won't.
What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don't know me.
You're distracting me. Go away.
I can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you.
The fall alone would kill you.
How cold?
Ever been to Wisconsin?
No.
Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were ice- fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice- fishing's where you chop a hole in the --
I know what ice fishing is!
Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain. Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after
You're crazy.
I'm Jack Dawson.
HELP! HELP!!
Hello again.
Could I speak to you in private?
So, you got a name by the way?
Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.
Mr. Dawson, I --
Jack.
Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.
Well, here you are.
Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion.
You're welcome. Rose.
Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?
That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.
I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was their whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber. I just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at the back rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough. Not enough to
Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
That penguin last night, is he one of them?
Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.
Is he your boyfriend?
So you feel like you're stuck on a train you can't get off 'cause you're marryin' this fella.
Yes, exactly!
So don't marry him.
If only it were that simple.
It is that simple.
Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.
What's this?
Just some sketches.
Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are.
Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly!
And these were drawn from life?
You liked this woman. You used her several times.
She had beautiful hands.
I think you must have had a love affair with her...
No, no! Just with her hands.
You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.
And...?
You know, my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become an artist... living in a garret, poor but free!
You wouldn't last two days. There's no hot water, and hardly ever any caviar.
Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head.
I'm sorry. Really... I am.
So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?
Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.
A whole ten cents?!
Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.
Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it. Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?
Sure. If you like.
I think I would. And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair.
I saw that in a nickelodeon once, and I always wanted to do it.
Jack, must you go?
May I cut in, miss?
I don't know the steps.
You're not one of them. There's been a mistake.
A mistake?
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
I did, didn't I? Look! A shooting star.
That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven.
Rose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under that you're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girl I've ever known and --
Jack, I --
You're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really.
I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.
You're right. Only you can do that.
Fabrizio said you might be up --
Will this light do? Don't artists need good light?
Cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere.
Should I be expecting him anytime soon?
What is it? A sapphire?
I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing.
Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.
He's an ex-Pinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch, after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town...
Where to, Miss?
Are you nervous?
You're trembling.
When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you.
This is crazy.
Looks okay. I don't see anything.
Could it have damaged the ship?
It's bad.
We have to tell Mother and Cal.
Now it's worse.
Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
This is horseshit.
Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!
That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket.
I know, I know.
So... how did you find out I didn't do it?
You have to go for help.
I'll be right back.
Will this work?
I'm not going without you.
You jump, I jump, right?
Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything.
It's so cold.
It's getting quiet.
No... don't say your good-byes, Rose. Don't you give up. Don't do it.
I'm so cold.
You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?
I can't feel my body.
You must do me this honor... promise me you will survive... that you will never give up... no matter what happens... no matter how hopeless... promise me now, and never let go of that promise.
I promise.
Never let go.
I don't think I've ever seen such a flat calm, in 24 years at sea.
Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.
It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.
Mmmmm. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller.
Yes sir.
April 14, 1912.
Wait! Can you give us something go on, here. Like who had access to the safe. What about this Lovejoy guy? The valet. Did he have the combination?
Maybe she wants to make peace with the past.
What past? She has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on the Titanic until two days ago.
Then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.
You think she was really there?
I'm sorry.
Is your stateroom alright?
There, that's nice. I have to have my pictures when I travel. And Freddy of course. Isn't that right, sweetie.
Would you like anything?
Louis the Sixteenth wore a fabulous stone, called the Blue Diamond of the Crown, which disappeared in 1792, about the time Louis lost everything from the neck up. The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too... recut into a heart-like shape... and it became Le Coeur de la Mer. The Heart of the Ocean. Today it would be worth more than the
I tracked it down through insurance records... and old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy. Do you know who the claiment was, Rose?
Someone named Hockley, I should imagine.
It's been 84 years...
Just tell us what you can --
I can still feel its weight. If you could have felt it, not just seen it...
Rose, tell us more about the diamond. What did Hockley do with it after that?
Don't come any closer.
My God, Rose, what's gotten into --
Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson.
Rose, this is not a game! Our situation is precarious. You know the money's gone!
Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!
I don't understand you. It is a fine match with Hockley, and it will insure our survival.
Do you want to se me working as a seamstress? Is that what you want? Do you want to see our fine things sold at an auction, our memories scattered to the winds? My God, Rose, how can you be so selfish?
It's so unfair.
Rose, get in the boat!
Anya!
Anya, I think you're crazy.
Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.
Then why the sudden exit without even telling me?
Do you want the truth, Anya?
It would be a nice change from you.
I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
You're a charming liar. You <U>know</U>, Herbert's too dull to be suspicious about anything--even when I suddenly decided to come to Europe at a few hours' notice--
How'd you ever get away with it?
When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
Sure!
Here's to Europe! Couldn't try to look a little less glum, could you?
Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.
But, Anya, dear! Unless you play we won't have a fourth.
Hope we're not intruding.
This is Miss Marsh.
Well--shall we go into dinner?
I'll join you later.
So that's your little dancer that you were playing around with in New York. Oh--there's no accounting for tastes-- Mine, too, seem to be in the gutter.
I can explain--
Don't look so uncomfortable, Lee--it interferes with your good looks. Give me a cigarette. What did you do--persuade her to come on this voyage with you?
Don't talk such bunk! She's one of the acts on the ship. I just ran into her by accident.
Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?
You mind your own business! She's an old friend of mine and I like her--what're you going to do about it?
Just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.
I didn't ask you to come away with me--
Oh--a hundred times--
--and I can tell you where to get off.
And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert. Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you. You're such a swine!
Will you leave me alone?
I like touching you--poison ivy. You'd just been kissing that girl when I came in, hadn't you?
Baloney!
I can think of nothing nicer. It's very kind of you to invite me--
Feeling a little better, I see.
Thanks. I'll be there. About seven-thirty?
Good afternoon--
I hope so.
Will you please excuse me? I'll be right back.
We'll save you a place at our table.
Isn't she lovely?
No--I'm furious!--Nobody seems to do anything about it--
How do you do. Would you care to finish the game? I have a slight earache. --and it's so noisy up here.
You're Anya Rosson, aren't you? I've heard of you back in New York.
Sorry I can't return the compliment.
You were indiscreet enough to leave your gloves in my apartment one evening-- --and he was gentleman enough to boast <U>why</U> you'd been there and show me a snapshot of you.
I don't understand.
A rare pleasure to meet you, ma'am! Where I come from --out in Montana--we have some pretty women, but I guess if you walked down Main Street they'd turn out the fire brigade.
Montana?
--that's what we call double-a grade lumber, ma'am; You don't find a knot in a thousand feet.
You'll excuse me.
Will you pardon me?
You're lucky--out my way, in Montana, there's nothing else to do--
Did you find it?
No!--Did <U>you</U> take that bracelet?
No-o!
Where'd you get it?
Lifted it out of a guy's cabin last night.
What did you want a gun for?
Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.
Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
Guess again, copper.
Hmm! So am I. If you'll excuse me I have some important unfinished business. I'll see you all later.
We haven't any chips, Mr. Brett--Do you mind playing with cash?
Well, I'm off to a pretty good start.
I should pass, but I'll trail along--I'll take three.
Aces full.
You're coming back--
How about a little game later?
Could I see you a minute?
No gentleman would do that.
In that case--you owe us exactly sixteen hundred dollars.
Oh, no--I played with <U>your</U> cards--in <U>your</U> cabin--at <U>your</U> suggestion--If you've got a kick coming, make it to the Purser.
And I'll lay odds you got that bracelet.
I'm so sorry!
I thought you were one of my friends.
I'd <U>like</U> to be. Sailing on the <U>Progress?</U>
Yes--are you?
I wouldn't miss this boat for a million.
She looks like a lot of other boats. I grant you she's beautiful.
I'll say she is!
Nice lines--
Like her paint job?
Very much--
You've got lipstick all over you.
I could stand some more--
--You'll have all the boys tipping their hats to you-- --let me wipe it off.
Where have you been hiding?
Oh--hello! I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.
Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?
So you washed it off!
How about giving me another coat?
Good-by.
Wait a minute!--They're dancing in the palm court--
Good-by!
There's soft music--
--sorry--got an appointment to play shuffle-board.
This is great. I'll be able to watch your act every night.
You're not very ambitious, are you?
Oh, yes, I am, because <U>afterwards</U>--up here in the moonlight.
You work too fast for me, young man.
Aw--give a feller a break. My cards are on the table-- I want to know you. How about dining with me tonight?
Never eat before the show.
This is Mr.--er--
Brett is the name.
Don't stop, nurse--I think I'm going to faint.
You <U>are</U> a lunatic!
You know, you're not a <U>bad</U>-looking girl. In fact--I think you're lovely.
Keep your eyes on the ball, Mister.
Married?
Nothing to speak of. What is this--third degree?
I want you to get used to my voice--you're going to hear it a lot.
What a horrible death! Do you know what you remind me of?
Tell me.
A little boy that has escaped from his nurse and--
Isn't she attractive?
Very--your mother?
Don't be a c-a-t.
You asked me to dine with you tonight.
Yes?
Well, I can't.
Don't rub it in.
But I'll have cocktails with you.
When?
At seven-thirty?
Sooner it you like.
Okay.
Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.
See you at seven-thirty in the lounge.
I'm sorry I'm late, but something happened.
You're forgiven if you don't make dates with anybody except me for the rest of the voyage.
A little.
Sorry.
Thanks.
Mighty decent of you, pal.
What are you thinking?
A lot of things I'd like to forget.
That's funny--so was I. Guess the ocean makes one sentimental
I can't blame the ocean--it's you.
Don't kid me. I'm in no mood for it.
For once I'm dead on the level-- --crazy about you!
Will you take some advice? If you're looking for romance--count me out-- --if you know what's good for you.
But--
--I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon. Guess I'll be going.
Sally--!
Let's forget it--can't you see I kind of like you, too ... and I don't want to get involved.
You mean that?
Don't let's talk about it.
Would you like to take a turn around the deck with me?
Yes--is it all right if I come like this?
This time I'm really glad you showed up.
Lonesome?
What, again?
Yes--you know what I've been thinking, Sally?--
What?--
I think we'll live in Europe after we're married?
I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.
You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--
You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring--
I'll give you plenty of rings as soon as I get the stones set--what do you think?
Good night, Mrs. Brett!
I could see you were pining away--
Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?
How well do you know her?
Just met her on the boat--supposed to play bridge with her yesterday--but she wouldn't--so we played poker instead.
Who with?
A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother.
Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
Lose?--I won a little--
That was the come-on--promise me you won't play with them again--
What do you know about them?
Too much--Remember--I warned you about me-- I used to be Lee Lother's girl--
You can live that down, can't you?
You can't lose me, Sally--I'm no lily myself!
I'm beginning to think you're a pretty swell guy.
I'll change and be with you in ten minutes.
Make it five.
Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.
I'm going to return the bracelet right now and face the consequences.
Well, I'll be--!!!
Not here--follow me around the shed.
Don't you know better than to talk to me with people around?
Oh, putting on the swell, eh?
I thought you were a smart guy.
If I was smart I wouldn't be working my way over on this ship.
We didn't have enough dough for two tickets, did we?
We coulda got two third-class!
No bank roll there, boy. Lucky I could get you signed on--they picked up that Pittsburgh jeweler--made him talk. The heat's on, Shortie--and those Atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome.
Oh, I'm not squawkin', but I'm not used to working and it's a bad habit to get into.
It'll never hurt you---Got any money?
A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!
No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.
Nix, the law!
He's a colored man in chauffeur's uniform carrying a basket of fruit.
Quick, let me have that money. I'm broke and I'll need it for tips.
You're a wise guy--Gimme back--
You don't think--?
Yer lucky I'm here at all. I tell you, Jimmy--my feet'll never hold out.
Stop squawking! You were doing this job on a ship four years ago when I first picked you up, weren't you?
Yeah--but high livin's made me soft.
How're the tips?
A dollar forty.
I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.
Not a chance.
Come on-- I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.
Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?
Oh, Shortie!-- --there's a girl on this ship--
--there's thousands of 'em!
This is a business trip!
She was wearing a white dress with a cute, black hat-- and carrying a bag with S. M. on it. Funny--her name's not on the passenger list.
Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you ever think of that?
Just a minute, steward--haven't you forgotten something?
No, sir?
My change.
Change?
Shortie!--you know my motto?
Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
Inspector McKinney.
Are you screwy?
I fell in his arms--Couldn't resist it.
Here--drop it where they'll find it and return it to him. He's not a bad egg. I'll ship him back the fifty before we arrive.
You take some awful chances.
They won't squawk--they're professionals.
Well, if that's the case, you're sure of winning the first couple of hands--But what about after that?
Have the purser give you twenty-five hundred dollars for this check--and bring the cash here.
Here's your twenty-five hundred, Mr. Brett.
Thank you. I owe you a dollar forty--here--keep the change.
Thank you, sir.
Sorry to interrupt you, Mr Brett, but I have a message for you.
What is it?
Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
About sixteen hundred.
Partners, ain't we?
You keep it--
<U>Me</U>!
Say--wait a minute!
Hello, Jimmy. What's up?
Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
Why--I--er thought with all this heat turned on I'd hide it.
Where did you hide it?
On the drunk.
Come in!
I'll bet a couple of hundred-- I wonder what's keeping that boy.
Don't worry about that. We'll settle after the hand. Out in Montana where I come from a man's word is all that's necessary. What have you got?
Three Jacks.
It's your deal.
How's your mother feeling?
Well, to tell you the truth, gentlemen, I've sworn off playing poker.
Why, you wouldn't quit when you're ahead, would you?
I thought you were a sucker--
That goes two ways.
I think I've met you before, Mr. Brett.
Oh, yes. On the pier.
Before that. Your face is very familiar.
Yours, too. Are you the McKinney, the dentist on Calumet Avenue in Chicago?
I'm going to the show--
Care to join us?
This is exciting--but if it's been stolen they can't get away with it on a ship--
Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--
It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector--
Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--
If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing-- Bet I could find that bracelet--
I wouldn't worry about it--it'll turn up-- How about a nightcap, Inspector?
No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--
Thought you were going to turn in, Inspector.
How about you?
No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.
You know what I'd do, if I were you--before the card game I'd go to the Purser's office.
Why?
Well, someone else besides myself may have seen you in the vicinity of Mrs. Rosson's cabin this evening--even the stewards in that corridor insisted on being searched. Get me?
Sure, I'll go.
I'll go with you.
It's easy to see the Purser hasn't had much practice.
How about trying your fine Italian hand?
This has nothing to do with me-- But always remember, Purser, when you're searching anybody, take the lining of their coat, like this-- --run your fingers all along these seams.... Then-- back of the collar--<U>here</U>--that used to be a favorite trick--and never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe--like this.
Hey!--you're tickling me.
Hello, young fellow!
Coming to the pool for a swim?
Wouldn't bet against her. Tell you what I will do--bet you I find that bracelet before we hit France. Not a hundred, though--just fifty.
Nice girl, that-- I'd hate to see <U>her</U> get a raw deal. You know, the great trouble with crooks is they're <U>too</U> smart. Now if I'd taken that bracelet, I'd find some way to slip it back--I'd know I could never get ashore with it.
Thought you might need me--don't talk, kid, and don't let him scare you--
Don't get yourself all worked up--
Mmmmmmmmmhm.... Now, Jimmy, what were you doing in that corridor before the shots were fired?
Here's your fifty.
Their faces are familiar--but not to each other.
No--I'll take Sally and give you the best of it.
Tell you what I'll do. I'll toss you for her--heads she plays with me.
That's too bad.
I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
That's all right. I'll attend to this.
Wait a minute--let's match for it.
Oh, Denby--have you seen Sally around?
No--I'm looking for Miss Marsh myself. I thought you might know where she is--
She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.
I don't know what it is, but I won't use it. Is she entertaining you?
I should say not.
I won't--I'll ask for one right now. Sally tells me she's in love with you.
She did?
Yes--but don't ask me why--because I could never tell you. I don't know what most guys want out of life--but <U>that</U> would be enough for me--I wouldn't care about-- easy money--or--showing off my smart brains--I'd just like to live <U>my</U> life so nothing I did would bounce back and ruin <U>hers</U>--Do I make myself clear?
Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.
O.K., kid-- I'm only sorry for one thing.
What's that?
Here you are, sir.
Eighty cents a word--three--six--nine words. That'll be seven twenty, but it's too much--I'll show you how to save some money.
Where do you live?
In New York.
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Sure.
"Will be back in four weeks"-- --that saves you eighty cents right there!
That's right--here's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.
Wait a minute--I think I can cut out a couple o' more words.
How?
"Will--be--back--in--four--weeks." You don't need the "will be." Just say "Back in four weeks."
Wait a minute--I think I can cut something else out. "Back in four weeks." Instead of "in four weeks"--say "next month"--That saves another word.
Just a minute--I don't think we need the word "Back" --Where <U>is</U> "Back"?
Back is in New York.
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Sure.
Now we get it down to two words--"next month."
Send that.
Wait a minute--What <U>is</U> next month?
Next month is June.
Fine! Instead of saying "next month"--we'll use one word and say "June."
June? That's my wife's name.
That's great! There's the address and message all in one word.
O.K.! Send that!
Just a minute--Your wife knows her own name, doesn't she?
Sure.
Well, there's no use in sending it. See that--I saved you seven twenty!
I'll say--how fast is this boat going?
Oh,--we're doing about thirty--
Pretty good--thirty <U>miles</U> an hour--
No. <U>Knots</U>!
What?
Knots!
That's me!
Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
Yes--Me--in person!
I can see where I won't talk much to you.
Hello, Denby!
I thought I put you to bed.
Oh, was that me you put to bed? Thanks. I've been looking all over for you.
Well, did you find me?
Not yet. Say, where is this boat headed for?
This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.
Hey, boy--give this man a cablegram blank. Where is your wife?
Tell her you're on your way to France and will be back in four weeks.
Come on, get up. That horse is carrying too much of a load.
Who won?
Well, you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.
I was never stiffer in my life.
He's funny--maybe you can use him in the show, Mr. Denby.
Oh, there you are--
That's right--you're the one I was looking for. You'll excuse me. How about you and I being alone?
Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?
Let me see now--Don't tell me-- You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.
McKinney's the name.
Here we are, folks--eighty thousand wild-eyed fans go mad--they go mad as Chad Denby--with the arms of iron, and the nerves of steel--picks up his racket-- What is this thing--a racket or a mallet?
Looks to me like standard equipment for the Department of Street Cleaning--
You can always tell how much a man's traveled by the way he plays shuffle-board.
Those kids seem to be getting along fine!--
It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!
Hello, Inspector--I hear your vacation's been spoiled. Somebody lost a bracelet.
Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?
Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?
Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.
Well, I'll tell you--we picked him up about a year ago-- but could never pin anything on him.
Maybe he just travels in bad company.
I didn't--
He asked for a loan of it, didn't he?
Yes--but I didn't give it to him--
Is this your gun?
Well, that's something--even if only the fish can see it.
Are you happy?
Am I a member of this club?
You're the President. Come in! Your brother was just telling me a few jokes I can use on the radio--
Are you paying any attention to his jokes?--the first thing you know, you'll be taking piano lessons from Venus de Milo-- Get out of here.
Everything O.K.?
Looks like your old workshop back on 42nd Street.
Like it?
Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--
Yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see, Sally, I sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company.
And you've put it over--haven't you?
Why not? I give 'em a great show--and you know-- We're doing capacity, Sally--and all <U>Nice</U> people--
You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?
No--not much--excepting--
Still got my picture, I see--I was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?
No--Inexperienced-- A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet.
I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to do this--
Do what--
You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.
News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--
It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was O.K. by me. I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care-- --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running around with a racketeer--
Women have a curious taste for knickknacks. When I found out about Ned--tried to make a break--Lee wouldn't stand for it and--well--here I am!
Stay on the other side of the pond for a couple of months--you'll soon forget all about it.
Chad Denby broadcasting-- --the nicest man I ever knew--
But not nice enough to marry--eh?
Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.
Women are such fools!--Why do so many of us pass up <U>right</U> guys?
You're just a Master of Ceremonies. He might have knocked his head off.
What's the difference? He's got more heads than he needs.
I don't get the humor of that remark.
Yes.
Very serious?
Why--don't you like him?
I'll give you another chance to tell the truth, Lother.
What do you mean?
Why don't you be a good little boy and leave her alone?
Oh--I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.
I just tried to show her the difference between the squirrels and the skunks.
Meaning what?
Yep--everybody's having a good time but me--What do you want, Mary?
I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--
But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?
Somebody's got to do it--
Well, let's hear the poem--
Oh, you dear Atlantic Ocean--how you spread across the sea--From New York to dear old Europe--just for boats to ride on thee--
Very good, Mary--
But I'm not finished yet----And your waves are so colossal--rocking boats both to and fro--Oh-h, Atlantic, how I love you ----how I love you--
What's the matter, Mary?
I'm getting seasick--
H'mm--<U>Dear</U> Atlantic--
Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?
Oh, Mr. Den-n-by!
Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary?
I feel better now--I've got a riddle! When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup?
All right. When <U>is</U> a plate of bean soup not a plate of noodle soup?
When it falls off the table and turns turtle--Cute?
With your dry wit and humor--
Oh yeah?--My personality put this thing over--
Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.
What's he got that I haven't got?
Well, he has a straw hat--
So have I--I can get it right out of my trunk.
--And he has sex appeal.
So what?
Get that out of your trunk.
All right--don't spoil the trip with any of those jokes-- there's a nice bunch of people on this trip--nothing but class--I looked over the passenger list and they're all members of the Who's Who!
Never mind the Who's Who--Before I get on this boat I want to know What's What! How about my raise? All I get out of these ocean trips is dizzy.
Is that one of the Who's Who?
H'mm ... no wonder I have trouble rounding up this show--Don't you know there's a rehearsal going on?-- And you wanted a raise.--Come on--get going or you'll get it!
Oh, Chad--what about the rest of the show?
Oh, Mr. Denby, I wrote a poem about a bracelet--
Then, after the first number, I tell the one about the Scotchman trying to open a Pullman window--the Scotchman says to the window--"Gee you're tight."-- and the window says--"You loosen up a bit and so will I."--Good?--And then I do the one-- Oh--you don't like it, eh?
Chad--Lother's on the boat, and I'm worried sick about Sally--
Oh!--So that's it. Does she know he's on board?
What happened to you?
You've got a gun, haven't you, Chad? Will you let me have it?
What for?
Don't ask any questions--just give it to me.
You're wasting your time--she's a friend of mine.
Eh?... Oh.
He works the boats as a "come-on" man. We ought to make a fair combination and do a little business. Jack's a pretty good dealer himself.
That's him! That's the sucker!!
Can you read 'em Jack?
They're a cinch to read--Queen of Clubs-- --Ace of Diamonds.
The man that marks them is an artist--two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks--and they're worth it.
The country boy's about due.
Out my way in Montana we always call a bluff.
How much did you lose?
About twelve hundred.
I went for four.
All right--but what is there to face? It's finished.
You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.
I didn't want to see you again--that's my privilege.
It wasn't smart. Even if you'd gotten away without me --I'd have found you--no matter where you were.
Why don't you leave me alone?
Because I want you--will always want you--no other woman'll ever take your place. I want you more now than I did that first night-- You've forgotten all that, I suppose?
I wish I could.
You get wise to <U>yourself</U>! If you know what's good for you, you'll leave me alone. Everybody's entitled to one mistake--Well--you're mine. When the going got too rough, I pulled up stakes and quit. We stay quit!--Get that!--And what're you going to do about it?
That's more like the old Sally--a little bit of fire. How about Ned?
He's all right.
Thanks to me.
You leave the kid alone.
A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and--
--you'd go with him!
Not because of Ned.
Of course not-- --but isn't it a coincidence that he's from the eighteenth precinct--where they made the squawk?
I'm crazy about the kid and I got him into it. What do you want me to do?
Just smile again and be reasonable. I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.
--and you swear when you get to the other side, you'll never come near either of us again?
Don't, Lee--that's dead.
Go ahead--you didn't used to be so fussy--
I've lost my taste for knickknacks--
Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?
Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
I know he is. You change those clothes and then come to my cabin. I'll expect you around twelve o'clock.
Yes, Yes!
You didn't have a gun in your hand last night?
No!
S'pose you've never thought of killing him--
I wouldn't say that-- I'm glad he's dead--yes--I'd thought of killing him-- but I didn't--
Why?
I tried to borrow a gun from Chad, but--
It's getting kind of chilly on deck. If you'll excuse me, I think I'll go to bed. Good night, Mr. McKinney!
Congratulations.
Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?
He'll be back. What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?
Say, "Thanks very much!"
I mean if you knew it were stolen.
Well, of course, I wouldn't take it.
And if you liked the person, you'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight, wouldn't you?
Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.
That's the truth--every single word!
I sincerely hope so--
Why should <U>I</U> kill him?
Soon as I get that bracelet back I'm going to relax. Wish the guy that borrowed it would help me out--I got to win that fifty bucks.
I've got a hunch you're going to win that bet, Inspector.
Next time I get a vacation I'll spend it at headquarters. Good-night.
There you are, sir.
Thank you.
He's certainly good-natured.
"Smooth's" the word.
I mean--a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that.
Well, I'll be a son of a sea cook!
What's the matter?
I thought I had our sailing covered up-- --and here it is.
Isn't it great to be away from it all? Aren't you happy? It seems too good to be true.
Sure, Sis.
I'm all right.
You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?
I was in his cabin--
What!--are you crazy?
I'll explain later--
Everything in order, sir? What are <U>you</U> doing here, my lad?
Telegrams.
Nothin'.
Let me look at it.
Ain't got time.
I tell yuh I ain't got no bracelet--
I saw him take the bracelet out of that shoe.
Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.
Then why did you run away?
I said that's 500 to you, Holliday. In or out?
Oh, for Christ's sake!
God damn son of a...
Isn't that a daisy?
Just pick up your money and go. Sick of listening to you simper.
Skinny lunger, your guns don't Impress me. Wasn't for those guns You'd be nothin'.
Oh, my God...
Newcomers, eh? Names John Behan, I'm Cochise County Sheriff. Just Hit town?
Just this minute. I'm Wyatt Earp, These're my brothers-
Wyatt Earp...Dodge City, right?
Gave all that up. Going into business.
So how's Tombstone treating you?
Fine, fine. But I was thinkin', You know what this town really Needs is a race track.
What d'you think of the singer?
Nice voice.
The man dealing faro. Who is he?
That's Wyatt Earp. Made quite a Name for himself as a peace Officer in Kansas.
A peace officer... Impressive man
Yes, very. And very married.
Well I guess you can see, never a Dull moment. Maybe you should Stay around to see what happens Next. Who know? You might find a Future here.
I saw that look on your face just now. What's between you and Wyatt?
Listen, I want to talk to you.
Not now. I don't have time.
I saw that look pass between you And Wyatt at the fight. Listen to Me! You're mine! Understand? You're my woman and I'm your man.
My man? You told Wyatt you'd Disarmed those men. Do you Actually believe after that I Could see you as my man? You're Just a dirty little fixer.
Easy. I just wanted to tell you Things're about to start changing Around here. Lots of so-called Hard cases and tough-nuts swagger Around this town but none of 'em's got a clue about the real play. None of 'em.
I don't understand.
He said to turn loose of him.
Where'd you get that horse?
Beauty, ain't he?
I asked where you got him.
Look, I don't want any trouble With you but that's my horse and I mean to have him back. One way Or another.
Come and get him.
What'd the Messican mean, a sick Horse's gonna get us? Didn't make No sense.
He was quoting the bible, Revelations: "Behold a pale horse And the one that sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him."
Shut up, Ike.
I want them spitting blood!
There's no God, there's no devil, I hate the God damn world! I want To die!
Hey, you smell that? Smells like Something died.
I'm retired.
Come on, you...
Feel bad about ol' Fred. Just Can't hold back when I'm feelin' Woolly. Still, feel kinda bad. But now we're square. Anyway no Use for holdin' a grudge. I Deserved a rap in the head.
Make you a deal. My brother took Over the Marshal's office in Tombstone. Got it in his head He's gonna make the place safe For widows and orphans. You and Your boys stay out of his way, I'll make sure he stays out of yours.
Fair enough. You know I got to Admit, you got a lot of bark on You comin' up here like this.
They were all gonna jump me back There. What ever happened to one Against one?
Ain't our way. We go all on one, One on all. Fight one of us, you Fight us all. That's the Cowboy way.
And how come you call yourselves Cowboys? Cowhands ride for the brand.
Oh, we ride for a brand all right. This brand. How 'bout you?
This brand.
I'm sorry. If there was any other-
I want you to know it's over. We're leaving and we're not Coming back.

I see, off to strike it rich, Huh. All right, fine, wish you Luck. Tell you this though, never Was a rich man yet didn't wind up With a guilty conscience.
That's the rumor.
You retired, too?
Not me. I'm in my prime.
Yeah, you look it.
Age quod agis.
Credat Judaeus Apella.
Ecentus stultorum magister.
That's just my game.
On three? You call it.
Why Johnny Ringo, you look like Somebody just walked over your grave. Oh, I wasn't quite as sick as I Made out.
My fight's not with you, Holliday.
I beg to differ. We started a Fight we never got to finish. Play for blood, remember?
All right, lunger. Let's do it.
Here, Doc.
I calculate that's the end of This town. And let's don't bother About the luggage, darling.
You don't even know him.
That's my lovin' man. Just can't Get enough.
What's wrong, Doc?
How you feeling, Doc?
Better.
We must talk, darling. It appears We have to... redefine the nature Of our association.
What's that mean, Doc? You know I Don't understand when you talk up High like that. You mean you Don't want to be my lovin' man no more?
Not exactly...
I'm a good woman to you, Doc. Don't I always take care of you? Nobody cares for you like me. I'm A good woman.
Doc! How the hell are you?
Since when is faro a business?
Didn't you always say gambling's An honest trade?
I said poker's an honest trade. Only suckers buck the tiger. The Odds are all with the house.
Depends how you look at it. I Mean it's not like anybody's Holding a gun to their heads.
Sheriff Behan, Doc Holliday.
Very cosmopolitan.
Very instructive
So now we're in the mining Business. Turning into regular Tycoons. Gonna call this one the Mattie Blaylock. Mattie'll get a Kick out of that, it's her maiden Name.
So tell me, Wyatt. I'm curious. Do you actually consider youself A married man? Forsaking all Others?
Well yeah. Pretty much. I mean I Was no angel when we met but People change Doc. I mean sooner Or later you gotta grow up.
I see. And what would you do if "she" walked in her right now? WYATT "She"?
You know damn well who I mean. That dusky-hued lady Satan.
I don't know. Probably ignore her.
Ignore her?
I'd ignore her. People can Change, Doc.
Satisfied?
He's drunk.
Maybe I ought to go out there.
Wyatt! Just in time. Pull up a chair.
Been hittin' it awful hard, Doc.
Nonsense, I have not yet begun to Defile myself.
But Doc-
I won't be pawed at, thank you Very much
It appears he missed an excellent Chance to keep his mouth shut.
Wyatt, my God! You're shot to pieces!
I'm a man without fear, Wyatt. I Literally don't care if I live or Die. But even I can't fight human Instinct. Somebody suddenly Starts shooting at me, I duck. But you... what on earth were You thinking about?
Doc...
What makes a man like Ringo, Doc? What makes him do the things he does?
A man like Ringo's got a great Empty hole right through the Middle of him and no matter what He does he can't ever fill it. He Can't kill enough or steal enough Or inflict enough pain to ever Fill it. And it drives him mad. Sick mad. Cold and dirty.
So what does he want?
What does he want? He wants revenge.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Wyatt. God, I'm so sorry.
That's all right, Doc. Don't worry.
Well hell, Wyatt. Wyatt, I want You to meet Father Feeney. Father Feeney's just been initiating me Into the mysteries of the great And ancient Church of Rome. You See, it appears my hypocrisy Knows no bounds.
How you feelin', Doc?
Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree? A better one might be how Do you feel?
Hurts. Hurts pretty bad.
I imagine it would, yes. So now We can add self-pity to your list Of frailties.
All right, Doc...
You think I'm kidding. You're the Most fallible, wrong-headed, self- Deluding, just generally Benighted jackass I've ever Known. Yet, withal, even at your Worst, you're the only human Being in my entire life who ever Gave me hope.
All I ever wanted was to live a Normal life.
When will you wake up? You Wouldn't know a normal life if it Bit you in the ass.
That's great coming from you.
I played the cards I was dealt, Wyatt. Your problem is you're Always trying to play someone Else's. Allow me to tell you the Truth and thus set you free: There is no happiness, Wyatt There is no normal life. There's Only life, that's all. Just life. The rest is relative.
Then what do I do?
First you can grab that black- Haired woman and make her your own.
All right. Then what?
Hey, is that "Old Dog Tray"? Sounds like "Old Dog Tray".
What?
You know, Stephen Foster. "Oh, Susanna". "Camptown Races", Stephen-stinkin'-Foster!
I see, well this happens to be a Nocturne.
A which?
Drunks. Crawfished a bet, called Him a liar. I saw the whole thing.
Don't touch me!
You really look awful.
Not half as bad as I feel.
Then why in hell're you doin' This? You ought to be in bed.
Wyatt Earp is my friend.
Hell, I got lot's of friends.
I don't believe it. He's clean!
What? But I saw 'em-
All right, I'm on fire! Black Seven, seven stickin' spades. Let's go!
I'm your man... You win again. Well played, sir. You are on fire.
Told you. I'm red hot, I'm Blazin'! Now, red seven. Seven Stinkin' diamonds. Look out! Five Thousand! Let's go!
Awful lot of money.
Can't take the heat, get outta The kitchen.
You're the doctor. sad news, friend.
Hello, Wyatt! Hiya Doc!
Are you out of your mind? What on Earth'd make us-
Maybe you ought to have a talk With Doc, Wyatt. I don't know if He's gonna make it.
No.
What?
See how she breezed out of here. Like she had wings. Funny thing But I can't really remember how She looked. I can remember parts Of her clear as crystal, her Mouth, her walk, how she shut her Eyes when she laughed, little Bits and pieces, but not the Whole package. Can't put it Together for some reason.
Good God, you're really-
You tell Ringo... just tell him I'll be there.
Wyatt, are you crazy?
But I'd do it, I'd get that one Into him. So help me God, I would.
Wyatt, I... I ain't got the words.
All right, what's it to be? New Mexico's that way.
Colorado's closer
There they go. Look kinda like preachers.
You know, we might just pull this off.
Yeah, better run, you bastards!
Hey Creek, you ever see anything Like that before?
Wyatt, listen, you can't beat Him. You're good and God knows You got the courage, but you Ain't in Ringo's class. Hell, He's the best that's ever been. 'Cept maybe for Wild Bill.
Praise Jesus!
We're the law, ain't we? Well the Law don't ride around vermin-
We've never actually met. My Name's-
Wyatt Earp, I know. I was Beginning to think we'd never Meet. This is fortuitous. That Means lucky.
What is it?
Easy now... That mare's in season.
Oh... Now she's starting. How do they know?
They know. It's the scent. We Better split 'em up.
That was lovely!
You know you almost got us both Killed back there?
Fun though, wasn't it?
You'd die for fun?
Wouldn't you? You're laughing! I Was sure you never laughed.
I laugh sometimes
Yes, but how often? Tell me, are You happy?
Am I happy? I don't know. Happy As the next man, I guess. I don't Laugh all day long like an idiot, If that's what you mean.
You're a little touchy about it.
I'm not touchy, I just, it's a Silly question, that's all. Am I Happy? Are you happy?
Of course, I'm always happy. Unless I'm bored. That blonde Woman, is that your wife?
What about her?
Nothing... Tell me, what do you Want out of life?
Where do you get these questions?
Just answer.
I don't know, make some money, Have some kids, you know.
Doesn't suit you.
How would you know?
Just doesn't, that's all.
Well I ought to know my own mind And I'm tellin' you what suits me Is a family and kids. That suits Me right down to the ground. In Fact, that's my idea of heaven. All right, what's your idea of heaven?
See? You're laughing again. But That's what I want. Go places and Move and never look back and just Have fun. Forever. That's my idea Of heaven. Need someone to share It with, though.
You mean Behan? Then why are you with him?
Well he's handsome and he's Charming. He's all right. For Now. Don't say it, I know, I'm Rotten. I can't help it. I've Tried to be good but it's too Boring.
The way you talk. Never heard a Woman talk like that.
Oh look, I haven't got time to be Proper, I want to live. I'm a woman, I like men. If that's Unladylike then I guess I'm not a Lady. At least I'm honest.
What's wrong?
I don't know, doesn't make any Sense. I almost can't look at You. Like it hurts.
You know this is adultery. You Burn in hell for that.
I must say this certainly has Been an unexpected little Windfall.
And I don't even know your full name.
Easy to fix. Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp.
And I'm Josephine Sarah Marcus. My friends call me Josie.
Josie... No, I'm gonna call you Sadie.
I hate Sadie.
Well you'll always be Sadie to me.
Always?
So I assume we're regarding this As just a kind of interlude.
Look, it's too much of a tangle. I already cast my lot. I can't go Back and I can't sneak, feel back Enough as it is.
You feel bad about this? About me?
I didn't mean it that way.
You know you don't have to sneak. You could stay with me. I know Things, Wyatt. Sweet things. I Could make you so happy.
No, no, get away, get away from me...
Sorry about your friend. And I'm sorry about...
I forgave you the moment you said it.
I have to go.
Wyatt! My God...
I have nothing left. I have Nothing to give you. I have no Pride, no dignity, no money. I Don't even know how we'll make a Living. But I promise I'll love You every second of your life.
What can I get you?
Let me have one of those cigars. Kinda nice in here. You run it?
Milt Joyce, owner-operator.
You see that bird at the faro Table? That's Johnny Tyler. He Barged in here one day, said he Was takin' over the game, started Slappin' customer, wavin' his Gun around, scarin' off all the High-class play. Only trade comes In here now's just bummers and Drovers, just the dregs.
Why don't you get rid of him and Get yourself straight dealer?
Those Cowboys're tellin' Everybody in town they're gonna Clean you out. They're down in That lot right now behind the OK Corral.
Wyatt, I couldn't find a single Store that had laudanum any-
Come up to the fire, honey.
Long as I live I'll never Get used to that sound.
They're just lonely is all. Hell, I howl myself sometimes.
No, stay. Please stay with me.
Honey, I gotta start makin' money.
Oh, all right.
Well I guess I don't have to go Right now. I guess I could stay a little while.
No, no, I don't want to keep you.
No really, I can stay a while.
Just go. It's all right. Wyatt, Really. Work well.
That the bottle Lou gave you? Better go easy on that stuff.
I know what I'm doing. Where have You been?
Out ridin'. So... how you doin'?
I don't know. I'm all right.
Really? You sure?
Well, I was thinking, we've Already made a pile of money. Maybe we should just pull up Stakes and move on. And we could Stay on the move, you know? Just Keep going, see the world. Live On room service the rest of our Lives. How'd that be?
Wyatt, what're you talkin' about?
Thought you swore you'd never Carry that thing again.
Mattie. What about this?
I need it.
'Least you admit it.
Admit what, I'm an opium fiend? No, Wyatt, I just said I need it. I need something to keep me warm At night.
Look, Mattie, I know you're-
All right, look. I can make it Right, I can make this up to you, Mattie. I can, I swear.
Well hello, Sherm.
You wanted to talk?
Yeah, kinda, wanted to see if you'd join back up with us.
That what you got me up here for?
You're a Cowboy, you're a Brother. Come back, no hard Feelings.
Forget it, Ringo.
Isn't there anything I can say That'll change your mind? You're Gonna stay with your new friends?
'Least they don't scare women.
Run for your lives, boys! It's That great two-gun dog-catcher From Kansas!
McMasters, isn't it? Listen, you Seen a black stallion with-
Look, I got a rule. I don't talk To lawmen. Dog-catchers neither.
I'm not a lawman, I'm just a Private citizen getting' my Property back
So what about you Cowboys anyway?
If I had to explain it you Wouldn't understand. Just say We're brothers to the bone.
Yeah, but some of the things they Say your brothers've done...
No, wait. Please. I know nothin' I say'll fix things but I want You to know it wasn't me.
No? Brothers to the bone, right?
I ain't your brother, I ain't None of your damn brothers. Move!
Florentino! He's getting away!
I know that cut. You mean there's A waterhole near there?
But this time they'll be ready.
What'd you do that for?
Next waterhole's Black Draw. We Could be there by mid-morning.
There they are. No herd though.
I don't like it.
Well how do we look?
Give him some good exercise? Sure Some stud. Some string in fact. What're you gonna do, race 'em?
Boy, look at all those stars. Bet You can see every star there is. Practical touch 'em. Kinda makes You think, you know? I mean you Look up and you think God made All that but he still remembered To make a little speck like me. Kinda flattering really. Hey, Wyatt, you believe in God? No, Come on, really, do you?
Maybe, yeah. Hell, I don't know.
Well what do you think happens When you die?
Got me. Somethin'. Nothin'. I Don't know.
Really? What about hell? They got A sign or what?
Wyatt, meet Fred White, he's town marshal.
It's that woman from the coach!
Hey Doc! Come on now.
Listen to me, both of you. This Is no good. This is trouble we Don't need. For the first time in Our lives we got a chance to stop Wandering and finally be a Family. Do this and you throw it All away. You saw what happened To Fred White.
Come on, we're not about pickin' Fights. Just gonna keep a little Order, that's all.
Yeah?
Like you said, just gotta know How to handle 'em. Old Fred Wasn't up to it. We know that We're doin', Wyatt.
All right, say you're right, say You don't get yourself killed. There's something else. It's too late for Virge, he Already rolled his bone. But it's Not too late for you, Morg.
Doc won't quit, been up 36 hours. Clanton came in an hour ago, they Switched over to poker. Tried to Get him to bed but he just won't Let go.
How you doin', boy?
You were right. It's nothin' like I thought. I almost wish...
Dropped him, that was it. Sorry If I made a worse mess for you.
That thunder's sure somethin'.
Get down, boy.
Morgan, are you crazy? They're Out gunning for us! What the Hell're you doin'?
What's it look like? They want a Piece of me they can come and get It, I'm not crawlin' into my hole.
Morg, use your head.
I am usin' it, Wyatt. Been Wonderin' how the hell we got in This tangle. You know they hit Clum's house, too? Shot up his wife. His wife. Who ever heard of That? Men sneakin' around in the Dark, back-shootin', scarin' Women? They're bugs, Wyatt. You Know all your smart talk about Live and let live? Ain't no live And let live with bugs.
I know, I was wrong. But Morg, Look, we got to get out.
I just got it fixed.
You were right, Wyatt. They got Me good. Don't let 'em get you Too.
Will somebody get the damn dog out-
Remember about the light you're Supposed to see when you're dyin'?
Easy Morg, don't think about that now.
You back that Queen again, you Son of a bitch, I'll blow you Right out of that chair! Somethin' on your mind?
Just wanted to let you know You're sitting in my chair.
That a fact?
For a man that don't go heeled You run your mouth kinda reckless.
Don't need to go heeled to get The bulge on a dub like you.
That a fact?
Yeah. It's a fact.
Go ahead. Skin it. Skin that Smoke wagon and see what happens.
Easy, gents. Private affair... Wyatt! Doc! Hey!
Way ahead of you, Wyatt. You want Us to help you get Ike Clanton And Johnny Behan. Everybody knows They're the ones to blame for Your brothers.
Got a sheaf of federal warrants. Being in the Territories it's up To our discretion how they're Served. That means we got the Cowboys without quarter. The Black flag, brother. No Prisoners, no mercy, amen.
Talked it over. We decided we Don't need the money. Took out 13 Dollars each, though. Federal Posseman's fee. That all right?
We should get moving.
Allie-girl...And Louisa! You're So lovely. I'm at your feet, Darlin'. Just at your feet. Guess it's only right. Ma always Said you were the prettiest.
Look at that. Busted. Brand new Money Ward, too. 33 years old And I don't even have a decent Watch. 'Bout time I started Lookin' out for myself.
Well here we are a family again. Been so long plain forgot how Good it feels. Want to thank you For that, Wyatt. All your doin'.
Well that's your problem. Hey Virge, see anything of Doc while You were in Prescott?
Look pretty rough.
Well we're off and running. Just Acquired us a quarter-interest in The game at the Oriental.
Acquired?
Her maiden name was Sullivan.
Keep your eye on that brass ring. Don't let anything side-track you.
You know, I was thinkin', maybe We ought to open our own place. That's the real money. Build it Up, milk it for all it's worth, Then sell it off for a bundle and Breeze out of this burg with more Money than Croesus and ready to Live like kings. Let's you and me Take a walk around town, Virge, See if we can
I can't hardly believe it. It's Working out just like you said, Wyatt. We're lootin' this burg Six ways through Sunday.
Pretty fun too, isn't it?
I couldn't help it, Wyatt. I Looked at that woman and it was Just like somebody slapping me in The face. I mean these people're Afraid to even walk down the Street and I'm trying to make Money off it like some kind of God damn vulture. That's not me, That's somebody I don't even know.
Virgil, please. Don't do this to me.
It's got nothin' to do with you, Wyatt. It's-
Maybe I jumped the gun. Maybe Those Cowboys aren't near as bad As they're painted. You know I Was thinkin', there's a lot of Money in the cattle business...
Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys?
Business is business. Don't have To love 'em to work with 'em. Not If there's money in it.
Billy Clanton, Wes Fuller, and Billy Claiborne. Now there's six Of 'em. This is like a bad dream.
Here they are again. Look at 'em.
Wait till the liquor wears off. Once they start getting headaches They'll lose interest.
Wyatt, they're threatening our lives.
You'll never make that stick.
They're carrying guns in town.
Virge, that's a misdemeanor. You Go down there to arrest 'em, Something goes wrong, maybe this Time somebody gets his head Broke, suddenly it's a mess and It won't end there, you'll have Cowboys comin' around lookin' for Trouble from here to Christmas. You gonna risk all that over a Misdemeanor?
No, damn it, it's wrong, they're Breakin' the law.
Virge, you're makin' the arrest. You make contact, I'll back you Up. Morgan'll back me up, Doc'll Keep an eye out for trouble. And Keep your hands on your guns. They even look like they're gonna Start something, buffalo 'em. Right over the head.
Wyatt, I know what I'm doin'.
Getting late. Guess I'll turn in.
Virgil?
What about all these saloons?
See what I mean about it getting Spooky?
Curly Bill, huh? Who was that Other idiot?
Ike Clanton, Old Man's eldest Son. Know he ain't got the stuff, Makes him miserable.
Why don't you just leave it alone?
No, I gotta do something. I don't Suppose you'd card-
... What were you saying, Admiral? Something about this 'not being a job for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing playboy spy?'
- I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.
But -
I appreciate your assistance, M. But this is now a military operation.
It's too late -
Good evening. I've just spoken with the Prime Minister at the economic summit in Tokyo; he's expecting a full update within the hour. For those of you still unaware, some forty minutes ago -
Excuse me, but - I must formally protest this meeting. Given the nature of what's occurred - and the need for secrecy - I see no reason to involve the air force, the army, or MI-6. This is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her Majesty's Royal Navy.
Why wasn't the ship protected?!?! Why was it sailing without radar?
I resent your tone, sir. I have men who are missing -
At least we know where the gold is. When are the recovery ships due?
36 hours. They've already sailed from the Persian gulf.
Always nice to meet one of her Majesty's fellow subjects... Especially one with such distinguished friends.
It's a beautiful boat, Sir Elliot. Practically glows in the dark.
I hope you've enjoyed this little charade.
Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours?
A piece of advice, Mr. Bond: Don't screw with a man who buys ink by the ton. It's deadlier than uranium.
How did you get this number?
Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information. Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes?
Mr. Bond! Nice to see you.
Sir Elliot.
Before I became involved with Paris, she was always involved with the most inappropriate' men... Playboys. Thrill seekers. Middle aged Peter Pans who only brought out the worst in her.
I see.
I tried to save her. But she remained a manic depressive: Fits, inappropriate behavior... Delusions of grandeur.
I wonder if it runs in the family.
Still, I do miss her. I only wish she could have lived to see all this.
By the way - what is it that brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mister Bond?
I call this the Rogue's gallery.
Yes. I can see: You've hung the rest of your relatives.
My third great Uncle - the Earl of Aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of Hong Kong from the Chinese. His son-in-law - George Harmsway - made the first family fortune, running opium into Shanghai... His son, Thomas, who lost it, smoking the opium... And my grandfather Henry, who opened the first telegraph station, and published the colony's first English newspaper. It was a city
So why did you leave?
Welcome to the new world order, Mr. Bond. Churchill had his armies; Caesar had his legions; I have my divisions: News, sports, business, entertainment. And these are my foot soldiers: 2000 people working on 14 floors to feed 300 newspapers, 4 cable news networks, 87 magazines, and 29 different cable TV channels - in 35 languages.
...Although it must be fun to have all those satellites.
They're merely tools to disseminate information.
Or disinformation... If you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? Maybe one degree a minute?
You see, Mr. Bond, you and I are both men of action. But your era is passing. Words are the new weapons; satellites the new artillery. And make no mistake about it: In the right hands, they can be as deadly as your Walther PPK.
...Words to live by?
Briefly.
...And what's that, my dear?
I'm sure they will.
Are your guards really going to kill a helpless girl?
...So that's what the weapons grade uranium was for.
Precisely, Mr. Bond. In a matter of minutes, the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor... And when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium -
- Instant melt-down.
...As the advertising says: Tomorrow never lies.
I'd rather die alone.
In the Strait of Malacca, when a boat is even five minutes late, one begins to worry, Mr. Bond.
I know. Pirates from Sumatra want the cargo; smugglers from Thailand and Burma want the ships.
Sometimes kill the crew; other times - Torture them.
I'm sorry.
The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night. Captain blamed the auto-pilot; I suspected he was drunk - until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem.
Did you test the auto-pilots? The satellite positioning receiver?
Next morning. Both boats. Nothing wrong. My 90 year old grandfather thinks 'Ghost in the computer - Silicon Dragon.'
I appreciate your time -
Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch. Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody knows more about the Strait.
Where can I find him?
I'm sure she is, James. But I'm afraid you'll have to 'kiss off' the rest of your lessons this afternoon.
Moneypenny... Here I was, finally getting a feel for a new tongue -
4:30. It may take me a little longer to wrap things up here.
Four o'clock. Don't be late.
Tsi tien, Chien-penny.
Moneypenny! We've got to stop meeting like this. They may be on to us.
Hello, James. Enjoy your meeting?
By the way, James: Ordinarily I would never ask, but... Weren't you and that Colonel once stranded on a raft for two weeks in the Sargasso Sea?
Actually, I've never known you to do either... But -
- We all want what we can't have?
What - no lust for adventure?
Q! How are you?
Retired. I'm not getting paid to help you save the world anymore.
I'm sorry. It was a national emergency -
That hardly makes up for the imposition. Now, for what I hope will be the very last time - pay attention, 007. First, computer generated retrograde analysis map. Body here, meteorolog- ical influences here, likely vector- ing of the ship's coordinates here.
Do you have any idea of what any of that means? In English?
Not a clue. I didn't lose the ship. Next, your new personal communicator. Picture-phone, fax, beeper.
Do I have to dial '9' to get out?
Your new car.
- Four wheel drive?
Yes. And do try to keep all four of them on the road. All the usual refinements: Smoke, missiles, machine guns - Fully operational remote control. Drives forward, reverse - Stop that! Plus infrared thermal imaging radar, heads up instrumentation, and 17 beverage cup holders.
... 17 Beverage cup holders?
I must say, Q, you seem to be doing rather well in your retirement.
Yes -
Wait a minute -
Don't you think you're overreacting?
Yes. The famous James Bond. I've heard all about you, sir. You were under direct orders to act as an observer - and yet you had to go off, on your own, like some half-assed CIA cowboy - Endangering the gold, attracting that lunatic woman, and then putting in a distress call for us to save your bloody hide.
...That's all well and good, Captain, save for one thing: There's no gold down there.
What are you talking about? We went through all this and the ship isn't even down there?
Yes, the ship is down there. But the gold is gone.
That's absurd! It took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold.
Paris?!? What are you doing here?
Is that any way to say hello?
Oh, James. I've missed you -
Is this another one of your games?
Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?
Don't you even miss me? Didn't I mean anything to you?
What about Elliot Harmsway? Or is this just another one of your stunts?
Do you feel better now?
What about the uranium?
I'm so sorry, James. I promise, I'll never leave you again.
Shhhhh...
Paris -
Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
Just - say it. Say it just once.
His newspapers?
More scurrilous, unsubstantiated gossip.
Perhaps. But it does explain how an ex-KGB agent turned illegal-arms dealer is suddenly portrayed as a long-time friend of the people. If you believe what you read in the papers.
There is one last thing, 007: Elliot Harmsway is vital to the economic interests of this nation. He's also a major contributor to the party. I expect him to be given every consideration.
Political considerations?
Okay, Saunders. What is it this time? Rocket in the leg? Machine pistol in the arm?
Q's retirement party. I'd just put the knife into the cake, and -
It must do something.
Now pay attention, 007. We haven't much time to demonstrate your new Q toys.
How is old Q?
Gone fishing.
Fishing?
Saunders, I've lit cigarettes -
... Shoelaces?
Plastique explosive shoelaces. Cut them to regulate the size of the blast; totally harmless until you attach the detonator hidden in the heel of your shoe.
Perfect way to tie up a... 'Knotty' problem?
Moving along - A typical plastic security card. Name here, magnetic information stripe here - And a code breaking microprocessor here. Swipe it through any card reader - anywhere - you're in.
It was an authorized test. I returned the money.
I see...
Finally, your new watch: Blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks; press this button, the sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter.
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime?
A wedding band??? What am I supposed to be able to do with this?
Wade, what the hell are you doing here?
I am not here, ol' buddy. The CIA has absolutely no knowledge of the missing ship, the missing gold, where it was going, or when it left Hong Kong.
That's reassuring.
Hey - the world is my office.
I don't know if you'd call it a boat...
Something with an engine? Not oars?
What do you want with the Harbor Master?
Tide and current charts. Work backward from the body - find where the ship sank. Where did you get the boat?
I think I've just seen my next future ex-wife.
Natalya?
Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
She married a hockey player.
I envy your 'undercover' assignments.
I have to get these to London. Do you know this Captain Cheong?
Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur yacht club.
Can you arrange a meeting?
Yo! Jimbo! I won five hundred - What happened?
I dunno, Jimbo. It can't be out here. How could they get this far off course?
Who knows? Fog, night...
They'd never sail this close to the shore.
I got you covered.
Sidney Winch, meet -
Where to now, Jimbo?
Interesting presentation.
Interesting video tape.
They point, I shoot.
Do you have a pen? I just got promoted and don't have my new cards yet.
... Does this do anything?
Married?
Happily.
... Kids?
Three. You? Married?
No.
Here. I gave you my assistant's phone number. If it's urgent, she knows where to reach me.
Thanks. Take care -
Bourbon. Neat.
Sometimes, you just have to plunge into things. Be reckless.
- And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.
Have we met?
This afternoon. Our boats practically kissed in the harbor. James Bond.
Vodka martini, shaken not stirred. And another for you?
Boyfriend?
Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
Pity. Bring him whatever he wants.
Actually, I'm here on business. You might say it was a... Golden opportunity.
And exactly what business are you in, Mr. Bond?
Insurance. Lloyds of London.
The Strait can be a very dangerous place, Mr. Bond. A few words scribbled on a piece of paper in London doesn't carry a lot of value out here. Including life insurance.
I'll keep that in mind.
I see my date is here. And I think Mr. Bond is ready to leave.
Nice to run into you again.
- Shut up!
You have to excuse Miss Winch: She thinks she's on a 'seduce and destroy' mission through life... ...But she won't kill us.
No?
No. First, because I don't think it's in your nature. And second, because there's no gold down there.
Do I have to do everything around here?
I hope you'll be gentle.
And what do you call this?
If I were you -
- You're not.
Just remember: They think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there.
Why don't we just take these -
... Do you have a gun?
What?
You heard me. A gun? I left mine in the car.
That's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.
Harmsway sank that ship and stole the gold. It's on the Sea Dolphin II. And thanks to your little show and tell - - giving him the evidence - We're the only ones who can tie him to the crime.
Elliot Harmsway is my Uncle!
Blood or Dutch?
He was my father's best friend!
He's killed closer.
You are seriously deranged.
This has got to be a mistake.
Wait here.
... How did you get into marine salvage?
Not a lot of difference.
What the hell does that do?
Down?
What now? And don't give me some movie cliché like 'trust me.'
Put your back to the railing. Sit up on it.
Are you listening to me?
Put your arms around my neck. Lock your legs around my waist.
Sometimes you just have to -
Is this - like - a normal day for you?
Here. You shoot. I'll drive.
...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship.
Another reason??? Did I miss something???
If it's radio controlled, it'll break the code.
If not?
Sleep well?
What do you mean, you'd rather die alone?
... Yes???
Before we go any further here, Mr. Bond, from Lloyds of London, I just want to get two things straight.
... Yes?
First, that boat is in international waters. I'm claiming it for salvage. One-third of that gold is mine.
And number two?
If you think we're going to have some kind of 'life affirming' romance here just because we cheated death, let me be clear: We're going to have it where I want, and when I want.
And when might that be?
Thank you Colonel Everhart. 007, I'd like to see you in my office. Why don't you and the Colonel exchange numbers if you need more information?
Come in, 007. You know the Minister?
Tell me, 007, what do you know about Elliot Harmsway?
- Along with Tomorrow - the first world-wide newspaper. Circulation 27 million. Daily. -
... What's Harmsway done?
The reason I invited the Minister here, 007, was to reassure him that this investigation will be handled with the utmost discretion.
Of course.
Which is also why I've withheld this information from NATO and our allies.
... Didn't we once investigate Harmsway?
You're to wear this mask at the Venice Carnival, and wait to be contacted.
.... I hate to ask, but... Did you ever think you'd miss Communism?
But if Elliot Harmsway is involved with that uranium, I want him prosecuted to the ends of the earth.
...I'll give you a ring from Venice.
Sorry I'm late -
...You're turning into quite the politician, 007.
I have an excellent teacher. 'Make sure you wear the uniform'?
What do you make of all this?
The infrared satellite images. No heat, no flame, no explosion. If that boat went down where they said it did, there should have been some residual heat reading on the surface.
Sabotage?
... And what do you call these?
Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.
And what do you call these? The Gang of Two?
Stop it!
I was just getting to the interesting part!
We've already done the interesting part. Do you forget?
Sakwa!
Is that Mandarin, or Cantonese?
Tsi tien, Mr. Bond.
Who's in charge here?
I am. What do you want?
You have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way.
Forget it. No way. I got here first.
What's your name?
My name is Sidney Winch, and -
Good for you, Miss Winch. You now have exactly 30 seconds to get this rust bucket out of here.
I know my rights. These are international waters. The British Navy abandoned that boat, and I'm claiming it. Under international law, I have the right to salvage what's on that wreck.
Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney.
I was an attorney!
Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above that profession. Ten seconds. Are you leaving?
No.
You won't get away with this!
The Canadian Prime Minister wants to set a lunch -
Pencil it in for the next trip -
The American presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story -
Send him a $10,000 campaign contribution, and explain I have no control over what my journalists write -
Your bankers want an answer about the Brazilian TV stations
No -
The Queen invited you to dinner -
Yes -
And the 9:30 news meeting is waiting.
Damn. It's doing it again.
What's wrong?
The back-up does the same thing.
How is it now?
A dead head. Water logged timber. Floats straight up. You sometimes see them on the east side of the channel - from the logging camps on Sumatra - but they don't usually float this far west. Muncy! Engines to half!
Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.
What is HE doing here?
Obviously, the British government denies all of this -
- I told you! He was there! -
He brought that up from the wreck.
...Well! I do believe this requires further investigation!
Thank you, Uncle Elliot.
How sweet.
That was too close.
The drill is in the water; approaching the intake tunnel.
Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember you fondly.
Approaching the first gate.
Bore through. ...They used to say living well was the best revenge, Mr. Bond. They're wrong. Revenge is the best revenge.
Hong Kong, Mr. Bond!
You have to leave -
Take the men. I can finish alone.
Is the helicopter ready?
Fueled and waiting.
It's a trick! After him. They're in the south stairwell!
They're on the bridge. Seal off the 50th floor!
- Built to withstand a nuclear blast. Are they alive?
Yes. Shall we kill them?
What the hell is going on?
It's Bond!
I regret to inform you, sir, that Saddam Hussein is still demanding a bonus for his role in the Gulf War.
...Haven't we already paid him for his services?
... And there's no truth that 10% of that money will go into your Swiss bank account?
No sir! I swear! This is not true!!
Please sir. Please -
Mr. Stamper will escort you to the plane.
What about ID's?
Oh, no.
Who is it?
Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.
Who is that?!? What's in the box??
I don't know. He's not in the database -
Will it go off?
Maybe. Maybe not.
Soviet SB-9 nuclear torpedo. Yield, one kiloton.
Will the cruise set it off?
What time is it? Do you think you can just treat us like your slave? It's after one.
I tried to call to let you know I was going to be late.
I pay my own way.
Your mother asked me not to mention it but your mother's birthday was last week.
I hadn't forgotten. I ordered some cloth but it didn't come in and I felt so bad if I would have come to her birthday without that, I just stayed at home.
What did your wife get her?
Why, you don't want us to bring him over?
No, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? You guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night. You are into yourselves, as the saying goes. Spend some time trying to be parents. Take him to the mountains, fishing. You ought to let him get to know nature.
Well, you are his grandfather. He is supposed to spend some time with you. You're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that.
Junior spends time with his child.
Babe Brother, is that my shirt that you're wearing?
Yes.
How come you're not wearing my shoes?
When are you boys going to fix that roof?
Soon as I rest a bit. I meant as soon as we are back to normal again, anytime.
When are you going to find time to help me fix the roof?
You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.
You used that excuse to get out of the army.
You want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours? You know the last time we went into something together Daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street.
Why are you always afraid to get somewhere?
This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal.
This is what it is all about, trying to keep from being out on the street.
Robert asks about you. When are you going to do something to help him?
Why in the hell didn't you help mama?
I told her I would if she would give me time.
I bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the roof, you would have rebuilt the whole damn house.
You always got the best of it around here and when Dad always talks about my son, it is always you, so you fix the roof.
That is a damn lie and you know it. Every time father asks you to do something, you either half-ass do it or run off and hide. Mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her, with your smart ass self, that you weren't a farmer; get Junior to do it. Every time someone asks you to do something,
I told you about calling me boy. I ain't no boy. See, you and Dad got a bad habit of calling me boy. You call me boy in front of my wife. You think I'm going to fix the roof? I hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain.
I'm leaving and don't even call me when the shoe falls 'cause all he did for me was to try and run my life. I'm tired of people saying Babe Brother this, Babe Brother that. What's my name?
You dumb ass, it's Babe Brother.
I'll drive her to the hospital.
I'm cold. I need to get out into the sunlight.
Because you were spoiled, don't try to spoil Sunny.
My daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it. Every summer, the way they kept me and Junior out of trouble was to send us to Big Daddy's farm. We would get up with the chickens. Every summer the fence had to be repaired. The barn needed a coat of paint. We had to pip all of Big Mama's hundred
I want Sunny to have an advantage that you and I never had, but he needs discipline, and you are not helping when I tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it.
What is a sip of coffee going to do?
Coffee is bad for anybody, especially for a child.
I don't see you crying about my drinking it.
Why don't you come in for a while?
You would think people never lived in a house if they have to ask what does 1 1/2 baths mean.
Will you still get the money from your father?
I told him we might not need it, if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property.
Pops put Big Daddy's farm in Rhonda's and Sunny's name and fixed it so no one can borrow on it.
We could borrow on that land and put the money to work.
Why does he always pick on me?
He is just being like all parents, concerned about the ones they love.
Linda, how come you don't see that Sunny puts his shoes on right?
You okay?
I have more sense than to give up everything, my family, you and Sunny. It wasn't me, I mean the real me inside my body. I'm glad it's over. It's like a veil has been lifted.
Like a veil has been lifted?
It's like I've been swimming in muddy waters.
Like muddy waters?
It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.
You were in hell?
I couldn't believe the things I was doing. It was like an internal struggle going on inside my body.
Do you think you won?
It was nip and tuck.
And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br... Sam... I mean Samuel?
Who is it?
I was hoping you came to the door instead of him. It gets cold at night.
This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.
Doesn't he look a whole of lot better?
I need to get my suitcase out of the garage.
What for?
I'm going back home with Harry.
I've heard some foolish things in my life.
Harry is coming to pick me up.
Have you lost your mind? Have you thought about your wife and child, not to mention your sick father? And I need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling.
I'm busy.
Don't make me raise my hand to you. You have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction.
Can't I be myself without you jumping in with your right and wrong? The world is not black and white. Show me one perfect person. If you can't, don't ask me to be.
Did you ever have to use this thing?
Don't pick up the cards if you are not in the game. Did he die?
What is that?
Never play with someone's else's cards. You always get a new deck. Look at this card. See anything?
It is just a regular card.
Son, would you do me a favor and see if you could turn off that tap in the bathroom. My hand is too weak. And would you do me another favor? I don't like asking this but would you clean the tub for me? I have trouble bending over.
I could swear I heard my son call me.
You probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over there.
I don't want to wear out welcome, but you can stay in someone's heart longer than you can stay in their house. Come with us, boy. We are going to have a good time.
This would be a bad time for me to leave.
You know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock.
I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.
Not anymore, not in the city.
We grow most of our own food. The money I get from social security, my pension and my wife's work, keeps us living on the edge. What choice do people like us have.
Well, you just have to move further out.
Now how far would further out be?
My mind plays tricks on me. Is it okay if I take a bath now?
Babe Brother and his wife are taking advantage of a situation. I hate to be mean to people but picking Sunny up when they feel like it has to come to an end. Now I'm going to ask him how come he couldn't be at your birthday.
Don't bother the poor boy. It just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are.
Let us settle this tomorrow.
Your feet are cold.
Go back to sleep.
I asked you to wake me when Babe Brother comes.
You all act like two roosters.
I'm not going to let him get away with murder.
You and Babe Brother are so much alike...
He ain't nothing like me. How come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart? You ought to stop protecting him.
Hush.
You're always taking his side.
Hush.
I'm trying to make him a man but you keep babying him.
You know, Babe Brother's wife just dumps greens in the pot without washing them.
Well, it's up to Suzie.
Do you want your coat? It's cold out here.
No, I'm too hot now.
You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.
I wouldn't care if I drop dead if he learn something from it. Son, you make me wish I was dead.
Let us go back in before the night of celebration becomes a night of me killing my son.
I'm worn out.
Just stay in bed and rest.
I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up.
You stay inside. I will see to them.
It's good to be able to hear that.
You must have been really sick.
How is the garden doing?
I need to get out there and get those weeds out.
What, are you having another party?
You better come sit down. You are still sick.
Since this morning.
What happened to your hand?
What did you put on it?
He's going to check out heaven first. He gets a round trip ticket to heaven. He gets in heaven and finds it just like back home. People dripping with sweat, working in the fields, hardly surviving. He asked a man who was getting a drink of water, "I thought the streets were paved with gold." "They are but you won't see them," he said.
I don't want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell. You're being irreverent.
I'm almost finished. I'm about to come to the punch line.
I don't want to hear any tales about colored people...
But these are white people, anybody. The punch...
I don't care to hear any jokes about people being in hell. This cut on my hand reminds me that it is nothing to laugh at.
This is my grandson, Sunny. He is my youngest son's child.
Boy, that is bad luck to touch a fellow with a broom.
I came all the way from Detroit by bus going to Oakland. The bus stopped in Los Angeles. I had to get off and take a rest. I'll catch the last bus leaving at midnight. I'm just too tired to go on.
Why didn't you catch a plane?
My feet have never been on anything that wasn't directly attached to the ground.
Stay until you feel better? I would like to hear all the news.
Man, put your boxes down and stay as long as you like. We have empty rooms since the boys got their own families and moved out.
Man, act like this is your home.
It's the boy next door throwing at his birds. I'm just waiting on him to hit a pane in the window
Good morning.
You ought to come hear our preacher. Remember old Cat Iron? Well, our preacher is just as strong.
Next time when I feel a little better perhaps.
I was going to get up and get a hen out there for dinner, but time got away.
Oh, I would feel much at home if you let me get one for you. I haven't wrung a chicken's neck in a month of Sundays. You know, folks would call my daddy to kill their hogs. That used to be my trade from time to time.
How often is your wife called to help delivery?
What could have caused this? I just changed this damn thing.
Everything these days is made overseas.
You and Babe Brother hit it off so well.
Course, it is your business, but I feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the boy.
I tried to teach him right from wrong just like I did his Junior.
Everyone has to follow his own plough. A man doesn't have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays. City people don't give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays. You don't plant old ways... ... but, at the end, you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land
You're suppose to teach your children what you know. Junior, I don't have to worry about. Babe Brother is a different story.
You still call him boy. You call Babe Brother boy in front of his wife and son.
My daddy called me boy up to the time he died. I was always boy to him.
Haven't the years been good to Hattie?
Boy, I thought you were about to cross the river.
Stranger my foot, it was my grandmother who helped you into this world.
Good evening. It must be all the different time zones I crossed that makes me feel this weary.
You should go back and rest.
One can tell you are from back home. These people nowadays don't know what manners are.
Those days you could always find something redeeming about even the worst person.
You remember that boy who lost his mind, Joe? You could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark. He wouldn't miss a one. Make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe. He would pick up a brick and say "go on in there brick and hit somebody" and it would find its mark.
I was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom because of him.
I have someone I want you to meet.
Harry, you know everything.
What's the problem here?
How is everybody?
Ah, you young folks don't know how it is. How is Gideon today?
He wasn't able to get out of bed today.
I hope that it's nothing serious.
He has never gotten rid of the malaria. He is usually up and at it the next day. I'm going to make him fresh chicken broth.
Can you watch Gideon for a while? One of the girls is going into labor. Junior is going to drive me over.
That smells like fresh coffee.
Let me get you a cup?
How is he doing?
As long as he keeps his throat clear, he is able to get some rest.
Good afternoon, ladies.
As God is my witness, I have never done anything to that woman.
You must have done something to her.
Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.
Hattie is a different person now.
I don't make no bones about where I'm going to spend eternity. I have always been wild and you know that. If you are made to feel half a man, what do you think the other half is?
I'm glad you brought that up as to who you are. I have to know who is in my house.
You invited me.
There is something that I always wanted to know. Tell me, how did those boys die?
Now who are we talking about?
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
Wasn't Hocker lynched?
You know as well as I do that it was made to look like he was lynched. Now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree?
Hocker's death almost caused a race riot. A lot of innocent people could have been hurt behind that.
I think if anybody had a hand in killing Hocker, you ought to ask or you should have asked Emory and Chick.
Chick was outright killed by a mob. He killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him, they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town.
Those boys never did have good luck.
You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin.
A woman in family way just reminds of spring and my younger days.
That's nice.
How many people do you all feed?
Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
Good God Almighty, bless your bones. But the problem grows.
Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.
I don't know if we could take one in with Rhonda and me at home alone at times.
I couldn't believe it when Suzie called and said you were staying here. How have you been?
Girl, do you still sing and dance?
Harry, that's not nice. I'm in church now.
Why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone? I remember when you weren't saved. That was way back yonder when the Natchez Trace was just a dirt road.
Some people grow up and change their ways.
I know your mother ain't still operating that house of hers.
None of your business.
You know the saying, "your heart is in your left hand."
Now I was trying to be nice, to make conversation, since we go back some.
I was quoting from the Bible. If the shoe fits, wear it.
An empty wagon makes a lot of noise and you, tappy head, you ain't worth the salt you put in greens.
Is this your house?
In the meantime Harry can slaughter us a hog.
I appreciate you lending me a hand. That lazy ass brother of mine was suppose to help me.
Well some folks are still waiting for their comeuppance. Don't take me wrong but you can't judge people by how you act. You're a caring person.
He should be caring. That is not too much to ask.
Ya, but you can't do the shuffle with one leg. You and your wife, in your spare time, work with the less fortunate. Now I'm not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim, deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying.
All the people working with us are really doing it 'cause they hate to see suffering.
You don't act like the rest of Gideon's friends. They believe if you are not hard at work, you are hard at sin.
Not you mustn't touch. Your mama might not like you handling knives.
I think he wants to see your rabbit foot.
I let this rabbit foot do in place of my toby that I lost years ago.
What's a toby?
You don't want to be at crossroads without one. It's a charm that old people teach you how to make. I had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child. In my travels I misplaced it. I have been looking over my shoulder ever since.
I thought you weren't old fashioned.
Did you have your child at home?
No. No. No. No. I had my Child at Cedars and Sinai. And that ain't no county hospital. You have to have cash or check before you come in the door.
Some folks take that natural stuff too far.
Junior's wife kept her afterbirth' in the refrigerator. That's why I do not eat over there now.
No, but I might have some Indian Chief Tonic.
You know Harry lied about how that boy Hocker got kilt. And it was Harry who saw Emory last before they found him hanging over a levee like someone would hang a hog.
I remember Harry always trying to help someone. He got Lulla's daughter out of trouble. He was always running to the store for someone who couldn't leave the house.
You know Okra asked me to marry him the other evening.
Rush your mouth, girl. No, he didn't. He cannot be that big of a damn fool.
I asked Harry about it. He didn't own up to it. He said he didn't know what got into Okra.
He's just raffish. Harry put him up to it. Before evening sun sets, I would have his belongings back on Route 55, that old fox.
I can't accuse him just dry long 80.
Everybody who have been associated with Harry end up with pennies over their eyes.
What must I do?
We can't really bring another family in here with us.
Why not? Harry says that's the only way to do good.
When did you talk to Harry?
He just leeches off your parents. He is a master at wearing out welcome.
Harry is the kind of guy you would love to take out in the woods and leave under a rock.
Now you don't have to say anything if you don't want to.
You shouldn't talk about the boy's father in front of him. This is family business and we have to pull together.
What are you doing?
Counting the gray hairs in your head.
Counting the what? What does that have to do with the price of butter?
I was just trying to make conversation.
Where is Skip?
He is in his pigeon cage.
I'm sorry he got those birds.
How are you?
Tolerably well. I brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses.
I didn't mean for you to pay me for that.
I know you didn't but you have been so thoughtful.
But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them.
Wow! Cool!
Whadda ya think?
Can we leave this up 'til we move?
Well, sure, we can leave it up.
Yeah!
Now go get Molly. Your friends are going to be here any minute.
Come on down, guys. It's time for games! We've got prizes!
To infinity and beyond!
Oh, all this packing makes me hungry. What would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?
Can I bring some toys?
You can bring ONE toy...
Mom! Do you know where Buzz is?
Andy! I'm heading out the door.
But Mom, I can't find him!
Well, honey, just grab some other toy! Now c'mon!
I couldn't find my Buzz. I know I left him right there.
Can I help pump the gas?
Yeah?!
Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
Next stop...
Mom, have you seen Woody?
Where was the last place you left him?
Right here in the van.
Oh, I'm sure he's there. You're just not looking hard enough.
I looked everywhere, honey, but all I could find was your hat.
But what if we leave them behind?
Everybody say, "Bye, house."
Hey! Wow!
What? What is it?
Woody! Buzz!
Oh, great, you found them. Where were they?
Here! In the car!
Which one can I open first?
Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo.
I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.
Oh, hey - it was nothing.
Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
You'd think they've never seen a new toy before.
Uh, let what? I don't -- Uh, what do you mean? Who?
What are you doing over there?
We're almost there.
Whoooooah! Oh! Bo! There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention.
Say, isn't that mistletoe?
Hello-o-o...
Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot.
I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?
Well, let's see, we've got double A's --
Yes. They're Andy's toys.
Toy?
T-O-Y. Toy.
Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.
He's not a Space Ranger! He doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly --
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and I CAN fly.
No, you can't.
Yes, I can.
You can't!
Can!
Can't! Can't! Can't!
I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer! Prove it.
Why, thank you. Thank you all. Thank you.
Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away from Andy. He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.
And another thing. Stop with this spaceman thing. It's getting on my nerves.
Don't even think about it, cowboy!
You actually think you're THE "Buzz Lightyear?" Oh, all this time I thought it was an act! Hey, guys! Look! It's the REAL Buzz Lightyear!
You're mocking me, aren't you?
Oh, no, no, no... Buzz, look! An alien!
What's going on?
Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
That's why. Sid.
Sure is a hairy fellah.
THAT is Sid!
I could have stopped him.
Buzz!! Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!! Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness! We've got trouble!
Trouble?! Where?!
Down there. Just down there. A helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, Buzz!
Right? Buddy?
I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
Oh. Oh, that's good.
But we're not on my planet, are we?
According to my nava-computer, the --
Shut up! Just shut up, you idiot!!
Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!
My fault?! If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --
Oh, yeah? Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
Buzz! Buzz, come back!
Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
Uh-huh. And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, let's get in the back. No one will see us there.
Ow! Watch where you're going!
Wait a minute! No Buzz! This way! There's a special ship. I just saw it!
You mean it has hyperdrive?
C'mon, c'mon, that's it...
Spaceship.
What's gotten into you, Sheriff? I was --
I've set my laser from stun to kill.
I sure hope this isn't permanent.
Woody, we don't know what's out there!
They're gonna eat us, Buzz!! Do something! Quick!
It's not working. I recharged it before I left. It should be good for hours --
Get away! Hoo-cha! Hoo-cha!
Hey!! Hey! How are you doing that? Stop that!
Woody, stop it!!
Another stunt like that, cowboy -- you're going to get us killed.
Don't tell me what to do!
What happened to you?
I think you've had enough tea for today. Let's get you out of here, Buzz.
Oh, I'm a sham!!
Sh-h-h-h-h!! Quiet, Buzz.
But -- the hat looked good. Tell me the hat looked good! The apron is a bit much, it's not my color...
Come on, this way!
Oh, come on, Buzz. I...Buzz, I can't do this without you. I need your help.
I can't help. I can't help anyone.
Why, sure you can, Buzz. You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
Andy's house. Sid's house. What's the difference.
Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly. You were right all along. I'm not a Space Ranger. I'm just a toy. A stupid little insignificant toy.
Whoa, hey -- wait a minute. Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
Yeah, right.
No, it is. Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY! You are HIS toy.
But why would Andy want me?
Buzz!! What are you doing? I thought you were --
Come on, Sheriff. There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing.
Woody! It's the moving van.
Shhhhhhh!
What?!
Nice work, fellahs. Good job. Comin' out of the ground -- what a touch! That was a stroke of genius.
Hold on, Woody!
I can't do it! Take care of Andy for me!
Well, thanks for the ride.
Great!
Woody! The rocket!
Woody?! What are you doing?
Ha-ha!!
Ahhh!! This is the part where we blow up!
Hey, Buzz!! You're flying!!
This isn't flying. This is falling -- with style!
Uh, Buzz?! We missed the truck!
Me? No, no, no, no... Are you?
It doesn't matter how much we're played with. What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us. That's what we're made for. Right? Everyone is now looking down, sheepish.
Pardon me. I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock!
No, no! Turn 'em around, turn 'em around!
Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
It's not a laser! It's a little lightbulb that blinks!
Oh, impressive wingspan. Very good!
Hi!
Something's screwy here.
Oh, boy. Will ya take a look at all those presents?!
Hey, watch it!
Let's string him up by his pull- string!
B-3.
Miss. G-6.
Ohhh! You sunk it!
Heh-heh.
Are you peeking?
No, no, not the ear. Gimme the nose. C'mon!
Son of a building block, it's Woody!
Oh, that is disgusting.
What?
Did I get my package in the mail?
I dunno.
Whaddaya mean, you don't know?
I don't know!
Oh no, Hannah!
What?
Hey!!
She's sick!
No she's NOT --
I'll have to perform one of my...operations!
Sid, give her back! Give her back now! I'm telling!
MOM!! MOM!!
Oh, no!
Where's my ear? Who's seen my ear? Did you see my ear?
Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in your spot, Woody.
Oh, really? I'm from Playskool.
Gettin' kind of tense, aren't you?
That ain't no happy child.
Huh?! Huh?! I told you he was guilty.
Aa-a-a-a-ah!
Will you quit moving around?!
I'm sorry. It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
Well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move. I'm not worried. You shouldn't be worried.
A lunchbox?!
Laser-envy.
Yeah. Like the attic. Heh, heh...
Who is it this time?
Wait a minute. You -- you don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you Potato Head?
That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
Good going, Slink! Now, just, just tie it on to something!
Did you all take stupid pills this morning?! Have you forgotten what he did to Buzz? And now you want to let him back over here?
No, no, no! You got it all wrong, Potato Head. Buzz is fine! Buzz is right here. He's with me!
You are a liar!
Wait just a minute. What are you trying to pull?!
No! No, no, no, no!
You murdering dog!
No, it's not what you think, I swear!
No! No! Don't leave! Don't leave! You've gotta help us, please! You don't know what it's like over here!
No wait! You don't understand! Buzz is out there! We've gotta help him!!
Toss 'im overboard!
ROOAAAARR!!!
Were you scared? Tell me honestly.
C'mon, guys! Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.
But what if Andy gets another dinosaur? A mean one? I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?
Yes! Yes! We promise!
Shouldn't they be there by now? What's taking them so long?!
Ha ha. That's very funny, Buzz. This is serious!!
Hi ya, fellas. To infinity and beyond!
Hey look! It's Buzz!
They're getting bigger.
What the heck is up there?
It's Sid!
We believe you, Woody. Right, Rex?
It's too short! We need more monkeys!
I got it, Woody!
Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
Sir! No Sir!
Sargent. Establish a recon post downstairs. Code red. You know what to do.
Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha Bravo.
This is it! This is it! Quiet, quiet, quiet!
Okay, we're on the last present now...
Last present!
Mission accomplished. Well done, men. Pack it up, we're going home.
There.
Juvenile intrusion! Repeat! Resume your positions NOW!
Buzz. Buzz Lightyear. You are not worried, are you?
Yessss! Ah, ha, ha, ha...
Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl.
This is ludicrous.
Not now, Mom, I'm BUSY!
Reach for the sky!!
This town ain't big enough for the two of us!
Somebody's poisoned the water hole...
W-w-w-we?
Hey, Slinky?
I'm red this time.
No, Slink --
Oh...well alright, you can be red if you want.
Not now, Slink. I've got some bad news.
Bad news?!
Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting and be happy!!
Woody, what are you doing under the bed?
Heh, heh, heh! Golly bob howdy --
Woody?!
Boy, am I glad to see you guys!
Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too.
Woody! Speed up!
I can't hold on much longer!
You'll need to know who we are, we're the brothers of his wife, which makes us in an unsanctified kind of way, your uncles. Me name is Finn, me brother is called Francie -
But you're Irish!
You'll put your clothes here.
There's no mirror.
I can manage.
He's a pyjama case, really.
Do you know you've lovely hair, even if you torment it in those braids.
I like plaits.
Curled up on the landing like love locked out!
I did like the music.
He can't abide a woman in trousers. He says a woman in trousers is a sin against nature.
A sin against <i>what?</i>
Is there anything else I should know about him?
I saw his teeth in the bathroom.
Mummy was scared of him, I think. He went to her wedding but he was <i>furious</i>, you can see it in the photograph.
He made that. In his off hours.
It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside.
Don't fret. It's only his dream. Dreams aren't catching, not like measles.
I want to go home.
Home is where the heart is.
She's not accustomed to being ignored.
She'll have to learn.
What was <i>that</i> in aid of?
That's your beach. This is the story. Leda walks by the shore, gathering shells. Night comes on. She hears the beating of great wings and sees the approach of the swan. She runs away but it bears down and casts her to the ground. Curtain.
Is that all?
Finn, there's a splinter in your left foot. If you don't let me take the splinter out, it will fester.
Go away.
I won't do it because he wants me to do it, even if I want to do it.
Do what? Oh, I see.
You're only a young thing.
You're not so old yourself!
Who's there?
Can I come into bed with you for a little while, I feel terrible.
Well ... yes. All right. But -
Would you mind holding me in your arms for a little while?
Finn -
You <i>are</i> cold. Where have you been?
I finished it off.
He'll murder you when he finds out.
He'll be looking for another apprentice.
I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.
The swan was so ridiculous. All the same, it did scare me.
Stop it!
I've got a present for you...
Finn ...
Reprieve.
Somebody couldn't wait until dark.
H'm?
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.
It was only a mouthful!
I thought she was fondest of you, because you were the youngest.
Did you now.
Surely she is older?
How long has -
I already lost everything once.
So did I.
But then I had a brother and a sister left.
So had I.
Everything is gone, now.
'Have ploughed the stormy seas - '
They're going to fly everywhere. Mean things. They should have taken us.
We're too young.
I'm not too young. Juliet was my age.
Juliet who?
I'm Melanie.
Did you do this?
Victoria -
You're well built; how old are you?
Sixteen. Well, nearly sixteen.
Oh no you can't. Get on with the painting.
I appreciate you coming in so early.
Judge Wakefield, it's an honor to handle it for you. Consider it gone away. She's a minor; it probably would've expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.
Still, this was a sensitive issue for me and I wanted to thank you personally.
One thing bothers me... That kid they dropped off had coke and heroin in him. Serious amounts. He's lucky he lived. So I gotta ask: what's your daughter on?
I don't know what you mean.
I... I don't really know.
Is she in any kind of therapy... professional help?
No, of course not. She's one of the top students at her school.
Even if that were true, they're not going to come to your house where you're waiting for them.
Anna. What's wrong? What do you want?
I can't find Manolo.
He's not here.
He never came home last night. Was he with you?
What? What is it?
Why does he need money?
He has debts. He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.
How much?
What is he planning on telling them?
If Manolo hadn't gone and told them what he did then Salazar and Madrigal would never have been brought to justice. He did a great thing for Tijuana. He did a great thing for Mexico.
I want to believe you. I really do.
Helena, I'm so sorry --
I understand. You're upset. You want to know what's going on. That's good.
Why are you talking like that?
Good. From now on I want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape-recorded, that the movement of your lips is being read. Got it?
Got it? Good. Do not discuss anything over the telephone. Do not talk to the neighbors. Stay out of your yard.
What is he being charged with?
I don't know, but under no circumstances would I talk about it here. I want you to go home and relax the best you can. Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very important.
Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.
I am on the board of my son's school. I had a fundraiser for A.L.V. in my front yard. I have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman.
If all our assets are frozen and our "sales force" has scattered... How am I supposed to survive? I'm giving birth in three months. How do I get through this?
You're gonna get through it, but the first thing we do is get Michael Adler to represent Carl. We get Adler and we beat this thing.
How much do I pay him?
This place is swept twice a day. I learned that in Miami in '85. Then the U.S. shut down the whole Caribbean, but it's a big game of wack-a-mole. Knock it down in Miami, it pops up here. And San Diego is so much more relaxing.
Arnie, I need money. Somebody threatened my children. They want a first payment of three million dollars.
Helena, if I had it I would give it to you, but I don't have that kind of money.
Arnie, help me. Doesn't anyone owe us money?
Yes, I told you before, there are people who owe you money but they're not paying. There's too much heat on Carl.
Even if I knew I wouldn't tell you. You do not want to come into contact with these people. Only Carl knows who they are. That's his real asset. Ruiz doesn't know them. They don't know Ruiz. Church and State.
What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate --
Laundromats for the washing of money. Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business.
Sometimes I wonder what I'll do if Carl doesn't get out. I'm not very adept at being on my own. I've always had a man in my life. Always.
I remember when I first met you: little Helen Watts from the wrong side of somewhere. I had a feeling even then that your survival instincts were pretty well honed.
That was a stupid thing you did. Incredibly stupid.
I tried, Arnie. And, I will continue to try.
Have you gone crazy? You are not Carl. You aren't as good as Carl. They are moving the trial to a high security location. The press has gone berserk. The jury will be influenced. Stay out of things. Let us try to win the case.
Helena, please. This is out of your hands.
Helena --
I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers.
Did you get it?
It's the same stuff? From the rainy day stash?
It's Saturday, Arnie. You work too hard.
Don't bother.
What?
So Arnie, when were you going to tell me about the 3 million dollars we got in from San Francisco two days after I got arrested?
I was just waiting for the right time.
And you didn't feel like you could trust my wife with this news?
I just didn't want to take a chance. I didn't want to risk it. It could have been frozen along with everything else.
You had it all figured out. You move into my house. You raise my kids. You sleep with my wife. It was a good plan, Arnie.
Carl, that's insane.
So my wife is lying?
Arnie, do think there's a difference between a reason and an excuse, because I don't think there is.
Carl --
Like a Grateful Dead Concert.
So you know we put the case before the arbitration panel, none of whom had any expertise. Superfund is just one of those words. People stop paying attention.
That's frustrating.
I think she's lying.
Me, too.
We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit. School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly. Christ, this could be embarrassing.
Honey, this is difficult, but we've all had our moments. I tried --
Stop. You experimented in college. I don't want to hear about that.
Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?
This is different.
Why?
To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old.
I think she has to find out for herself, on her own. We have to allow her space --
Space for what? To O.D. like that other kid? I will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents. Because it isn't. Correct?
How long have you known?
Six months. I found some marijuana, that's all. And a little pipe about two inches long. I talked with her. She said her friends smoked pot and drank --
Explain to me how you could think that I shouldn't know about this. Explain to me how this wouldn't be relevant to me. As a parent.
I think we may have found our Mexican Drug Czar. It's this General, Salazar. At least I'll have somebody on the other side I can talk to.
You might want to pencil in a little face-time with your daughter.
Barbara --
Because I'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert.
The first thing we have to do is present a unified front.
If you start in on the war metaphors I'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole.
Look, I'm as worried as you are --
No, I don't think so. Leave me alone, give me money. That's what I get from our daughter. She has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar.
I'm not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello.
I have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day. That's different.
Oh, it is?
Should we bring the police into this?
About the other night, I'm sorry.
Me, too.
God, I don't get it. Are we supposed to say to ourselves, be prepared to lose her, be prepared to lose our child? Why does this happen to someone? How does it happen?
My Leica's gone.
So's the video camera.
Where are you going?
Did you meet the President?
Czar for life, just like a real czar.
None of my friends can fucking believe my dad is the actual Drug Czar.
Caroline --
Did you tell Dad?
Not yet.
Are you going to?
I don't know.
Is this bad for him?
He didn't hang around us. He's like one of those hippie kids. I'm not part of that group. It was a party in all these rooms. His girlfriend who I barely know was completely hysterical... He's blue, he's puking... We didn't want to get in trouble, but what were we supposed to do? I mean, what would you have done if you had been
How well do you know this boy, Seth, who was driving? You know the police have charged him with a DUI and possession of marijuana.
Hi.
Hi.
What's up?
Just watching you.
You all right?
How's David?
How's David? How's David? He's terrific, Carl.
Helena --
We'll get through this, I promise. I'll make it up to you --
How? Supportive letters from prison while I'm being kicked out of our home? Do you have any idea what is happening out here? Our credit cards are maxed. The people at the bank, you should see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an
Helena --
What's it like? Imagine you're being accosted by a swarm of beggars in the heart of Calcutta, except the beggars are wearing $1500 suits and they don't say "please" or "thank you."
What about legalizing everything? Has anybody talked about that?
What if every country legalized at the same time?
As it happens, the President of the United States, my new boss, the leader of the free world, has me penciled in for some "face time".
Will we get invited to the White House?
I don't know.
How long's the job?
Where is it? Where are the drugs? Where are they?
Okay, young lady, that's it.
What is wrong with you? What? You're going away. You're getting help somewhere.
You can't make me.
...How old are you?
Sixteen
Live with your parents?
Yes.
Parents still together?
Yes.
Do you work?
I volunteer. I read to blind people. One day a week for two hours.
In school?
Private?
Yeah.
How are your grades?
I'm third in my class.
What's that mean?
I get A's. All A's.
You do? What else you do?
What are you doing?
Inhale the smoke and hold it.
What is this, like freebase?
Ach, that's what I'm talking about. Sarcasm. Always fucking sarcasm. You're afraid and you think if you admit it people will think you're weak or won't like you --
Are you kidding... I'm staying with you --
You know my dad takes eight red cold pills every day? He and my mom have cocktail hour every night, from six to seven, set your clock, two bourbons --
Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind --
Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day.
Have you done your homework, honey?
Yes, mom --
Did Courtney Love play Nancy in Syd and Nancy?
I think so. If she didn't she should have. I've only got maybe an hour. Then volleyball practice is over and I have to be home.
No telltales. Nothing to read. Not touching my face. Not even blinking. No giveaways. How're you feeling?
I feel good.
No more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh?
Chill out --
Move 'em to Texas, fry 'em up.
That's a big word for a fisherman.
They're whispering. I can't hear them, but I know it. I smell conspiracy. I feel the lie vibrating out of the home.
She ain't in on it.
I have dreams about this, actual dreams about busting the top people, the rich people, the white people.
I'm telling you, she doesn't know shit.
She knows Arnie Metzger.
So does half of San Diego.
You should see little Montel play. Little Montel is the next Maradona.
Maradona is a cokehead. Hand of God, my ass. We're wasting our time here.
He won. He was a winner. That bothers you.
Are you getting this on tape?
What do we do?
What do you think she wants?
Remember when we sat on that mob guy, that chef, for like six months?
Oh, man, I've never eaten so good in my life. Why don't you develop a useful skill?
What do you think it is?
Depends who it's from.
Your friends at Warren, Putnam and Hudson.
You can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff. Three categories: you like me, you hate me, you want something from me. Definitely third category.
What would a law firm want from the new drug Czar?
Depends on the state.
Arizona.
I'll put this in the back.
No --
All the professionals keep them in the trunk.
Not Tiger Woods.
David --
Women's room, stall two. Should we stop for ice-cream?
Yes.
I'm on a special phone, may I speak freely?
You may speak.
You were followed by the police, but they won't hear us over the children. I want to use a bomb.
You're kidding. Can't you shoot him or something?
I don't really like guns. You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive.
When will you do it?
I don't know. Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl. The security is very tight. There may not be a way.
They're going to walk right past me.
So, it's worth the wait, right? What can I do? Rent a Huey? Have an airlift? It's not like you can put it in a condom up some mule's asshole, right? How many peasants would that take? A line stretching from here to Mexico City --
You planning on going somewhere, Eduardo? You don't like it here? This is the best situation you're going to have for a long, long time.
I am a legitimate business. Fishing boats. Tuna. Check it out. Tax records, everything --
Listen you motherfucker, you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon.
You can't visit me here. I want my lawyer.
One chance here, Eduardo. Make us believe you got a boss. No boss, it's all on you.
It's a death sentence. I'll never make it to the trial.
Carlos, I mean Carl, started out in the family connection business: real estate in Tijuana, fishing boats out of Ensenada, hydroponic raspberries. He met up with the Obregon brothers of the Tijuana Cartel who were interested in two things: entering society and using his fishing boats.
So you pay off our customs officials?
This attitude's not gonna help him any, is it?
I got greedy. I decided to bring a little in on my own and somebody tipped you off. That was my mistake. Carl would never be so stupid.
He hired you. That was a mistake.
This is ridiculous. Why is there no elevator?
You expect me to be grateful for spending the rest of my life looking over my shoulder.
Can't you for a second imagine none of this had happened? That my drugs had gone through. What would have been the harm? A few people get high who are getting high anyway. Your partner is still alive. We avoid having breakfast together. Don't you see this means nothing? That your whole life is pointless?
You're breaking my heart.
The worst thing about you, Monty, is you realize the futility of what you're doing and you do it anyway. I wish you could see how transparent you are. This food tastes like shit.
So go shower already.
I want to know who is responsible for this treatment.
Yes, sir!
We aren't barbarians.
Yes, sir!
Bring this man a change of good clothes. Has he eaten?
I don't know, sir.
Yes, he threatened to kill my five year-old son. I was under the impression I would be meeting Juan Obregon.
No, this is not possible. And I thank you for coming down here, though I suspect it's been a pointless journey.
Why do you say that, Mr. Marquez?
I hear these stories. Your husband in jail. His business in chaos. Various people fighting over the scraps.
My husband is the victim of an informer in your organization, not ours.
That is not true, Mrs. Ayala. Your route is compromised. Perhaps it is time for me to deal with other distributors in California.
I don't think you're going to do that.
You don't? Listen to this woman in a man's world, a very violent world.
There are plenty of other suppliers in Mexico.
My husband had been working on something he called, The Project for the Children. Are you aware of this?
I don't know. Perhaps I remember something.
We have the ability to change the color, odor, and physical property of cocaine.
You want to smuggle narcotics in Mr. Espastico Jacobo. That's nothing new.
Every part, from his ears to his accessory belt, is high-impact, pressure-molded cocaine. Odorless. Undetectable by dogs. Undetectable by anyone.
You first.
I'm six months pregnant. I won't do it.
Fine, then we don't have deal.
That's good coke.
It should be... It's yours. I want our debt forgiven. I want to be the exclusive distributor of Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the United States. And I want the principle witness against my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.
Take this back with you. Deliver it safely to Tigrillo in San Diego and we have a deal.
That's crazy. My husband is on trial for smuggling.
You will help me with my other problem.
Wasn't that General Salazar?
Yeah.
What's he doing up here?
Relax. If they were going to kill us they would have done it in the desert.
If you want her to stay out of it, then stop telling her everything. You should learn how to keep a secret.
She's nosy. She hears me on the telephone.
Please. Filing a report will not help you find your car.
This is fucking crazy. Instead of killing us, he sends us on a suicide mission. Do you know who Frankie Flowers is? He's a psycho-cokehead- hitman. A faggot. He's killed fucking who knows how many people. You'd need half the force to get close to him. And you can't get their help because he lives in fucking San Diego.
A group of us are going out tonight.
Who?
Guzman, Tomas, Esteban --
Your new friends.
Yeah. It should be fun. You wanna come?
It's no problem. I was just with everybody we work with.
Oh, really. General Salazar was there?
No, but a lot of other people. You should come. You should come out with us.
Madrigal's alive.
What?
Javi! Come on. Don't pull this you don't care bullshit. This is incredible information. It must be. Javi --
Somewhere safe.
Where?
A place we have, that we know is protected.
It's important that we work together. Mexico. America. One hand washing the other.
We agree.
So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations.
We thought maybe you'd have that kind of information for us.
You should feel good about this.
What's your name?
Javier Rodriguez.
One question. How did you find about this?
An informant.
What is the name of your informant?
That's your past. I want to talk about your future. Would you be willing to do something for me?
If I can.
I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.
What is it you want me to do?
Does this offer include my partner?
