Just get him to stop.
What do you want to do, leave the station with her?
Yes.
Kelvin, she'll disintegrate. You don't believe me? Let's radio that shuttle pod you launched -- better yet, let's go get it. I've charted it's trajectory, only take a few hours...
Her oxygen would have run out.
Who are you trying to please? Yourself? Her? Which her, this one or that one. Can you face both? We are in a situation that is beyond morality. So: Leave with her. You'll see the transformation.
Into what?
You'll see her die, that's all. They're mortal, despite what she told you. She will die. Then what will you do?
I love her.
What's wrong with you? We need your help.
When did this happen?
Oh, right away. That's why you never saw me with anyone. You should've noticed that. I miss him, though. I think I made a mistake.
Jesus...
But I can't leave with you. I won't make it.
Oh, God. I'm awake.
I need to see Snow.
I'll go with you.
Don't.
Why?
I don't know. I can't be alone.
What are they?
To calm your anxiety.
We're taking a flight?
Rheya...
"And Death Shall Have No Dominion".
Book?
Poem. Dylan Thomas. I thought of it when I saw you on the train.
Not a very happy poem.
You didn't look very happy.
I wasn't.
And tonight?
You want to fuck her?
Stop it.
You behave as though you want to fuck her.
Rheya. Not here.
And I just want to know if I'm crazy or not -- if what I think is happening is actually happening. Or am I one of those people, those women, who are blind to what's going on? Who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman?
Let's go home.
You go home.
I am. Please come with me. I don't want to do this here.
You're better when you take them.
I know, I know. But still, somehow I don't feel better.
What do you remember?
What do you mean?
Do you remember Beethoven? The Beatles? Movies, books, restaurants, friends?
Is it a planet?
Not exactly. It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe. An infinite number of them, in fact. It was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the Universe, Space, or Space-Time. It was completely counter-intuitive. We had to unlearn everything.
Is it intelligent?
Intelligent beyond our comprehension.
Then it's God, right?
It's something.
You still don't believe in God?
The whole idea of God was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called Man. Even the limits we put on it are human limits. It can do this, it can do that! It designs, it creates!
Even a God that wasn't active, that just created something and stood back and watched?
But what if Solaris is what there was before The Big Bang?
As I said, it is beyond our comprehension.
What happened?
You were trying to break down the door. Do you know why?
Where've you been?
I would have these -- I don't know how to describe them -- visions, when I was younger. Maybe not visions, but like these waking dream states. Time would just collapse, I would be inside time. I would stare at a second hand on a clock until it stopped. Freaky stuff.
How old were you?
Seven, eight. So one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space, and she asks me what I'm doing, and I start trying to explain to her, about this state that I can put myself in, and this look comes over her face.
Scared. No, not scared. Wary. Like I was something to be... her guard went up. I was a threat. Now I know why. She was afraid she'd be seen. That I would see her for the self-obsessed neurotic that she was. I think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal. But that's the cycle, right? I knew a
Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you. I loved it so much, that feeling.
What happened to us, exactly?
Why did you say those things?
I can't help feeling that I'm cheating when I take them.
Do you have any idea how much I like fucking you?
I think so.
I like that too.
How could she not be real? I can smell her, taste her. She does exactly what she did... it's not possible.
You sure say "God" a lot when we're doing it.
What does Snow think you should do?
Sartorius wants to destroy it.
Well. He doesn't think it's God, but for different reasons than me. He's thinking: If I can figure out how to make it stop, than I am smarter than it is, and therefore it cannot be God.
He has a point.
He does have a point. That's just not the way I'd like to see it proven.
You feel sorry for Solaris, or for me?
It's a violent response to something we haven't figured out. Don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: He is ruthless. Unblinking in his prejudice.
Do I really feel like... I am...?
Yes. Yes.
What's wrong.
You don't love me.
What are you talking about?
Who have you been talking to?
Sartorius.
I'm sure there are worse people to talk to, but I don't know who they are.
But we fought.
Yes. Especially toward the end.
Why did she do it?
You... she said I didn't love her.
Was she right?
No. I love you.
Can you sleep?
I don't think do. It's not sleep; it's something else. It's all around me.
You're the coward.
Don't debate him; he'll say anything.
You don't want me.
Rheya.
That's what you were saying. I heard what you were saying.
I have these strange thoughts, I don't know where they come from. I can't explain it.
Neither can I. Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before. It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap. There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us.
But that's what happened before.
Do you want to stay here?
Do you?
What's wrong?
Gibarian. He was here.
You said he was dead.
What's happening to us?
It's all right.
Please don't lie. I told you before, I don't know how I came to be here. Whatever you think you can't say to me, I need to hear you say it.
I love you.
That won't happen again. We're different.
How could it be so cruel? How could it torture us like this?
I'm not Rheya. You've always known that.
Rheya --
Listen: I don't care about anything but the fact that you are here. You are her, you are Rheya.
I'm disgusting.
No.
You're lying. I'm not human.
Rheya, I am not going back. I'm staying here with you.
Then you'll die.
Don't do this. I am literally begging you not to do this. Chris.
You should have told me.
It wouldn't have made any difference.
Thank you.
Chris, I had to. I had to. I didn't think you'd react like this.
Neither did I.
You never said you wanted one.
I never said I didn't.
Chris --
I can't stay here.
Chris, please. Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it.
What do I have to do to stop it?
I want you here.
You're lying.
You exist here. I keep telling you.
That's impossible. I'm not Rheya.
Who are you, then?
I... I am Rheya. But I am not the woman you loved ten years ago.
Yes, you are --
Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being. I'm an instrument. I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what. Even if I remain passive. That's when I drank the... I was going mad. It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else. An illusion. But I could feel
Yes. I told you. It was exactly like mine.
Is that really what you want?
I want to stop taking those pills.
I wish you wouldn't.
They do something to me. It's hard to think straight.
I think they help.
I have consciousness, but I am not mortal. Don't you see why I'm going crazy?
You have to remember that I love you, that's all that matters --
I can't --
It put you here. I'll admit it, it acted like a God and put you here, put you into my consciousness. I was asleep, and it put you into my dream. I saw your mouth. And there you were. Whether you've been sent here to make me happy or punish me, it doesn't matter. The decision we make now is all that matters. Stay
Am I really her?
What are you taking?
What does it want?
I've decided that if it is God, it's a sick God. Its ambitions exceed its powers, but it doesn't realize it. It's created a situation without a goal, and I hate that. A God whose passion is not a redemption, who saves nothing, fulfills no purpose. And us? We would have to have "an arrangement". An unspoken understanding that I am not human. How
Where did you go before?
When?
Last night. You were talking to someone in the corridor.
How can you be here...
He won't do it.
Why do you say that?
We thought you'd be alone. We want to talk about...
They are not autonomous individuals and they're not actual persons. They are projections materializing from our minds, based on a given individual.
A recoil, with no compensating mechanism.
And when a given situation no longer corresponds to the normal faculties of the... original, the visitor suffers some sort of disconnected consciousness.
Followed by non-human manifestations.
Gibarian was under enormous --
Snow, get up here, now.
I got rid of him. I wanted to see if... I wanted to be the only one. I wanted to be Snow.
You want it coming back with us?
Claire!
Skiddy and Kit? I haven't seen them since that shitty pasta dinner on the cape.
They've got two monsters now. Both boys.
And so what's with Steinhart? Is it serious?
You didn't like him?
Looks a little constipated to me.
It's terrific Win.
You still writing the occasional magazine article?
Occasionally.
I've never seen anyone killed before.
Straight ahead.
Hi.
I'm sorry. I'm not sure how this works. I have to go out... is that all right?
Uh...
I have to pick something up before Bergdorf's closes, then stop at a reception just a few blocks away.
I think, maybe, that isn't such a great idea...
Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?
Right. That's true.
Can we go then?
I'm supposed to call in.
Do you have another tie? Something more conservative?
What did he say?
You live in Manhattan?
Queens... You know Queens?
I'm supposed to speak at their tenth anniversary.
Are you nervous?
Would you pick one out, please?
Beg pardon?
Put it on my account, please.
You can touch me, I won't bite.
People think I'm stepping out on Neil. We're causing quite a scandal.
Hey! There are crazy people here.
Let's get a drink.
I'll have a spritzer, order something soft for yourself... I must go for a pee.
I'll come with you.
Hi. Just checking to see if you're here.
You all right?
Yeah.
I'm sorry about what happened.
Listen, that was my fault.
I shouldn't have listened to you, I should've followed you right into the "can" the way he did.
I guess I'm supposed to do it in the morning. Identify him.
Sooner, the better.
He said he'd kill me.
Big talk... Desperate guy.
Claire?
Hmm...
You wouldn't happen to know what language they speak in India, do you?
Urdu and Hindi.
Didn't do very well, did you?
Nope... never finished one yet. I hate these things.
You were reading my Renoir.
How did you know?
You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir?
They're kind of fuzzy.
You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind.
So, this could be your last night, huh?
Could be, I guess.
Want to go out for a drink? I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail...
You mean to tell me, a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way?
That's the dumbest walk I ever saw!
No, no seriously! There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!
Hey. This is my business. Do I tell you your business.
... It was like... the minute I saw her... I knew. She looked so damn adorable in a cop's uniform... puttin' on a big, tough act...
So it was "love".
Yeah. It was.
Yeah.
That's nice. And you live in Queens? With a child, and a dog...?
No dog.
I saw you with a dog, in my mind.
No dog.
But "nice".
What about Neil?
You don't like him, do you?
What's to like?
Tell it like it is.
You asked.
He's very caring, in his way. You haven't seen him at his best.
You could do better.
It was nice having you "watch over me"...
Good night, Mike.
Claire?
What do you want?
Open the door, will you?
I can't open it.
You put me life in danger.
No, you'll be safe. We're gonna pick him up again...
You told me I'm safe? I'm going for a walk in the park.
Claire, will you calm down?
I'm perfectly calm, I'm a normal human being. I'm going for a walk in the park.
Stop, will you?!
Let go!
Stop being nuts!
I trusted you! I thought you cared about me?!
I do care about you!
Yeah.
They called here after you left...
I don't know you...
This is me, Mike. There's nothing else...
You don't wash your clothes at the Boulevard Laundromat... you don't pick up your kids from some crummy public school... what is this? A fuckin' joke?
You told her?
Not exactly.
What do you want to do?
You don't want to know.
Oh, I do want to know. I tried to reach you at the precinct.
I've moved into Scotty's... Good news about T.J., though. Looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through.
Oh God, that's great!
Are you okay?
I'm taking them all out to Queens, as a matter of fact, right in your neighborhood. There's an event at my Father's school... an anniversary... I thought maybe you could come...
Oh that thing in Queens.
Where?
When can I see you?
Oh yeah. When is it? This thing in Queens.
Tomorrow night. Can you come?
I don't know. It wouldn't be very smart.
Claire...
No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls. I'll be fine, really.
What a memory.
Do you dance?
Do you?
Pretty bad.
They guys treatin' you all right?
Yeah.
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
It wouldn't work.
I'd miss my life...
How long you going away for?
Long enough.
"For"...?
I'll have to pack a lot of clothes.
... Mike.
Claire!
Everyone's all right...?
So.
You still going away?
I don't know...
You don't have to, now.
I'll miss you, Mike.
I like your coat.
You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
Say goodbye, Mike.
Hello, Claire. How extraordinary that you came.
It was something my father always liked me to do.
You're planning to speak?
Not if you don't want me to.
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
... just saying you should think twice about it...
... You know, and I know, that the only thing standing between a life sentence for Venza and his freedom is my testimony at his trial...
Claire...
... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...
Win made his choices, Claire. We all do --
You're dealing with a psychopath. He gets out of jail in ten years, or five... or ninety days, and you'll be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life...
What am I supposed to do?! I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it! I can't just -- "let it go away"!!
Keep what handy?
Nothing.
We're not going to the game, are we Mom?
Mom, what's going to happen with you and Dad?
Hey, can we go to McDonald's?
Tommy...!
Think I should put the skateboard in bed with him?
Ellie, you know I think it's about time we got outa this place, get us a house of our own. We can afford it now.
Amen to that. The supermarket's full of assholes.
Mike?
What?
My ass if falling.
Your what...?
My ass is falling. It is.
What are you talking about?
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
Get in bed.
What am I gonna do? I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity...
Tomorrow, I start looking for our house... You love me?
You got no idea...
So how'd it go?
For how long?
Don't start... The only reason is that the neighborhood's shi... ... crummy. I just don't like the idea of leaving you alone here at night.
I can still use a gun.
Changing the sparks. They showed it on TV. What d'you think?
I think television's a dangerous thing.
Hey. The neighbors.
I read the article. You didn't tell me she was so beautiful.
Okay?
The real estate lady left, she couldn't wait anymore. What took you?
Oh, some shit.
What shit, honey?
Honey. You got him.
I don't know that Ellie. He might get out. Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be.
She's got to identify him.
Why?
Because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals. I can't believe you're talking this way Mister Detective -- I think she's got a lot of guts.
I think -- she's crazy.
I'd identify him.
Oh I can see you've had a bad day. We'll see the house another time, okay?
No! No! I'm sorry. Ninety-seven five right?
Bought it.
It's not your taste.
What did she say the down payment was?
She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one.
She took you shopping for a tie?
I had to follow her to a store.
What's wrong with your paisley tie?
Ellie, it was a formal party...
Excuse me! You went to a party with her?
I'm her bodyguard, goddamnit...
I know you're her bodyguard. Did she buy it or did you?
She bought it.
Why?
Coming to bed?
Few minutes. Want to catch the news.
Should I wait up? We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.
What?
Mike, take it easy...
Take it easy! I set her up. I saw it coming.
It's not your fault. Mike, please get off the case.
It is my fault! I'm responsible for her!
Did you hear what I said?
I'm sorry. I know I heard noises... the detective's wife...
C'mon, don't make an issue of it. Do you want the fucking meatloaf or not?
D'you have to say "fucking" every other word?
What was that?
You heard me.
Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap.
What're you talking about --
You gotta get another tour. We're gettin' too old for this.
I'm sorry.
What did you do tonight?
I watched TV.
What did you watch?
Hey, we qualify for the Senior Citizens Early-Bird Special... Did you see Tommy today? He misses you...
Well. This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon.
I'd like you to switch to the day shift, Mike. To be home for dinner. Helen insists that T.J. be home for dinner... That's why he's on the morning shift.
Well, T.J.'s... seniority... and all. I'll talk to Garber about it.
I already did. I mean, I talked to his wife, and she talked to him...
My wife talks to his wife about what shift I'm gonna take?
Let me drive...
Get away from me... get away! She means that much to you, you stay with her. But you come back, you come back for me. Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me.
I'm going to visit my sister for a few days. I'd like you to get your stuff out.
What about Tommy?
Was it Venza? Did you get him?
Ellie...
He doesn't want to sleep here. Neither do I. It's not my house anymore.
I don't know how you did it, but whatever it was, keep doing it.
I just sat and listened.
Why not Patrol? They'd do just as good a job.
What about when she goes out?
But I got him! He's in jail! Wasn't that the point...?!
You apprehended him after he gave himself up --
It wasn't a bad bust. He gave himself up because he knew I was gonna nab him.
Anyone who turns himself in makes a good case for bail.
Even Joey Venza?!
He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move. We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved "good will" by turning himself in.
What about when she identifies him?!
They're operating on him. He's still alive.
I heard a lot... Anything you want to deny, Mike?
What do you think? Any chance? There's nothin' else I'm any good at, but this.
At my house...!
Let's go. We're takin' her home! Move it! Get the cars!
Koontz! I need you guys!
We'll call SWAT. We'll get the locals. Throw it!
No One-Seventeen, they'll fuck it up! He told me not to tell anybody, to bring Claire and come alone! He won't wait, he knows I'm two minutes away! Koontz, please!
Hey Mike, out of the bag into the bureau, huh... How do you like it so far?
Who's Joey Venza?
Shit! A Nursemaid! My first detail, and I'm a fuckin' slug! I got a 'choice' at all.
Do it, or look for another profession. That's a choice I guess.
You in this with me?
Not Koontz.
Wasn't your fault.
Tell me I'm dreamin'.
Uh, yeah. I'm a policeman.
Ever shot anyone?
Yes.
Does it make you... hard?
... Hard?
Are you in charge here?
No, sir...
I asked for the man in charge...
That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
Don't tell me he's "busy". I asked for an ambulance for this woman and...
You're not going to talk to anyone without a lawyer.
She's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness. Could I ask you to step outside, please.
No, I will not step outside.
Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone. Help me out here, could you please leave.
You're here 'til what time?
You made a terrible mistake, Keegan. You didn't do what I said.
That's right, you're gonna do what I say. Joey. I want to help you out of this.
You should'a brought the girl.
Hold it...!
How do I know that's her?
I'll bring her in. You let them go, and I'll bring her in.
Why should she come in?
She trusts me. She'll do what I say.
Bullshit! Prove it.
I want your guarantee they'll be turned loose when she opens the front door.
I get my hostage first. No one's turned loose until I say so.
Let my kid go.
I'm not lettin' no one go.
Get that gun away from his head, or I'll keep her from coming in! Put the gun on me, he can't hurt you! He's tied up! Put him under the table!
Don't you fuckin' give orders to me...
Under the table.
Watch your step!
What're we having?
My special, scrambled eggs surprise.
How do you know where the gun is?
I know where everything is.
Except the goddamn skateboards, which are everywhere! I'd like to kill the guy who invented those things.
Lay back, Mack.
God! Scrambled eggs surprise?! These are pickles...! God!
Nice threads Dad.
How are things going, pal?
Okay, I guess.
How about dinner tonight?
Mom and I got plans.
What "plans?" You and Mom got "plans?"
She's taking singing lessons.
She's what?
What! What kind of pathetic line is that?
You coming in?
No, I'm not coming in. And if you'd rather go to a "singing lesson" than have dinner with your father...
We're not going to a singing lesson, she's just gonna start taking singing lessons.
So, what are you doing tonight?
Shooting.
Shooting?
Tommy! The guy's a sleaze-bag. She can't sing.
I don't think she can sing, either.
Sexual tension...
Time to get my bowling ball re drilled.
Well, look who's dressing for success.
And Flash isn't?
Peter-- you took this picture?
Here you go, Pete.
Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
What, want a glass?
So, uh... how's college goin'?
Same old stuff. How's the pharmacy?
Ah, ya know. Neighborhood's not what it used to be. Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
You stop him?
Wasn't worth gettin' upset over a Milky Way. Anyways, I was never much for, ya know, discipline.
I know. Still thinking about retiring?
Ya still follow the Mets, Pete?
No not really.
S'funny. When your mom and dad, uh, passed away, I had this idea. I wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world.
Remember Little League?
Ya set for, uh, ya know-- money?
Oh, sure.
Cause if you get in a bind--
No, no.
Yeah, ya like to do things on your own I been thinkin' lately. Maybe I wasn't the, ya know, greatest dad--
Oh, come on, Ben ,that's not--
When you won that scholarship, I was proud of you.
I know.
Yeah, take pity on the feeble minded.
No, no, listen. They're tryin' to say he was in cahoots with this killer--
Flash, drop it--
I was there.
See?
Lizzy!
I was sort of hoping to get out of--
Hey, guys. Check it out-- I saw this dud on the tube last night. He is incredibly cool.
Mistake? Hey, guy, get back here!
Flash, get lost.
You maniac. You'll blow your scholarship.
What's in there?
A little bunny I saved from dissection.
Ooooh. Your feet are on fire.
Harry
"Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University."
"Scholarship students must maintain dignity at all times."
I know. I've got one too.
Great idea. Let me get some shoes. I'll take you home.
You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me?
Don't be pitiful.
Jesus Christ.
Mm-hmm.
And you let me go on about Rosomoff working me too hard? I feel like a complete idiot.
You get mugged or something?
Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
Oh, I need your notes from the classes I missed.
Well, I've missed a lot of classes myself...
Now tell me you love me.
Lemme down, bugface!
Are you okay?
How are you doing, kid?
Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--
You can be great, kid, just stick with it. But let me give you one little piece of advice... be a good guy.
Too hip. Your photos suck, kid.
Come on, that's pure luck! The guy was in the right place at the right time--
You taking extension classes, Mr. Jameson?
Parker-- you go here, right? Got your camera?
Yeah--
Get inside and get pictures. Fifty bucks.
Can we make it a hundred?
Can't focus...
I bet you don't think I appreciate you, Parker. I do.
Well, thanks. You wouldn't believe what I went through to get those. Right after you took my camera, this ambulan--
I like enthusiasm. That's why I use a lot of smart-ass kids. Not just 'cause they work cheap.
Mr. Jameson--
I got a question, college boy. What the hell am I supposed to do with these!? I ask for disaster, pathos, what do I get? Salvador Dali! When I want artsy-fartsy double-exposures, I'll ask for--
Double-exposures? But they're not-- I was in--
I don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em! I can't print this surreal garbage!
You print pictures of Bigfoot!
Bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them. Did you get pictures?
Mr. Jameson--
No! Washington Square, manhole covers turn into flying saucers and radios explode like A-bombs. Did you get pictures?
Can I get a word in edgewise?
Relax, Jameson. This is business. I know you want photos of me, so I'll give your boy Parker an exclusive. On one condition--
I don't submit to blackmail! The first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as I imagine it, and--
Would you cool it already?
Thank you. Now, repeat after me-- Spider-Man is a good guy. On the side of right, and niceness, and cute baby animals and all that.
Frmpph-yrr.
Oh, that? It'll come unstuck in a half-hour or so. Your mouth needs the rest. Bye.
No refund on the mask, y'know. Health laws.
Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight. Bright colors. Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
What's this? A cockaroach?
Eh. Week from tomorrow.
How about tomorrow?
You're making my life difficult.
Two suits by tomorrow for $400?
An even five I throw in the jacket.
Is that bug juice, or are you just glad to see me?
Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
I see. So, Amazing Spider-Man-- I'll assume that's not your given name--
Just call me Spidey.
Can I get you a snack-- a housefly, maybe?
Thanks, I already ate.
I'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
All right, amazing. Are you quite finished?
Are you quite finished?
He left. I couldn't believe it-- he just left! It's as if he's somewhere else... I'm only getting a piece of him.
When Peter was little, he loved to hide. In closets, under the sink. He needed a secret place. But when I'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
Maybe I was hiding. For years, I never told Ben the one important thing.
He knew.
Some things you should say anyway.
Even if they're not clever.
Even if you've heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written.
What if you get hurt?
Good morning, Liz.
How very dull, Peter Parker.
It's never too early to be clever. Describe in a sentence how you feel about me.
Huh?
Fill in the blank: "I blank Elizabeth Allan."
I-- uh--
Uh is a good start.
I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise--
I hate the Platonic idea of you.
I hate people with alliterative names.
I hate--
No. I was lying about the coffee.
-- but the dogs treed him between Huxley and Kafka.
Poor Harry. Always desperate for attention. What about the bunny?
He'll weasel out of trouble. Again.
Maybe. I could have stopped it, though.
My my.
I suppose.
You want to give them something, but they'll just buy more Ripple. And they smell so... bad.
God, Flash can be such a jerk.
But you like that in a man?
You should write that one down.
"Flash," Liz. You're going out with something that calls itself "Flash."
Some prep school thing.
Does it have a human name?
Eugene. Admit it, Peter-- you'd do anything for a nickname like "Flash."
I'd never admit that.
What are you doing this weekend?
I've gotta study.
Eat alone, gotta read. Social defense tactic 17 Peter, that jacket is foul. Lose your glasses?
Brrr. It's colder than New Hampshire in here.
Don't misquote Othello at me. Besides, you'd have to care about somebody to strangle them.
What's your problem?
Sit down and stop being such a child.
This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
What's in the bag? Garbage?
Sort of. I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back.
Oh, don't do it on my account--
No, it wasn't only you-- it -- it just wasn't my style. Hey, look-- let's go to lunch. Someplace nice for a change.
This from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?
-- but at least Aunt May's okay now. I really have to stop by the hospital this afternoon.
Do you mind if I come too?
They keep saying there's nothing I could've done. That's a lie. I could've done something. If only I'd paid attention to my feelings.
You're not trained for that. None of us are... I mean, sometimes I... Okay, let's say you had gone back. What then? Are you bulletproof?
Well, no.
So? The next day I'd read, "Peter Parker murdered," and I'd feel...
You'd feel what?
Listen. You think you're responsible for everything that happens. Don't flagellate yourself - and don't flatter yourself, either. You're not the center of the universe. You're just... Peter.
Am I? I'm not so sure. I used to be sure of a lot of things. Oh, different things from week to week, but now-- I'm not sure of anything anymore.
Hello. Earth to Peter. Are you listening?
I'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon.
May's much better. She'll be out soon.
Oh, God, I forgot to--
Ssh. I always thought she was a strong person. She is-- but not for the reasons I thought.
Strong...
Peter?
Hello, Liz.
Hello. So very boring. Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
I... I like you. A lot.
Hold it. Can we stop being clever, just for a moment?
This may be the end of a beautiful friendship, you know.
You were the last one to see Thorkel. In Octavius' hospital room.
So you've found Thorkel?
Octavius wasn't the murderer type.
But you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--
Waldos.
Lieutenant, I've triangulated recent bizarre events-- the Bronx, Jersey, Brooklyn-- all rippling out from-- Here. The E.S.U. Science Center. Octavius' experiment seems to have opened a hole in space-time, drastically changing the interrelation between molecular binding, electromagnetism and gravity--
Yeah, that's fascinating, but I'm just a fat, dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer--
Toxic dumps, huh.
And he'll need a cyclotron. He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it. Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard. New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge--
You sure about all this?
Of course.
It's a lot of ground to cover. We'll try. Funny coincidence, huh?
No such thing as coincidence. "God does not play dice with the universe."
Einstein, right? We'll see ya.
Yeah, Roz.
Any sign of our friend?
Roz? Rosomoff? What is it?
There's nothing in there worth stealing!
Aunt May, you're trespassing.
When I moved out, you swore up and down you wouldn't meddle--
I am old enough to--
--but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
I'll introduce you.
Ick. And those foul chemicals in the pots--
I'm a photographer, remember?
It's Friday night...
Yes. Do you have a date?
The record--
What the hell is that?
Oh, not that. You promised you'd burn it.
Absolutely no class.
Funny thing happened after my physics class today. Harry Osborn--
A match made in heaven.
Peter, you're bleeding.
It's fine. Tell me what--
Oh, Ben gets through everything.
Aunt May, what happened?
I was napping on the couch. There was a voice and a shot. I woke up. Ben was looking at me.
How is he?
Poison emergency.
Hi. I've got sort of a hypothetical question. Do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?
Is this some sort of Zen thing?
I mean, I suddenly have immense physical power, and the ability to crawl up walls--
Do ya? Lemme give you the number for Bellevue. That's 561-5151--
Ha. Anti-gravitational particles.
Power down. I need to talk to you.
Proof. Proof of a unified field. Not just theory and equations-- experimental proof.
In this obsolete little cyclotron, I'm solving the greatest physics problem of the 20th Century. With more power, I could--
Then the alumni reports came in-- fund-raising is down this year.
What you've done is make the entire physics department look foolish. You compare yourself to Einstein; your colleagues compare you to Bozo the Clown.
You've used up your grant. The electric bills alone exceed your annual salary. Not to mention the potential hazards of your radioactive fuel.
That Nobel Prize will just have to wait.
Then you'll be glad to know the University has decided not to press criminal charges against you. Breaking and entering the minor matter of the total destruction of a 23 million dollar cyclotron
I will finish what I've begun
Otto, I don't like Thorkel any more than you do. But he has got a point.
Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
No. No thank you. I have work.
I heard about Thorkel's order--
A bit melodramatic but if you could prove it that would tie in your unified field theory, the Big Bang, Kaluza-Klein--
My self. I don't matter. This human life, all life- insignificant. Bodies-- bags of sleepy, sluggish flesh.
All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
Creation? Or its opposite?
Otto, we are mere mortals. You must never forget your own limits--
I'll repeat the experiment. I will hold the truth. That's the only thing that matters.
Life and death matter. Yours-- everyone's. By comparison, our search for truth is only a product of curiosity, a game--
My God, Otto, you have to hear me! The world we know will collapse! Everything we have devoted our lives to-- all patterns, all harmonies-- will be destroyed!
Truth. Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...
Mr. Parker.
Peter, what can I do for you?
An extension on that astronomy paper? Because, uh...
Your dog ate it.
Actually, I got this spider bite
Pretty lame for such a smart kid.
Fortean phenomena. Anomalies in our so-called reality. Weirdness, my boy, and lots of it.
Caused by Doc Ock's experiment?
How much do you know about it?
Not a lot. I saw inside of the Science Center. What exactly happened?
Need any more help?
This photo you took of "Spider-Man" -
Luck. The right place at the right time.
Really. I'd like to speak with him.
I don't think I'll be running into him.
You never know. Go get some sleep.
The paper, my boy. A solid B-plus.
Oh. Yeah. Thanks.
Kid, you were terrific. Max Reiss, novelty acts. Was that judo or something? Ah, skip it. Question is, can you do it again?
Hello, uh, Mr. Reiss? I'm-- I'm the guy who wrestled Hulk Hogan the other day. The guy in the mask?
I was hoping you'd call, babe. Look, you got representation?
No
Good. We'll make it oral for now. Meet me at Rockefeller Center at six tonight.
Why? It is a wrestling match, or
Where'd you get the clown suit?
Like it?
So they're airing this tonight?
... a couple a drinks at Sardi's?
What?
I asked if you felt like a drink--
No. No, I-- my aunt and uncle. Something's wrong -- I need to make a phone call.
Mr. Reiss-- I need a quarter--
I sent for the police. We can explain.
Explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad scientist with four tentacles?
You're sure you're all right.
Yeah, just a lung full of New Jersey. Lucky you showed up when you did.
Logic. Lot 49 is the closest stockpile of SL 270-- I do feel foolish talking with a man dressed like a--
Imagine how I feel.
Excuse me if I'm impertinent, but-- how did you become whatever it is you are?
The usual. Heredity and environment. What's the deal with Doc Ock?
He'll try to finish his experiment.
And blow up the universe just to prove he's right? Bit egotistical, isn't it?
A messianic complex is nothing new to Octavius. In his universe, there's only one mind-- his own. It must be very lonely.
I listened to him talk of eternal truth and thought of the Bhagavad Gita, the Indian holy book-- "I am become Shiva, Death-- the destroyer of worlds." Octavius was...
Bonkers.
Loonytunes. And yet...
Do you... live around here?
No, but I've got this secret identity to worry about. I'll swing the rest of the way.
I see. Well, Octavius won't get much further. They'll catch him and... put him away. Sad. He might very well have the truth.
Spider-Man, be careful! He's quite mad.
Professor, you ever fly one of these things before?
Up here, Docky Ocky!
Don't let him kid you. Cagney couldn't have pulled a sweeter job. All right, boys. We were waiting in the depot in Frankfurt, see? And there was an ammunition train coming through, the longest ammunition train you ever saw, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room, see? Fixes himself a time bomb, busts open the window and just as the train moves
I wouldn't talk about things like that.
They never caught on.
What's wrong with him?
How did he ever find out about that ammunition train?
You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
Jawohl.
Is you all good Nazis?
Jawohl.
Is you all little Adolfs?
Jawohl!
Maybe just a hint or so. Think hard.
We made a deal with Barrack One.
Any news on Dunbar?
Do Cagney. Like you did yesterday.
There was that ammunition train in the depot at Frankfurt, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room and fixes a time bomb, see? Then he waits until the train starts moving out, see? And one of the cars got the door open with some straw on the floor, see? So he throws it, see, and three minutes later -- voom! See?
Throws what? How could he have a time bomb?
Just pulled the old match gag, see!
What's the match gag?
Where's Hoffy? Why don't we get any news about Dunbar?
Don't worry. He'll be all right.
I had to be the ham! I had to shoot off my mouth!
They ought to be under the barbed wire soon.
Come on!
Ready?
Roger.
Three's a crowd, especially if you've got to cut your way through barbed wire. Here's the wire cutters. Are the civilian clothes ready?
Coming up.
W-w-will that do or do you want some m-m-m --?
There's only one pair left.
What's the matter? You on their team now? You think I'm the guy?
I understand how you feel, Cookie. It's sort of rough -- one American squealing on other Americans. Then again, Cookie -- maybe that stoolie's not an American at all. Maybe he's a German the Krauts planted in this barracks. They do this type of thing. Just put an agent in with us -- a trained specialist. Lots of loose information floating around a prison
In this barracks?
Why not? Just one of the boys. Sharing our bunks. Eating our chow. Right in amongst the ones that beat me up. Except that he beat hardest.
Who is it?
That's not the point, Cookie. The point is what do you do with him? You tip your mitt and the Jerries pull him out of here and plant him someplace else, like Stalag Sixteen or Fifteen. Or you kill him off and the Krauts turn around and kill off the whole barracks. Every one of us. So what do you do?
If you don't want to tell me, why don't you tell Hoffy? Or Security?
So long, Cookie. The department store is all yours. What's left of it.
Now what kind of a crack is that?
Hold it, Sefton. So we heard some shots -- so who says they didn't get away?
Private property, bub.
Come on, Trader Horn! Let's hear it: what'd you give the Krauts for that egg?
Nice guy! The Krauts shoot Manfredi and Johnson last night and today he's out trading with them.
What's your beef, boys? So I'm trading. Everybody here is trading. Only maybe I trade a little sharper. So that makes me a collaborator.
A lot sharper, Sefton! I'd like to have some of that loot you got in those footlockers!
You would, would you? Listen, Stupe -- the first week I was in this joint somebody stole my Red Cross package, my blanket and my left shoe. Well, I wised up since. This ain't no Salvation Army -- this is everybody for himself. Dog eat dog.
Static is right! The radio's static, Patton's static, we're static!
I suppose they also know about your distillery and the horseraces?
That's right.
Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
I grease the Kraut guards. With ten percent of the take.
And maybe a little something else?
Yeah, what about it? Cut the horsing around. We know he's the stoolie and we know what the pay- off is. Let's get on with it.
Let's get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
You make my mouth water.
What are you looking at him for? Any objections, Sefton?
Next we're going to auction off your department store -- and your stable.
Have a cigar.
I wouldn't worry about Schulz. I'd worry about Sefton. Remember me? I'm the stoolie.
You ain't going to squeal this one, brother.
Here's the knife to do it with. Only make sure you got the right throat.
Brother, were we all wet about you!
Put me down for ten, you louse.
Don't ask me. Price was elected Security.
Come again?
Break it off!
How much more do we have to take from him?
How did he get over there?
The S.S. Men are here to pick up Dunbar. They're taking him to Berlin. Looks like he's finished.
Then we're all in on it?
You killed them, huh? Both of them?
Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
Cut out the guff, Schulz. We're on to you. You know everything that's happening in this barrack. Who's tipping you off?
Come on, Schulz! Spill it! How did you get the information? About Manfredi and Johnson? About the stove and the tunnel? Who's giving it to you? Which one of us is it?
That's the general idea. Only it's not so general as far as I'm concerned.
Lieutenant Dunbar? It wouldn't be James Schuyler Dunbar? From Boston?
Maybe he would. We applied for Officers' Training together, remember? They turned me down, but I'm glad to see you made it. Of course, it couldn't be that all that dough behind you had something to do with it! His mother's got twenty million dollars.
Twenty-five.
What did you expect, glamor boy? The Officers' Club with a steam room and a massage maybe?
Just a minute. You made a couple of cracks before and I let them slide. But I don't intend to take any more. If you resent my having money, start a revolution, but get off my back.
Shut off the moaning, or we'll have the dogs on us. Shut it off, Lieutenant. This is orders!
My legs are frozen.
You'd better get that blue blood circulating, because we're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly -- -- one minute and twenty seconds.
Sefton!
What did you expect, a St. Bernard dog?
Not you.
What some brandy?
Yeah.
Who doesn't! Suppose we wait until we hit the Waldorf Astoria.
It's on me.
You won't get off that cheap.
What are the chances busting out of here?
Let's blow, Chauncey.
I am Lieutenant Dunbar.
What is your number?
105-353.
That is correct. Lieutenant Dunbar, I came to apologize for the accommodations. Ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men.
I'll live.
Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt! They are very angry in Berlin. They will be even angrier on the East Front, waiting for that ammunition train. Don't you think so, Lieutenant?
I don't know what you're talking about, Colonel.
Of course you don't. Now, Lieutenant, how would you like to join me in my quarters? I have a nice fire going.
I'm okay here. Why bother?
No bother. I'm very grateful for a little company. You see, I suffer from insomnia.
Ever try forty sleeping pills?
You have no idea how boring my life here is. If it weren't for an occasional air raid or some foolish prisoners trying to escape, I wouldn't know what to do. I want to thank you for keeping me company. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't read. I hate music. That only leaves good conversation. It will be a shame to lose
I didn't do it -- I didn't do it.
You are being rude again.
I want to sleep. Give me five minutes on that couch.
Nine-thirty. General von Pfeffinger should be at his desk by now. Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?
There will be two S.S. men here tomorrow to take you to Berlin. You will be interrogated by the General Staff. When you come to the part about your arrest, I'm sure you won't forget to give me the proper credit.
I want to sleep... I haven't slept for three days.
I didn't do it. I was in the Frankfurt station and the train was three miles away when it blew up.
Oh, come now! You threw a time bomb.
Here we have a typical barrack. It houses seventy-five men. Every one of them has his own bunk, naturally.
Naturally. It would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.
As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
What do you do for heat in this barrack? No stove?
The men here used it for a trap door, so we had to remove it temporarily.
Well, Herr Inspector! How did you find the camp? Crowded but gemuetlich, shall we say?
I want to talk about Lieutenant Dunbar. Is this Lieutenant Dunbar?
It is.
What exactly is he charged with?
Whatever it is, it's out of your jurisdiction. This man is not a prisoner of war. Not any more. He is a saboteur.
And the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely.
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
You were saying --?
Simply this. After the hostilities are ended, there will be such a thing as a War Crimes Commission. If this man should be convicted without proper proof, you will be held responsible, Colonel von Scherbach.
Interesting.
Very well. If you insist on details. I have ways of finding out about that blasted time bomb. Good day, sir. You will forgive me for receiving you like this?
Aufstehen, gentlemen! Please! You do not want to stay in bed on such a beautiful morning we are having today!
Say, Schulz --
Jawohl?
Sprechen Sie deutsch?
Jawohl.
Then droppen Sie dead!
Jawohl!
Wisecrackers? Where did he pick up his English? In a pretzel factory?
You always think I am a square. I have been to America. I wrestled in Milwaukee and St. Louis and Cincinnati. And I will go back! The way the war is going I will be there before you!
Hey, Schulz! I got a deal for you. Suppose you help us escape. We'll go home and have everything ready for you in Madison Square Garden. For the world championship! Schulz, the Beast of Bavaria versus Halitosis Jones!
Why don't we accept, Animal? The worst that can happen is we wind up a couple of lamp shades.
What is this? This is water?
It's a mouse trap.
When you get going on those broads, think of me!
Shut up, Animal!
Good morning, Animal! What'll it be for breakfast? Scrambled eggs with little sausages? Bacon and eggs sunny- side up? Griddle cakes? A waffle?
Stop it, Harry!
Coffee? Milk? Or how about a little cocoa?
Why do you do this to me every morning?
I'll kill you, Harry -- so help me!
'We will remove the iron stove -- the one that was camouflaging the trap door.'
I'm telling you, Animal, these Nazis ain't Kosher.
You can say that again!
I'm telling you, Animal -- these Nazis ain't Ko --
Hey -- Russki -- Russki! Look at those bublichkis! Over here!
Look at me! I'm your baby! Get a load of that blonde one! Built like a brick Kremlin!
Hey -- Comrade! Over here! This is Harry Shapiro -- the Volga Boatman of Barrack four!
Let me go! Let me go!
It's chow, Animal! Chow!
Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there!
No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
I don't care if they wear galoshes!
You want Betty Grable!
Let me go!
Animal! When the war's over, remember I told you I'd fix you up with Betty Grable!
Yeah? How you going to fix me up with Betty Grable?
How? We go to California. I got a cousin that's working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. That's how we get the address, see? Isn't that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say, 'Congratulations, Miss Grable. We have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with, and I'm here to present the
What's the award?
What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
Me? What if she don't want me?
If she don't want you, she don't get anything.
You're teasing me again!
No, Animal.
No?
Easy, Animal! Easy!
Don't you remember, Animal? A chicken lays those things.
Thanks. You're a real pal! What're we goin' to do with it?
Ain't that too bad! Tomorrow he'll have to suck a raw egg!
Wunderbar! Isn't he wunderbar!
Equipoise! Equipoise! What did I tell you, Animal?
Schnickelfritz! I told you Schnickelfritz! Why'd you make me bet on Equipoise!
I clocked him this morning. He was running like a doll.
Look at her! Isn't she beautiful! Married an orchestra leader!
So what? There's other women!
Not for me! Betty! Betty!
Cut it out. Animal! I'll fix you up with a couple of those Russian women!
You'll fix me up!
Sure, Animal! I'll get you over there!
How? Pinky Miller from Barrack 8 tried to get over there and they shot him in the leg!
It takes a gimmick, Animal, and I figured us a little gimmick.
You did?
To the Brick Kremlin!
She'll never forgive me!
Harry -- I'm blind!
What do those broads say?
What do they always say?
That's what I wanna hear.
Hey! This is with a typewriter! It's from a finance company!
So it is from the finance company. So it's better than no letter at all. So they want the third payment on the Plymouth. So they want the fourth, the fifth, the sixth and the seventh. So they want the Plymouth.
Sugar-lips Shapiro! Frightening, ain't it?
That Schulz pig. I'll get him yet.
Why don't we just look in those footlockers?
Grable, not Gable!
Do Grable.
There, Joey -- ain't that better than being a lawyer?
I'll open mine now.
Come on, Animal -- let's trip the light fantastic!
Let me alone.
You're crying, Animal.
It's that song, Harry!
You don't want to cry over a dame that doesn't even know you're alive! Snap out of it!
May I have this dance, Miss?
But it's not just those legs. It's that nose of yours I'm crazy about. That cute little button of a nose!
Hey, Animal! Animal!
I've been crazy about you for years. I've seen every picture you've ever made six times. I'd just sit there and never even open that popcorn bag.
Betty! Betty!
Let me do it, Hoffy.
You want to go?
Sergeant Hoffman from Barrack 4.
Yes, Sergeant Hoffman?
As the duly elected Compound Chief, I protest the way these bodies are left lying in the mud.
Anything else?
Yes. According to the Geneva Convention, dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial.
Good evening, Sergeants. A bit dank in here, isn't it?... Where is the Baracken-Fuehrer?
Yes, sir.
...a Lieutenant James Dunbar?
Wait a minute. We have some rights here. Why is this man being taken out?
Look -- if you don't like the way I'm handling this job --
Don't worry. We'll take care of it.
You're wasting your time, Duke. Outside, everybody! Let's get it over with.
Not yet.
Cut the horseplay, Harry. What's the matter with you guys?
It's not Schulz. It's that stoolie. Whoever he is, he's sure batting a thousand.
What are you going to do?
I don't know what your scheme is, but it sounds crazy.
Maybe it's crazy, but it's better than having Dunbar dead.
Just as you say, Hoffy. But wouldn't it be smarter if I went out and kept Schulz tied up?
What about Schulz?
No volunteers, Price. I said we're all in on it.
We've all done a poor job of it.
I still say this is my tag. Any objections, Hoffy?
What do you say, Hoffy. We'll hit the air raid trenches and cut out in back of Barracks nine.
You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
Why the south latrine?
Los, los. Dummkopf!
Lay off, Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank.
Sometimes I think he is fooling us with that crazy business.
We know! We got them last year. Five minutes after the Geneva Man was gone, the blankets were gone.
One more thing, gentlemen. The Kommandant told me to pick up the radio.
What radio?
You must get out. For your own good, you must get out.
Stay out of it, Sefton.
Anybody call?
If I were you, Sefton, I'd eat that egg some place else. Like for instance under the barrack.
If you can't get the BBC, how about getting Guy Lombardo?
What's the big idea, Sefton? Take that telescope out of here.
Says who?
Says me.
You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands.
Lay off, Sefton.
With your mother's pull, how come you're not a chicken colonel by now?
What's the matter, boys? Is my slip showing?
I'll say it is. You spilled a little borscht on it.
What happened, Cookie? Who did it?
We did it.
What's it add up to you, Sefton?
You heard that, Sefton?
You'll stay in this barracks and not a peep out of you.
Okay, then. Put a guard on me. I want you to put a guard on me. Because if anything goes wrong out there, this time you won't have a patsy. Right?
Right.
So who stays with me? Maybe Joey? No -- not Joey. Wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job?
Two packs of cigarettes say Dunbar never gets out of the compound.
You starting that again?
Hurry up on that trap. What are you trying to do, Sefton? Gum up the works?
That's right. Or would you rather see Dunbar lying out there in the mud tomorrow morning like Manfredi and Johnson?
Look, Sefton, I had my hands full so they wouldn't tear you apart --
How do they know?
You told them, Hoffy.
Who did?
You did!
You off your rocker?
Go on.
What are we going to do with him?
You taking Dunbar?
I told you boys I'm no escape artist, but for the first time, I like the odds. Because now I got me a decoy.
What's the decoy?
Price. When I go I want you to give me five minutes. Exactly five minutes to get Dunbar out of that water tank. Then you throw Price out into the compound, nice and loud. He'll draw every light from every goon tower. It's our only chance to cut through. What do you say, Barracks' Chief?
You could use a new one yourself.
Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
Today's Camp News! Father Murray announces that due to local regulations the Christmas midnight Mass will be held at seven in the morning!
You can tell Father Murray to --
Pirelli. Coleman. Agnew. Shapiro.
Nothing for Kuzawa?
Shapiro. Shapiro.
Yeah?
Give this to Joey, will you?
Now you've done it. You've given me nervous indigestion. Anything else bothering you, boys?
Just one little thing. How come you were so sure Manfredi and Johnson wouldn't get out of the forest?
And what's that crack supposed to mean?
They're lying dead in the mud out there and I'm trying to find out how come.
When the Krauts find that gadget they'll throw us all in the boob.
So was the radio private property. So was Manfredi and Johnson.
Or how about a game of pinochle? No, you're not a pinochle man. You're a chess player. I haven't played since I was a kid. Let's see -- -- a pawn moves this way, doesn't it? And a bishop this way? And the queen -- every which way, doesn't it?
Suppose you just sit down and keep your mouth shut.
I went to school with a guy named Price. But that was in Boston. You're from Cleveland, aren't you.
Yes, I'm from Cleveland.
I thought that's what you said. You're from Cleveland. And you were with the Thirty-sixth Bomb Group?
Thirty-fifth.
Three hundred and sixty-fifth Bomb Squadron? Out of Chelveston?
Are you questioning me?
Just getting acquainted. Trying to make one friend in this barracks.
Don't bother, Sefton. I don't like you. I never did and I never will.
Ach so!
What did you say?
Stop that, will you! Those idiots! So they sprang Dunbar! So what good is it? He's still in the compound, isn't he? How long can he last? Where can they hide him?
Are we going to stand around here and listen to him until the Germans find out where Dunbar is?
No. I don't sprechen sie deutsch.
Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you're kaput, Price.
Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go?
Go where? To the Kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is?
I'll kill you for that!
Shut up! Security Officer, eh? Screening everybody, only who screened you? Great American hero. From Cleveland, Ohio! Enlisted right after Pearl Harbor! When was Pearl Harbor, Price? Or, don't you know?
December seventh, forty-one.
What time?
Six o'clock. I was having dinner.
The what?
Say, Schulz -- you guys had machine gun practice last night?
Let us see. We have now two empty bunks here. Nummer einundsiebzig und Nummer dreiundsiebzig in Baracke vier.
Suppose you let those mattresses cool off a little -- just out of decency?
Which one of us is the informer?
Schulz, you're off your nut!
Give me the radio.
We have no radio.
Nun? Was ist? Haben Sie's herausgefunden?
Ich weiss alles.
Wie hat er's gemacht?
Good morning, Sefton.
Good morning, Schulz. And how's Mrs. Schulz? And all the little Schulzes?
No use, Schulz. You might as well come clean. Why don't you just tell 'em it's me. Because I'm really the illegitimate son of Hitler. And after the Germans win the war you'll make me the Gauleiter of Zinzinnati.
Du lieber Gott! How do you look? You had a fight?
How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?
You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can -- Silk stockings?
Wunderbar! Maybe they are too wunderbar for my wife. But there is a piano teacher in the village --
Three hundred cigarettes! What is it you want from me?
Who's the guy, Schulz?
What guy?
The one you work with. Who is he? How do you do it?
I do not want those cigarettes.
I'll make it five hundred!
You'd better talk, Schulz, because I'm going to find out with you or without you. Because I won't let go for a second. Because they'll have to kill me to stop me. So talk!
Talk what? I do not know anything!
What's the matter with you? You want to be killed?
Hey, Schulz -- as long as you're going to move somebody in -- how about a couple of those Russian broads?
Just get us a couple with big Glockenspiels.
Did I interrupt something, gentlemen?
Yeah. We were just passing out guns.
This is me in Cincinnati.
Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
That is my wife.
Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!
All right, gentlemen! We will now all go outside for a little gymnastic and take some shovels and undig the tunnel which you digged.
Why don't we just plug up that tunnel -- with the Kommandant on one end and you on the other.
Gentlemen, tomorrow morning the Geneva Man is coming to inspect the camp whether we are living up to the International Convention. I am sure he will find we are treating you very well. You must not run around in your underwear. And take off the wash. The Kommandant wants all the barracks to be spic and also span.
We'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.
My grandmother's ear-muffs.
From a chicken, bug-wit.
Is it all right if we smell it?
That wouldn't be the cigarettes you took us for last night?
You must have been some tail gunner! Go ahead, Cookie.
Have a nice time over there?
So you're stuck with me, eh?
You heard him.
You're not disposing of those Russian broads?
Toh-pak-cha=8A
The Captain would make a much more valuable hostage.
It's working.
I thought he was the Chief Engineer.
He is.
Where is he now?
Target their Bridge.
Actually, Captain, your precise target area was thirty-five meters that way.
Tomorrow I want to make a tri-elliptical jump. That's where you jump out over Northern China and make three complete orbits before you start re-entry.
Captain=8A
But that wasn't so long ago. It couldn't have been more than...
Twelve years, sir.
According to our information, the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through our galaxy every 39.1 years
Data?
Guinan said Soran was trying to get back to the ribbon. If that's true, then there must be some connection with the Amargosa star.
The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.
Give me a list of those effects. I want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed, no matter how insignificant.
Data, are you all right?
No, sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.
What do you mean?
Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. It's something we all have to learn to deal with.
But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend. Does that make me a coward?
No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.
According to our current information, the destruction of the Amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector: gamma emissions have increased by .05 percent, the starship Bozeman was forced to make a course correction, a research project on Gorik IV was halted due to increased neutrino particles, ambient magnetic fields have decreased by-
Wait. The Bozeman,why did it change course?
This is its current position.
Courage is an emotion too, Data. Now, can you project the course of the ribbon?
Now, you said the gravitational forces in this sector have been altered, could that also affect the course of the ribbon?
He can't go to the ribbon, so he's trying to make the ribbon come to him. Data, is it going to pass near any M-Class planets?
That's where he's going.
It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa.
Are any of them inhabited?
Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.
Population?
"Lifeforms tiny little lifeforms. Where are the lifeforms-"
Commander.
Approximately forty-seven minutes, sir.
Is she still angry?
No, but I'd stay out of Sickbay for a while if I were you. I still don't know why you dropped her in the water.
Data, you're not thinking about using that thing are you?
It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
Wait a minute. I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.
But at the first sign of trouble, I'm going to deactivate it. Agreed?
Well?
I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.
Really? What do you feel?
I get it. I get it.
What?
During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punchline.
The Farpoint mission? Data, that was seven years ago.
I know. I just got it. It was very funny.
I don't see a control panel, or an access port.
Data, this isn't the time.
Data, are you all right?
I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.
That's it, Bridge- we're all out!
Sensors show five life signs aboard the station, Captain.
Looks like you're stuck with emotions for a while. How do you feel?
I am quite...preoccupied with concern about Geordi.
We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back.
Could we access the defective coil and trigger their cloak?
I have rerouted auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters- attempting to level our descent.
Can you locate them?
The ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5. Distance: three light years.
We're within visual range of the energy distortion, Captain.
We're within range, sir.
Deck 15, section 21-alpha.
You did it, Kirk! Damage report, Ensign.
Do you remember him?
Guinan. It's important that you tell me what you know. We think Soran's developed a weapon...a terrible weapon. It might give him enough power to-
Soran doesn't care about power or weapons. All he cares about is getting back to the Nexus.
That ribbon isn't just some random energy phenomenon travelling through space. It's a doorway. It leads to another place- the Nexus. It doesn't exist in our universe and it doesn't play by the same rules either.
What happened to you?
It took a long time, but eventually I learned to live with it. And I began to realize that my experience in the Nexus had changed me. I knew things about people, about events, about time.
Your "sixth sense"- I've always wondered where it came from. And what about Soran?
Soran may still be obsessed with getting back. And if he is, he'll do anything to find that doorway again.
Guinan, what's going on? Where am I?
This is the Nexus?
For you. This is where you wanted to be.
But I never had a wife, children, a home like this.
Guinan, what are you doing here? I thought you were on the Enterprise.
I am on the Enterprise. I am also here. Think of me as an "echo" of the person you know. A part she left behind.
Left behind?
When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.
Soran?
All of us.
Where is he now?
These are my children...my children.
Guinan, can I leave the Nexus?
Why would you want to leave?
Can I?
Yes, where would you go?
I don't understand.
I know exactly where I want to go, and when. Back to that mountaintop on Veridian III, before Soran put out the star. I have to stop him.
What makes you think things will be any different this time?
You're right. I'll need help. Guinan, will you come back with me? Together, we could-
I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
Well, may we have a look around?
Excuse me, gentlemen, if you'll take your seats.
Prepare to leave spacedock. Aft thrusters ahead one quarter, port and starboard at station keeping. Captain Kirk, I'd be honored if you would give the order to get underway.
No, no. Thank you.
We don't have a tractor beam.
You left spacedock without a tractor beam?
What about the gravimetric distortions? They'll tear us apart.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
This clock, I gave this clock to Bones.
So you're telling me this is the 24th-century, and I'm dead?
Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of-
You said history considers me dead. Who am I to argue with history?
You're a Starfleet officer and you have a duty to-
No, no, it's not. It's better.
Better?
Antonia?
Captain of the Enterprise, huh?
That's right.
Close to retirement?
How can I argue with the captain of the Enterprise? What was the name of that planet=8A Veridian III?
That's right.
I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?
You could say that.
I'll find a way to contact the Enterprise. You're going to be all right.
Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
Yes. Thank you.
Oh
I'm not going Scotty, help me with this chute.
What do you mean, you're not going? We promised.
You know, Scotty, it amazes me.
And what would that be, sir?
Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?
Their life signs are are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum.
The first thing you learn as captain is how to cheat death. Scotty?
But I do have a theory...
I thought you might.
An anti-matter discharge directly ahead=8A it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away.
A photon torpedo?
Aye.
Captain, it may be possible to simulate a torpedo blast using a resonance burst from the main deflector dish.
Keep her together until I get back.
Kirk here.
A remarkable piece of equipment, but a little inelegant, wouldn't you say? Have you ever considered a prosthesis that would make you look a little more...normal?
What's normal?
Normal is what everyone else is, and what you are not.
I don't want a science lecture. You were on that observatory looking for trilithium. Why?
Let's try to move beyond the usual prisoner-interrogator banter, shall we? You have information and I need it. Did the Captain explain his orders to you? Did he say why you were searching for trilithium?
No.
What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
Oh, I forgot to tell you. While you were unconscious, I injected a nano-probe into your bloodstream. It's been navigating your cardiovascular system, and right now I've attached it to your left ventricle. A little trick I picked up from the Borg.
Yeah, they're full of great ideas.
I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
No, I didn't know that.
We learn something new about ourselves every day. Now. Maybe I didn't make myself clear. It is very important that you tell me exactly what Captain Picard knows.
Don't you think you're taking this a little too far, Number One?
Well, now that we're all aboard=8A Number One, bring the ship before the wind. Let's see what's out there.
Imagine what it was like, Will. No engines, no computers, just the wind, the sea and the stars to guide you.
Sir?
There's still no indication of why they attacked the station?
We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
Hmm, Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
You want me to contact Starfleet?
Is there a problem?
No, sir.
There is something else, Captain. One of the scientists, a Doctor Soran,has insisted on speaking with you. I told him you were busy, sir, but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away.
Understood. That will be all.
Sir, is there anything wrong?
Report.
A quantum implosion has occurred within the Amargosa star. All nuclearfusion is breaking down.
Maybe they're not out there.
That's a pretty big margin of error.
I always thought I'd have a crack at this chair one day.
Captain, are you all right?
Counselor. What can I do for you?
Actually, I'm here to see if there's anything I can do for you.
I'm afraid I can't just leave it at that. The commanding officer of this ship is clearly distraught about something. As ship's counselor, it's my duty to-
As ship's counselor, it's your duty to know not only when you're needed but also when you're not.
Well, with all due respect to your Betazoid senses, I prefer to be alone right now.
Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input. "Admiral Lusby, regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly irritable, remote and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to-"
Captain, Im sorry. I know there were a lot of unresolved conflicts between you and your brother.
It's only natural to feel a heightened sense of tragedy when a child dies. But it goes deeper than that, doesn't it? I can sense that Rene meant a great deal to you.
Your family history is very important to you, isn't it?
You felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line.
My brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs.
Or perhaps they're on the surface.
Doctor Soran?
Nothing for me. I understand there's something urgent you need to discuss with me.
Doctor, we're still conducting an investigation into the attack. Once we've completed our work, we'll be happy to allow you and your fellow scientists back aboard the observatory. Until then-
The timing is very important on my experiment- if it is not completed within the next twelve hours, years of research will be lost.
You must think I'm quite the madman.
The thought had crossed my mind.
I've spent eighty years looking for another way, Captain. This is the only one. Of course, you could always come with me. You fancy yourself an explorer. Here's a chance to explore something no human has ever experienced.
We're all mortal, Soran. It's one of the truths of ou existence.
What if I told you I found a new truth?
The Nexus.
Careful, Captain. That's a fifty gigawatt forcefield. I wouldn't want to see you get hurt.
The royal...studs?
It looks like we're too late.
These blast patterns are consistent with Type III disruptors.
One of the dead Romulans had a tricorder. We analyzed its sensor logs and found they were scanning for signature particles of a compound called trilithium.
Trilithium?
An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it.
Have Geordi and Data go over with the next Away Team. Tell them to scan the observatory for trilithium.
Sensor records show a solar probe was launched from the observatory a few moments ago.
I have spoken to the Klingon High Council, sir. They identified the Bird of Prey as belonging to the Duras sisters.
They have found a way to penetrate our shields.
It is a Class D-12 Bird of Prey. They were retired from service because of defective plasma coils.
Plasma coils...is there any way we can use that to our advantage?
As their cloak begins to engage, their shields will drop.
Worf, prepare a spread of photon torpedoes. We'll have to hit them the instant they begin to cloak.
Aye, sir.
Status!
All automates ready and functioning. Automatic moorings retracted. All speeds available through transwarp drive.
Enterprise maintaining full impulse power...
And we are gaining... Stand by, tractor beam!
Tractor beam, aye!
Transwarp at your command, Sir!
Steady... Steady, boys. Keep scanning... I thought you people were reliable... Where the hell is he!
He has been here for some time. I can feel his presence.
Don't give me your Klingon mumbo- jumbo -- there ain't another vessel in this whole damn quadrant.
Put me on the hailing frequency.
What's going on? When do we get paid off...?
Mr. Chekov -- ?
An energy reading from 'C" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters...
Mr. Chekov, I ordered Spock's quarters sealed!
Will we get another ship?
Shall I alert Dr. McCoy?
Unit two, this is One. The Kobayashi Maru has set sail for the promised land. Acknowledge.
Calm yourself, Bones.
Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel.
Excelsior closing to 4,000 meters, sir.
You did great, Bones... Just great.
Sir, Starfleet calling Grissom again. A warning about us.
Response?
Nothing. As before.
What's Grissom up to?... Will they join us, or fire on us...? Chekov, break radio silence. Send my compliments to Captain Esteban.
Admiral, there is no response from the Grissom on any channel.
Still no response, sir.
I'd swear something was there sir, but I might have imagined it.
What did you see, Chekov?
For an instant... A scout class vessel.
Nothing on my scanner, sir.
Sir, the shields... Non- responsive.
Aye sir, coding now.
Do you wish to advise Starfleet, sir?
Sir... Something's jamming our transmission. An energy surge.
Locate.
Surge from astern, sir. Aft quarter!
Could it be Spock's?
It has to be. Gravitational fields were in flux... It must have soft landed...!
I don't believe it...
Why don't we beam it up?
Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state: "nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated." Can you guarantee that?
All right -- get your gear. I'll put you down next time around.
Hello, sir. It's David.
David... Sorry I'm late.
It's okay -- I should have known you'd come... Saavik's right: this planet is unstable. It's going to destroy itself in a matter of hours.
David!... What went wrong?
David, I don't understand...
This is where the fun begins, Saavik!
Like your father... so human. All units functional, recorders are on... Scanning sector one. Foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty- two point two Celsius.
Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.
Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature -- Temperature decreasing rapidly --
It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!
... Fascinating.
All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
Same sector. Metallic mass.
Underground deposit?
Negative, on surface... A manufactured object.
Approximately two meters long... Cylindrical in form...
New orbit commencing... Coming up on sector three...
Short range scan.
As before... Metallic mass... Verifying triminium photon tube... No new data.
Check for trace radiation. Infrared enhancement.
There <u>shouldn't</u> be any. Only plant forms were built into the Genesis matrix.
Captain, please -- we'll take the risk. We've <u>got</u> to find out what it is...
Saavik to Grissom. Request computer study of soil samples for geological aging.
I'll handle that later.
My readings indicate great instability.
. .. Spock's tube...
Well. There's your life form reading. These were microbes on the tube's surface. We shot them here from Enterprise. They were fruitful, and multiplied.
What is it?
Later. Let's go...
Saavik... My god, what happened to them?
It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.
You mean, we're stranded down here?!
Logic indicates that is the case.
How can you be logical at a time like this?! We have to get thee hell off this planet!
That may be difficult...
Why don't you just call for <u>help</u>!
It's time for total truth between us. This planet is not what you intended, or hoped for, is it?
Not exactly.
Why?
I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix.
Protomatter. An unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable.
It was the only way to solve certain problems --
Did your collaborator know?
My mother knew nothing about it. That's why I asked her to leave Genesis in my hands.
So, like your father, you changed the rules...
If I hadn't, it might have been years -- or never!
This planet is aging in surges.
The Genesis wave started a life clock ticking for him and the planet. But at the rate things are going now...
... How long?
Days... Maybe hours... Protomatter has made the situation unpredictable. I'm sorry.
It will be hardest on Spock. Soon he will feel the burning of his Vulcan blood.
I don't understand.
Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
Whoever they are, they're getting closer.
I'll go...
If equipment is functioning properly, indications are -- an animal life form.
Captain... the logical alternative is obvious... beaming down to the surface is permitted...
Grissom to landing party. We have you approaching radioactive indications. Do you concur?
Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.
Very well. Exercise caution, Lieutenant. This landing is Captain's discretion and I'm the one who's out on a limb.
Captain, this is Saavik. We have strong life sign readings bearing zero-one-five relative, and we are proceeding to investigate.
We concur, Saavik. And Saavik... be advised we are reading a severe and unnatural age curve on the planet. I'm getting nervous...
Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please...
Ah, Saavik, that's, ah, extroadinary. What would you, ah, like to do next?
Request permission to beam aboard immediately.
Saavik... Does Dr. Marcus think there could be -- any chance of -- ah -- radioactive contamination?
None that I can detect, sir.
I'm sure Starfleet would approve, sir.
Captain, what's happening?!
I'm almost done, sir. You'll be fully automated by the time we dock.
Your timing is excellent, Mr. Scott. You've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. How much refit time till we can take her out again?
Eight weeks, sir. But you don't have eight weeks so I'll do it for ya in two.
Mr. Scott. Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?
Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
Mr. Scott...
I'm sorry, sir, but as far as I'm concerned, there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have.
As promised, she's all yours, sir. All systems automated and ready. A chimpanzee and two trainees could run her.
Mr. Scott?
I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.
Steady... Steady... All right, Mr. Scott.
Sir...?
Aye, sir, she's got her second wind now.
Mr. Scott, all power to the weapons systems --
Mr. Scott: two photon torpedoes at the ready. Sight on the center of the mass.
Good shooting, Scotty.
Aye, those two hits should stop a horse, let alone a bird.
I'm all right -- stand by to return fire! Mr. Scott, transfer power to the phaser banks --
Oh, God, sir, I dinna think so...
What's wrong?
How many more?
Just him, sir!
Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.
Saavik... Is... David with you?
Yes, he is. And someone else. Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.
This Vulcan -- is he alive?
What happened...?
Is there <U>anything</U> we can do?!
The Genesis planet is gone.
Yes, Admiral. But that may not be possible.
What? What are you saying?
The Katra ritual is meant to deposit Spock's consciousness in the Hall of Ancient Thought - not in his body.
But we have Spock alive! That's more than we bargained for!
Or less. What you describe is called Fal Tor Pan - the refusion. It is very dangerous. The elders may not choose to attempt it.
And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?
My God...
I know you... Do I not?
Yes. And I know you.
My father says you have been my friend... You came back for me.
You would have done the same for me.
Why would you do this...?
Yes, yes, Spock...
The ship... Out of danger...?
On course, Admiral. Estimating Spacedock in two point one hours.
... Admiral, what's going to happen to Enterprise?
The word, sir?
The word is no. I am therefore going anyway.
Count on our help, sir.
... We have cleared Spacedoors.
Warp Speed, Mr. Sulu...
Excelsior, the great experiment, is adrift in space.
Estimating Genesis 2.9 hours, present speed.
We are secured from Warp Speed... Now entering Genesis Sector of Mutara Quadrant.
See! That shimmering area.
That distortion is closing rapidly... Opinion, Sulu?
I think it's an energy form, sir...
Yes. Enough energy to hide a ship, wouldn't you say?
... A cloaking device?
Klingon Bird of Prey, sir! She's arming torpedoes...!
Mr. Sulu, what is the crew complement of a Bird of Prey?
About a dozen officers and men.
Sir, planet core readings unstable... Changing rapidly...
What about surface life signs...?
Close... There --
If I read this right, sir, we have full power.
We are clear and free to navigate.
The planet Vulcan. In hailing distance, sir.
Mr. Sulu, you're on manual.
Uhura, any response from Starfleet on our Project Genesis inquiries?
No, sir, no response.
Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.
Would you look at that?
How is Doctor McCoy, sir?
Gentlemen. Good evening.
Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?
Will you be able to handle that...?
Welcome aboard, Admiral.
Where's Doctor McCoy?
Indisposed, sir.
Admiral, I don't understand. The Enterprise --
Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We think her day is over...
But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
Genesis?! Whatever for?
Why -- a natural desire to help finish the work we began!
That's out of the question. No one is going to Genesis!
May I ask why...?
Jim... You are my best officer and if I had a best friend, you'd be that too. But I am Commander, Starfleet, so I don't break rules!
Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage --
Now wait a minute! This business about Spock and McCoy... Honestly, I have never understood Vulcan mysticism -- I'm sorry! But part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself... Understand?
Harry, you don't have to believe! I'm not even sure I believe. But if there's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility.
Yours...?!
As surely as if it were my own! Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help...
No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding.
Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship.
Out of the question! The Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis!
Yes... I hear you. I just had to try.
Of course... Now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away.
You're right. Thanks for the drink.
I say again: Grissom, this is Enterprise. Admiral Kirk calling Captain Esteban or Lieutenant Saavik. Come in!

Do not lecture me about treaty violations. The Federation, in creating an ultimate weapon, has become a gang of Intergalactic criminals. It is not I who will surrender, it is you. On the planet below, I have three prisoners from the team who developed your doomsday weapon. If you do not surrender immediately, I will execute them, one at a time, as enemies of
Who is this?! How dare you --
David?... David!
Admiral, your young friend is mistaken. I meant what I said. And now, to show my intentions are sincere... I am going to kill one of the prisoners.
Wait! Give me a chance --
There are two more prisoners, Admiral. Do you want them killed too? Surrender your vessel!
Commander, Klingon vessel. Stand by to board this ship on my next signal.
No tricks, Kirk. You have one minute.
Maltz. Prisoners are at beam coordinates. Standby...
You should take the Vulcan, too.
No.
But, why?
Genesis, I want it.
Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk.
Give me what I want -- and I'll consider it...
You fool -- look around you! This planet is destroying itself!
Yes. Exhilarating, isn't it!
If we don't help each other, we'll all die here!
Give me your hand and we both live.

Ambassador, I -- I had no idea you were here... I think you know my crew...
Sarek... I would have come to Vulcan... to express my deepest sympathies...
Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.
Then you know how bravely your son met his death.
"Met his death"? How could you, his friend, have assumed that? Why did you leave him on Genesis! Spock trusted you -- and you denied him his future!
I -- saw no future --
You missed the point, then and now... Only his body was "in death," Kirk! And you were the last one to be with him.
Yes, I was...
Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.
But -- why?
Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.
Sir. Your son meant more to me than you can know. I'd have given my life if it would have saved his. You must believe me when I tell you that he made no request of me!
He would not have spoken of it openly.
Then, how --
Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind?
... He spoke of your friendship.
Yes...
He asked you not to grieve...
... Yes...
... The needs of the many outweigh...
... The needs of the few...
... Or the one.
... Spock...
I have been... and always shall be... your friend. Live long... and prosper!
... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.
Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body's end is near.
But he couldn't touch me...! We were separated!
Please wait!... Surely he would have found a way! If there was so much at stake -- Spock would have found a way!
Yes... But -- how...?
Bones!...
One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.
What must I do?
You must bring them to Mount Selaya -- on Vulcan. Only there is the passage possible. Only there can both find peace...
What you ask is difficult.
What about Spock?
I am not sure. Only time will answer. Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is --
What I have done, I had to do.
But at what cost? Your ship... Your son.
So! Speak!
Share this with no one.
Understood, my lord.
We are going to this "planet." Even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the Federation, we will <U>act</U> for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!
Success, my lord.
Sir, may I suggest --
Say the wrong thing, Torg, and I will kill you too!
I ordered no interruptions.
We are cloaked. Enemy closing on impulse power. Range, 5,000 Kellicams.
Why haven't they finished us?... They outgun me ten to one; they have four hundred in crew to my handful, yet they sit there.
Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner.
How can you tell that?
I give two minutes. For you, and your gallant crew. Take every last man: form a boarding party, armed heavily!
They outnumber us, my Lord --
I'll be in my quarters. Execute course to the Federation Boundary.
Range: 3000 Kellicams.
Firing range, sir.
1,000 Kellicams, closing!
500 Kellicams!
My Lord, enemy commander wishes a truce to confer.
My Lord... what are your orders?
I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
Sir, may I --
Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --
They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
But surely, our mission has not failed -- ?
You amaze me, Commander.
How is that...?
A twenty year space veteran, yet you ask for the worst duty station in town. I mean, look at this place: the hind end of space.
Peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant.
Well, maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down. But me: I need some challenge in my life. Some adventure... Even just a surprise or two.
Commander, these are some of the most famous people in Starfleet! Admiral Kirk, my God!
Good for you, Lieutenant.
But it's damn irregular. No destination orders, no encoded i.d...
All true.
Well -- what are we going to do about it?!
I am going to do nothing about it. <u>You</u> are going to sit in the closet.
The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all sense of reality?
But dear Lord, are we intelligent enough to -- Suppose, this thing were used where life already exists?
It would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix --
It's new -- have you any idea what you're saying?
I was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications, Doctor. As a matter of cosmic history, it has always been easier to destroy than to create --
Not anymore! Now you can do both at the same time! According to myth, the earth was created in six days. Watch out: here comes Genesis; we'll do it for you in six minutes --
I don't dispute that in the wrong hands --
Are you out of your Vulcan mind? No human can tolerate the radiation loose in there!
But, as you are so fond of observing, Doctor, I'm not human.
You're not going in there -- !
Physician, heal thyself.
That's all you have to say?
Wouldn't it be easier to put an experienced crew back on the ship?
Bless me, doctor; and what beams you into this neck of the woods?
Romulan Ale! Bones, you know this stuff is illegal --
I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring...
Twenty-two, eighty-three...
I'm almost afraid to. What did you bring me, contraband Klingon --
Cheers. Bones, these are... charming.
Four hundred years old. You don't find many with the lens still intact.
Uh -- what are they?
For your eyes. For most patients of your age, I generally administer Retlax Five to restore flexibility of the lens.
But I'm allergic to Retlax.
Slide them down your nose. Now look at me over the top. And you read printed matter through the bottom.
Amazing! I don't know what to say --
Say thank you.
Damn it, Jim, what the hell's the matter? Other people have birthdays. Why're we treating yours like a funeral?
Bones, I don't want to be lectured.
What DO you want? Damn it, why isn't there a girl here? You know this has nothing to do with age. This is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you wanna be out hopping Galaxies.
Spare me your notions of poetry, please. We all have our assigned duties and...
Bull. You're hiding -- hiding behind the rules and regulations --
And who am I hiding from?
Don't mince words, Bones; tell me what you really think.
Shore leave, Admiral.
What about the rest of the inspection, Admiral?
It never rains but when it pours --
I've got the sick bay ready. Will someone please tell me what is going on?
Doctors lose patients sometimes. Damn. I'm <u>still</u> in the dark: How'd he know about Genesis?
At the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it. You said it yourself; we're talking about a bang that would re-arrange the universe...
There may still be time... you gave as good as you got.
Khan could be down there!
He's BEEN there and hasn't found what he wants. Can you spare someone? There may be people hurt.
They even killed the galley chief.
Go? <u>Where</u> are we going?
But what if they went -- nowhere?
Do you have anything to eat? I don't know about anyone else, but I'm starved.
How can you think of food at a time like this?
Now that's what I call a meal.
Lieutenant, you are looking at the only Starfleet cadet who ever beat the no-win scenario --
Until now.
Hours instead of days, Saavik; now we have minutes instead of hours --
You okay, Jim? How do you feel?
... come in, please. This is Reliant calling Regula I. Repeat. This is USS Reliant --
Commander, we are receiving. This is Regula I. Go ahead.
Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route to you and should be there in three days.
En route? Why? We weren't expecting you for another three months. Has something happened? <u>Has something happened</u>? Do you read us?
I still don't under --
<u>Will you please be quiet</u>! Commander Chekov, this is completely irregular. Who gave the order you are quoting? Who gave the order?
The order comes from Starfleet command, Dr. Marcus, direct from the General Staff.
But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control --
This is completely improper, Commander Chekov. I have no intention of allowing Reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials.
Jim... read me? Can you read me?
Message breaking up, Carol. What's wrong? What's wrong?
... Can't read you... repeat...
Repeat... what's wrong? What's wrong?
... taking Genesis away from us...
Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking Genesis?
... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...?
What order? Who's taking Genesis?
... Please help us, Jim... won't let them have... without proper... repeat... on whose authority...
Carol!
Wait --
David was right, wasn't he? It's just to keep them busy.
Why? Why didn't you tell me?
You did this -- in a day?!
It is a far far better thing I do than I have ever done before... a far better resting place I go to than I have ever known...
Is that a poem?
How can you let them pull that stuff on you? They're just lazy.
And bored. I know. But maybe it IS something they can...
Come on, Mother, that's just the military mentality. Never put off tomorrow what you can put off today. If there's one atom of life...
Well, don't have kittens. Genesis is going to work. They'll remember you in a wreath with Newton, Einstein, Surak...
Thanks a lot. No respect from my offspring --
Par for the course... you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner?
Maybe...
Does that about do it?
I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one.
Will you please be quiet! We must have order here. This has to be some sort of mistake.
I've tried to warn you. Scientists are always pawns of the military --
David --
Jim --
Go back. I'm going to kill him.
So are we, it looks like.
This? It took the Starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this. What we did in there -- we did in a day. David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy and the Lieutenant our idea of food.
David. Please.
Don't tell me you've got something.
We've picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner.
Damn! Are you sure? Maybe the scanner's out of adjustment --
I suppose it <u>could</u> be a particle of preanimate matter caught in the matrix...
All right, let's get on the Comm-pic to Doctor Marcus. Maybe it's something we can transplant.
Are you sure these are the coordinates?
Captain, this is the garden spot of Ceti Alpha VI --
You're crazy -- !
I saw it -- !
I told you! I told you I saw a --
<u>Botany Bay</u> -- oh no!
But the child --
A criminal, Captain -- a product of the late 20th Century genetic engineering --
He left us. We were no longer of use. SAAVIK Where is the Reliant crew? Dead?
You lie! On Ceti Alpha V there was life, a fair chance to --
<u>This is Ceti Alpha V</u>! Ceti Alpha VI exploded six months after we were left here. The shock shifted the orbit of <u>this</u> planet and everything was laid waste. <u>Admiral</u> Kirk never bothered to check on our progress. It was only the fact of my genetically engineered intellect that enabled us to survive! On earth, two hundred years ago, I was a prince, with
Captain Kirk was your host! You repaid his hospitality by trying to steal his ship and murder him.
Khan, listen to me! Captain Kirk was only doing his duty! You --
Beyond what I told you, sir, it is classified information.
Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information?
I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.
Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
To Doctor Marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula I.
Well done, Commander.
I'm Admiral Kirk...
Where's Dr. Marcus --
Why didn't you tell me?
It's a long story.
It's the Genesis Wave!
What?
He's on a build up to detonation!
How soon --
We encoded four minutes --
We'll beam aboard and stop it --
I don't mean to intrude.
Uh, no... I should be on the bridge.
I suppose I was. I poured a drink. Would you like it?
No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.
I didn't expect anything.
That makes two of us. Lieutenant Saavik was right: you never have faced death --
Not like this -- no. I haven't faced death, I cheated death. I tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity. I know nothing.
You knew enough to tell Saavik that how we face death is at least as important as how we face life --
It was just words.
But good words. That's where ideas begin. Maybe you should listen to them.
I'm trying, David.
So am I. My friends were killed, too.
I was wrong about you. And <u>I'm</u> sorry.
Is that what you came here to say?
Let go -- he can't -- !
What are you looking at?
The Admiral's son.
Don't you believe it.
What are <u>you</u> looking at?
Steady on course. All systems normal.
They're requesting visual communications, sir.
Let them eat static.
They're still running with shields down.
Careful: Not all at once. <u>The</u> <u>engine room</u>. Lock on target and prepare to fire.
Sir -- our shields are dropping!
They won't --
At them! At them! FIRE! FIRE! Why can't you?
We can't fire, sir; they've damaged the photon controls and the warp drive. We must withdraw!
No!
Well?
Departing dark side, Regula.
We'll lose them if they go in there.
No sir! We have Genesis -- Whatever you want --
Tactical!
Inoperative.
Yours... is... the superior...
You still remember, Admiral. I cannot help but be touched. Of course, I remember you.
What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant?
-- But I wanted you to know first who it was who had beaten you: I, Khan Noonian Singh, the eagle you attempted to cage forever.
Khan, listen to me -- if its me you want, I'll have myself beamed aboard. All I ask is that you spare my crew.
Genesis, what's that?
Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --
Give me some time to recall the data on our computers --
Thirty seconds...
Khan, how do I know you'll keep your word?
I've given you no word to keep, Admiral. In my judgment, you simply have no alternative.
Time's up, Admiral...
Kirk! Kirk, you are still alive -- my old friend...
Still, 'old friend.' You've managed to kill just about everyone else, but like a poor marksman, you keep missing the target.
Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't count on Enterprise. She can't move. My next act will be to blow her out of the heavens.
I don't know you. But you. I never forget a face. Mister Chekov, isn't it? I never thought to see your face again.
You are in a position to demand nothing, sir. I, on the other hand, am in a position to grant nothing. What you see is all that remains of the ship's company and the crew of the <u>Botany Bay</u>, marooned here fifteen years ago by Captain James T. Kirk.
Listen to me -- you men and women --
Save your strength, Captain, these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born. Do you mean he... ... never told you the tale? To amuse you, Captain? Never told you how the <u>Enterprise</u> picked up the <u>Botany Bay</u>, lost in space from the year 1996, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze?
I've never even met Admiral Kirk --
Captain... We're waiting. What's the delay?
All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis...
An emergency situation has arisen. By order of Starfleet Command, as of now, 1800 hours, I am assuming command of this vessel. Duty officer so note in the ship's log. Plot a new course: for Space Laboratory Regula I. Mr. Scott?
Aye, sir.
We'll be going to warp speed --
Scotty -- what's left?
Just the batteries, sir. I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes --
We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power?
Just barely, sir.
I'll need ten minutes, sir, 'til the radiation dissipates.
Uhura. Can't you augment?
She's not responding...
Try the emergency channels...
Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.
I'm getting a voice message... wait ... short range band. They say their Chambers coil is shorting their COMM system.
Mr. Scott on discrete.
On screen.
Admiral --
... No response, sir.
Saavik, for God's sake, tell her we're all right.
Enterprise to Reliant: you are ordered to surrender your vessel. Respond! Nothing, sir.
Mr. Scott, you old space dog. You're well?
I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy pulled me through.
Midshipman, you're a tiger.
My sister's youngest, Admiral. Crazy to get to space.
Every young boy's fancy. I seem to remember it myself. Very well. Mr. Scott, are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise?
Give the word, Admiral.
Mr. Scott, the word is given.
<u>WHY</u>?
The energizer's bypassed like a Christmas tree -- so don't give me too many bumps.
Admiral, I've got to take the mains off the line. The energizer's shaken loose and I can't get in there to fix her -- radiation --
No, sir! You'll flood the whole compartment...!
If he hadn't, we'd be space by now.
Yes, Spock.
Engine room reports auxiliary power restored. We can proceed at impulse power.
Kirk to Enterprise. Damage report, Spock?
Admiral, if we go by the book, like Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem like days.
Meaning you can't even beam us back?
Spock, this is Kirk. It's two hours. Are you about ready?
And who is this?
Your first training voyage, Mr. Preston?
Yes, SIR.
I believe you'll find everything shipshape, Admiral.
Oh do you? Have you any idea, Midshipman Preston, how many times I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on the Comm, telling me his troubles? Have you any idea the ribbing I've had to endure in the officers' mess to the effect that the Enterprise is a flying death trap?
Is the word given?
The word is given: warp speed.
I assume you are loitering here to learn what efficiency rating I plan to give your cadets.
They destroyed the simulator room and you with it.
The <u>Kobayshi Maru</u> scenario frequently wreaks havoc with students and equipment. As I recall you took the test three times yourself. Your final solution was, shall we say, unique?
It had the virtue of never having been tried.
Yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a Vulcan mentality.
So you said at the time. Speaking of which, your protg's first rare -- a trifle emotional --
She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example.
I know of your fondness for antiques.
'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
Hrummm... and where are you off to, now?
The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you?
Permission to come aboard, Captain?
Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you.
There's a first time for everything, Admiral.
Something may be wrong at Regula I. We've been ordered to investigate.
Regula I is a scientific research laboratory, if memory serves...
I told Starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but we're the only ship in the quadrant. Spock: those cadets of yours -- how good are they? How will they respond under real pressure?
Like all living beings, Admiral each according to his gifts. The ship is yours.
That won't be necessary: just take me to Regula I.
Excuse my presumption, but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command.
But it may be nothing; garbled communications. Why don't you...
You are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions.
I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well. Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material.
I would not presume to debate you.
That is wise. In any case, were I to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
Will you accompany me to the bridge?
There are two possibilities, sir they are unwilling to respond, they are unable to respond.
How far?
Twelve hours and forty-three minutes, present speed.
Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom?
Carol Marcus --
It literally is Genesis...
The power of creation --
Have they proceeded with their experiments?
Gentlemen, this isn't --
What's she doing here?
Is it possible their COMM system has failed -- ?
Their coil emissions are normal... Wait: their shields are going up. They're locking phasers -- !
They knew just where to hit us.
WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And <u>why</u>?
One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.
Visual! Mr. Sulu, divert everything to the phasers --
Not enough against their shields.
Admiral, you can't give him Genesis...
The prefix code?
You've got to learn WHY things work on a Starship. It's coming through now, Khan...
Let's hope he hasn't changed the combination. He's quite intelligent...
Scanners and sensors still inoperative. There's no way to tell what's inside the station.
And no way of knowing if Reliant is still in the area...
Affirmative, Admiral.
... Blind as a Tiberian Bat. What do you make of the plantoid beyond?
Regula is class "D'. It consists of various remarkable ores. Essentially, a great rock in space.
Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.
A distinct possibility.
All right, join the party. Mr. Spock, the ship is yours.
Aye sir --
Establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you've talked with Mr. Scott.
What IS working around here?
Not much, Admiral. We have partial main power...
That's it?
Uh oh.
She can out-run us and out-gun us. But there is the Mutara Nebula at 153 mark four.
I think we can guarantee she'll follow us, Mr. Saavik. Remind me to explain to you the concept of human ego.
Estimating nebula penetration in two minutes. Reliant is closing.
Admiral, they're reducing speed.
Sporadic energy readings port side, aft. Could be an impulse turn.
He won't break off now. If he followed me this far he'll be back. But from where...?
Spock!
The ship -- out of danger?
... the good of the few...
I never took the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u> test -- until now. What do you think of my solution?
Spock...!
Kirk here.
I have an urgent CommPic from Space Lab Regula I for the Admiral. Dr. Carol Marcus.
In my quarters, Uhura.
Uhura! What's happening? Damn it...
Transmission jammed at the source, sir.
Captain Spock, if you do not hear from us within <u>one hour</u> your orders are to restore what power you can, take the Enterprise to the nearest Star Base and alert Starfleet command when you are out of jamming range.
Sir -- we won't leave you behind...!
Any suggestions, Admiral?
Well, Mr. Saavik, are you going to stay with the sinking ship?
Permission to speak candidly, sir?
Very well.
I don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities.
And why not?
Because... there was no way to win.
A no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face. Has that never occurred to you?
... No, sir. It has not.
How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life, wouldn't you say?
As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.
Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently?
May I speak, sir?
Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.
I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating.
You earned it.
I did not think so.
You're bothered by your performance on the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>.
I failed to resolve the situation.
There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character.
May I ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?
That was a little joke.
Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...
Yes.
This is damned peculiar. Yellow alert.
Khan!
Reliant's command...
On screen...
Begging the Admiral's pardon: General Order 15: 'No flag officer shall beam into a hazardous area without armed escort.'
Indeterminate life signs.
That's true, Admiral. All the memory cells have been emptied.
It doesn't make sense. These coordinates are well within Regula -- a plantoid we know to be lifeless and airless.
If Stage Two was completed, it was underground -- she said it was going to be underground.
Admiral?
What's on your mind, Lieutenant?
Are you asking me if we are playing out that scenario now, Lieutenant?
How?
I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship.
<u>WHAT</u>?
I changed the conditions of the test. I received a commendation for original thinking. I don't like to lose.
But the damage report -- we were immobilized...
Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions are being monitored during battle...'
That was close --
Hold your course. Look sharp...
Mr. Saavik, all stop.
All stop, sir.
Cease fire. Look sharp.
Power levels quite low, sir.
Saavik, get us out, best speed!
Time from my mark...
Two minutes, ten seconds.
Time!
Three minutes, thirty seconds.
After you dismiss the company, you will take the watch. Set course for Ceti Alpha V and we'll pick up survivors.
Aye, sir.
I'll be in my quarters if needed, but I would prefer...
Understood, sir.
Admiral on the bridge!
As you were, Mr. Saavik.
Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well.
Yes, well, why don't you show him around and...
I really must thank you.
I am delighted; any chance to go aboard Enterprise, however briefly, is always an excuse for nostalgia.
I cut your new orders personally. By the end of the month, you'll have your first command: USS EXCELSIOR.
Thank you, sir. I've looked forward to this for a long time.
Stop engines.
Course plotted for Regula I, Admiral...
Reliant in our section this quadrant, sir, and slowing --
Mr. Sulu... The shields!
I can't get power, sir!
Mr. Sulu, lock phasers on target and await my command...
Sir, you did it.
Approaching Regula and Space Lab Regula I.
Admiral on the bridge --
Phaser lock inoperative, sir.
Leaving Section Fourteen for Section Fifteen.
Project parabolic course to avoid entering Neutral Zone.
May I remind the Captain that if a Starship enters the zone --
I'm aware of my responsibilities, Mister.
Shields activated!
We're over our heads. Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.
Aft thrusters, Mr. Sulu.
We are clear and free to navigate.
Prepare for warp speed.
We commend the soul of our brother departed. We love we commit his body to the depths of space.
Fire all phasers...!
He's not what I expected, Sir.
What did you expect, Lieutenant?
He's very human.
Very well, Mr. Saavik, clear all moorings.
All moorings are clear, Captain.
Lieutenant, how many times have you piloted a Starship out of Spacedock?
Take her out, Mr. Saavik.
Sir, may I quote General Order 12: 'On the approach of any vessel, when communications have not been est --
Lieutenant, the Admiral is aware of the Regulations.
Certainly...
You lied.
I do not understand the final question...
You are half human. The Computer knows that.
The question is irrelevant.
Spock... The retraining of your mind has been in the Vulcan way, so you may not understand feelings. But as my son, you have them. They will surface.
As you wish, since you deem them of value. But I cannot wait here to find them.
Where must you go?
To Earth. To offer testimony.
You do this -- for friendship?
I do this because I was there,
Spock. Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one...?
I would accept that as an axiom.
Then you stand here alive because of a mistake -- made by your flawed, feeling, human friends. They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the <u>one</u> -- you -- was more important to them.
Humans make illogical decisions...
Heard there was some excitement.
How're you doing?
Fine. Just fine.
Don't tell me fish stories, kiddo. I've known you too long.
Bob... it's tearing me apart.
I know. I feel the same thing. But we're between a rock and a hard place. We can't keep them without risking their lives and we can't let them go without a taking the same chance.
Yeah.
And finally, they're not human beings, you know. Their intelligence has in no way been proven comparable to ours --
Sorry if I spoke out of turn.
Not at all. You gave me things to think about. You always do. You do sound a little wrecked, why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling?
You -- sent them away. Without even letting me say goodbye?
Professor Scott, I'm Dr. Nichols, plant manager. I'm terribly sorry but there's been an awful mix-up Would you believe I was never told about your visit?
Well, so much for the tour of our humble plant. I must say, Professor your knowledge of engineering is most impressive.
Back home, we call him the miracle worker.
He never jokes... Perhaps the professor could use your computer.
No! No... What did you have in mind...?
You'd think they could at least send a ship. Bad enough to be court marshaled and spend the rest of our lives mining borite -- but to come home in this Klingon flea trap...
We could learn a thing or two from this flea trap. It has a cloaking device that cost us a lot.
You sure this is such a bright idea?
What do you mean?
I mean <u>him</u>, back at his post, like nothing happened. I don't know if you'd got the whole picture but he isn't exactly working on all thrusters.
It'll come back to him.
Are you sure? That's what I thought.
Bones --
Bones, stay here.
Now wait just a damn minute.
You're really going to try this time travel in this rust bucket?
We've done it before.
Sure, slingshot around the Sun. If you pick up enough speed you're in time warp. If you don't, you fry..
I prefer a dose of common sense. you are proposing to head backwards in time, find Humpback Whales, then bring them forward in time, drop them off - and hope they tell this Probe what to do with itself!
-- That's the general idea.
That's crazy!
It doesn't look all that different.
Oh, joy.
Jim, you've got to let me go in there! Don't leave him in the hands of Twentieth Century medicine.
What did you say she was getting?
An experimental device, doctor.
Wake up, man, wake up!
He's coming 'round, Jim...
Congratulations, Jim. I think you've saved the Earth.
Hi... Busy?
Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.
Umm. Well, just wanted to say -- nice to have your katra back in your head, not mine. I mean, I may have carried your soul, but I sure couldn't fill your shoes.
... My shoes...
Forget it... How 'bout covering a little philosophical ground? Life, Death, Life... Things of that nature?
I did not have time on Vulcan to review the Philosophical disciplines.
Spock, it's me, Bones! I mean our experience was unique. You really have gone where no man has gone before. Can't you tell me what it felt like?
It would be impossible to discuss the subject without a common frame of reference.
You're joking...!
A joke is a story with a humorous climax.
You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. I find it illogical that its intentions are hostile...
Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth?
There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man.
Specifically, Humpback Whales.
10 million years earlier. Humpbacks were heavily hunted by Man. They have been extinct since the 21st Century... It is possible that an alien intelligence sent the probe to determine why they lost contact.
You just said there aren't any except on Earth of the past.
That is what I said, Doctor.
Angels and ministers of grace, defend us.
You, ah... You present the appearance of a man with a problem.
Your perception is correct, Doctor... In order to return us to the exact moment at which we left the 23rd Century, I have used our journey back through time as a referent, calculating the coefficient of elapsed time in relation to the acceleration curve.
Naturally. So what is your problem?
Acceleration is no longer a constant.
Well, you're gonna have to take your best shot.
... Best shot...?
Guess, Spock. Your best guess.
"Guessing" is not in my nature...
... I don't think he understands...
You're saying... It is a compliment.
Who are you? Doctor Adams was supposed to assist me.
We're just -- observing.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
What's your degree in, dentistry?
How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?
Fundoscopic examination --
Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases!
A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.
What's causing that!?
Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!
Can you isolate the wave?
Damage report!
Captain... All systems have failed... We are functioning on reserve power only.
Find it?
Team leader, this is team 2. Come in, please...
I have the coordinates of the reactor...
... It gives me a great sense of history.
How long?
All right, Commander, you wanna tell us anything?
Like what?
My name is Pavel Chekov. I am a Lt. Commander in Starfleet, United Federation of Planets, service number 656-5827b.
All right. Let's take it from the top.
The top of what?
Name?
My name?
No, <u>my</u> name.
I do not know your name.
You play games with me and you're through
Okay... Make nice and give us the ray gun.
I varn you. If you don't lie on the floor, I vill have to stun you.
Go ahead. Stun me.
Operational, Admiral. Cloaking Device now available in all modes of flight.
I'm impressed, Mr. Chekov. A lot of effort for a short voyage.
We are in an enemy wessel, sir. I didn't wish to be shot down on thee way to our own funeral.
No, sir. And no Federation wessels on assigned patrol stations.
Shields, Mr. Chekov.
Shields, aye.
No choice now, Scotty!
Yes, sir.
Ah, well done, team 2.
And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
Cloaking device is stable... All systems normal.
The mains are down, sir! Aux power is not responding.
Status report, Admiral!
Mr. President, the Probe has passed through all quadrants. The starships Shepard and Yorktown and three smaller vessels have been neutralized.
"Neutralized?" How?
We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand...
Can you protect us?
To hunt a species to extinction is not logical.
Attempting the hell to communicate.
They like you very much. But they are not the hell your whales.
I suppose they told you that...?
So you were at Berkeley.
Are you sure it isn't time for a colorful metaphor?
You sure you won't change your mind?
You mean man...
They are mature humpbacks, weighing 45,000 pounds each. They wandered into San Francisco Bay as calves and were brought here. We call them George and Gracie.
Despite all the things they are teaching us we have to return George and Gracie to the open sea.
Why's that?
Well, for one thing, we simply don't have the money to keep feeding them a couple of tons of shrimp a day!
How soon?
Ohhh<u>kay</u>. I don't know what this is about, but I want you guys outta here right now or I call the cops.
I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help...
Back to San Francisco.
Came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies, huh?
There's really very little point in my trying to explain.
I buy that. What about him?
He's harmless. Back in the sixties he was part of the Free Speech movement at Berkeley. I think he did too much LDS.
LDS?? Are you dyslexic on top of everything else? Come on, Lemme give you a lift. I have a notorious weakness for hard luck cases -- that's why I work with whales.
We don't want to be any trouble.
Thanks.
Memory problems, too.
Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
Iowa.
A landlubber. Come on, what the hell were you boys really trying to do back there? Was it some kinda macho thing? If that's all, I'm gonna be real disappointed. I hate that macho type.
Can I ask <u>you</u> something?
Go ahead.
They're gonna hafta take their chances.
What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances.
No, ma'am. No dipshit.
All right. Who are you? and don't jerk me around any more. I want to know how you know that.
We can't tell you. Please, just -- let me finish. I can tell you that we're not in the military and that we intend no harm to the whales.
Then --
In fact, we may be able to help -- in ways that, frankly, you couldn't possibly imagine.
Or believe, I'll bet.
Just a little joke. See you later, old friend.
He's just going to hang around the bushes while we eat?
Do you trust me?
Implicitly.
So how did a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist?
Just lucky, I guess.
You're upset about losing the whales.
... You're very perceptive.
How will that be done, exactly?
They'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there.
Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?
See, yes. But we'll tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them.
You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.
Thanks. Cheers.
If you have such a low opinion of my abilities, how come we're having dinner?
Where could you take them?
Hm?
My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
Sorry, the time would have to be right now.
What do you mean now?
What's that?
What's what?
Wanna try it from the top?
Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
... Who are you?
Don't tell me: you're from outer space.
No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.
Well, I was close. I knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later.
All right. The truth?
I'm all ears.
That's what you think. Okay...Truth... I'm from what, on your calendar, would be the late 23rd Century. I've been sent back in time to bring two Humpback Whales with me in an attempt to... repopulate the species.
Well, why didn't you say so? Why all the coy disguises?
You want the details?
Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.
Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
Jesus, you are persistent. Okay, your friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... At noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out.
Well, "Admiral," that may be the strangest dinner of my life and the biggest cockamamie fish story I've ever heard.
Sorry, that's classified. I don't really have a clue who you are... You wouldn't want to show me around your space ship, would you?
It wouldn't be my first choice, no.
So. There we are.
Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
I bet you're a damn good poker player.
Think about it -- but don't take too long because I'm out of time. If you change your mind, this is where I'll be.
Here... In the park?
It's true... what you said...
Steady, now. We need your help.
Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
It's all real. Look. The storage tanks for the whales.
But Kirk...
We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...
Kirk. They're gone.
... Gone?!
They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
What kind of spaceship is this, anyway?
If we keep going up, they'll catch us!
Gillian... Would the whales be at sea by now?
Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you.
All I need is the radio frequency to track them.
What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.
You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.
What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...
I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The <u>frequency</u>.
All right. The frequency is 401 megahertz.
You tricked me.
Oh my God, we're too late!
... What does that mean?
He means our chances of getting home are not very good. You might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong.
I belong here. Suppose by some miracle you do get them through. Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales?
Hey! -- Where you going?!
You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
You mean this is -- goodbye?
Why does it have to be goodbye?
Well, I... As they say in your century -- I don't even have your phone number. How will I find you?
Permission to come aboard.
Permission granted.
Thank you, Admiral.
Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire. I seem to have misplaced my uniform.
Spock -- you're suggesting the transmission is meant for life form other than man?
A distinct possibility, Admiral. The President did say the transmission was directed at the Earth's Oceans
Where are you going?!
Spock...?
As suspected, the Probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales.
Spock, could the Humpback's answer to this call be simulated?
The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.
Is there any other planet where this species exists?
The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.
That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth.
That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.
But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?
Mr. Spock, your computations?
In progress, Admiral.
Ready to engage computer, Admiral.
What is our target in time?
The late 20th Century.
Surely you can be more specific...
Not with this equipment. I have had to program some of the variables from memory.
What are the variables...?
Availability of fuel components; Mass of the vessel through a time continuum, and the probable location of Humpbacks, in this case, the Pacific basin.
You've programmed that from memory...?
Earth... But when?... Spock?
Judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere, I believe we have arrived at the late 20th Century.
Home in on the strongest signal. Descend from orbit.
Admiral, if I may: we're probably already visible to the tracking devices of the time.
There is a 20th Century possibility.
Explain.
If memory serves, there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side effects. By the beginning of the fusion era, these reactors had been replaced, but at this time, we should be able to find some.
But you said toxic.
We could rig a device to collect their high energy photons safely; we could then inject the photons into the dilithium chamber, causing crystalline restructure.... Theoretically.
Where would we find these reactors... Theoretically.
Weren't those a birthday present from Dr. McCoy?
Well, Spock, thanks to your restored memory and a little bit of luck, we are in the streets of San Francisco looking for a pair of humpback whales. How do you propose to solve this minor problem?
I think we'll find what we're looking for at the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito. Two Humpbacks called George and Gracie.
How do you know this...?
As you observed, a primitive Culture.
Yes.
Admiral, may I ask you a question?
Spock, don't call me Admiral. Don't you remember: you used to call me Jim... Now what's your question?
Your use of language has altered since our arrival. It is currently laced with -- shall I say -- more colorful metaphors: "Double dumb ass on you" -- and so forth...
You mean profanity. That's simply the way they talk here. Nobody pays any attention to you if you don't swear every other word. You'll find it in all the literature of the period.
Oh, the complete works of Jacqueline Susan, the novels of Harold Robbins....
Come on, fellah -- speak up!
Spock...
Yes?
About those colorful metaphors we discussed. I don't think you should try to use them.
Why not?
Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.
I see.
And another thing... It is not always necessary to tell the truth.
I cannot tell a lie.
You don't have to lie... You could exaggerate.
Exaggerate.
You've done it before. Can't you remember?
The hell I can't
What else did you learn from your mind meld?
They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
They have a right to be... Do you think they'll help us?
I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.
It's her -- from the Institute. If we play our cards right, we may learn when those whales are really leaving.
I meant --
Status?
The tank will be finished by morning...
That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.
Damn.... Damnit! We've been so lucky. We have the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don't move quickly, we'll lose them!
In that event, the probabilities are that our mission would fail.
Admiral. Full power is restored.
Admiral, may I suggest that Dr. McCoy is correct. We must help Chekov.
Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...?
No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do.
Mr. Spock, where the hell is the power you promised me?
Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'm taking our guest down to see her whales. Mr. Spock: have you accounted for the variable mass of whales and water in your time re-entry program?
Mr. Scott cannot give me exact figures, Admiral. So I will... Make a <u>guess</u>.
Can we make breakaway speed!?
Spock... Did braking thrusters fire?
They did, Admiral.
Spock: Condition report!
You got us to the right place, Spock. Now all we have to do is get the whales out before we <u>sink</u>. Mr. Scott, come in!... Scotty...?! Damn... Mr. Spock, see to the safety of all hands.
Guidance is functional. Onboard Computer will interface with Federation memory bank...
Estimating Planet Earth one point six hours present speed.
Warp two... three...
Warp Nine... Nine point two... Nine point three...
Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed!
Hang on, sir... Nine point seven... point eight... Breakaway threshold...
Mr. Sulu...? ... Mr. Sulu?!
... Aye sir...?
What is our condition?
Sir... Braking thrusters seem to have fired.
Aye, sir. Descending.
Ready sir.
Maintaining impulse climb. Wing five by zero, helm steady.
Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero.
Three-one-zero, aye!
10,000 M.S.L., Admiral.
Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
10 seconds, sir!
I have no control, sir!
Sir -- I've got some back pressure on manual --
Let's see what she's got, Mr. Sulu.
Systems report. Communications?
Communications Systems ready. Communications Officer -- ready as she'll ever be.
What is it?
Overlapping distress calls. Some from Starships... others...
Then, this is what it would sound like underwater?
Admiral, I am receiving whale songs.
Individual whale song getting stronger... This is strange, Admiral. The song is directly ahead. It's coming from San Francisco.
I'll have bearing and distance for you, sir.
We'll stick together till we get orientated. Bearing to the whales?
283 degrees... 15.2 kilometers...
Any luck...?
Nothing... I should never have left him...
I've found Chekov, sir: he's in emergency surgery right now.
Uhura!... Where!
Bearing!
Bearing 327, range 600 nautical.
Admiral, I have a signal closing on the whales. Bearing 328 degrees.
Estimate range, ship to whales!
Unidentified aircraft, 40,000 feet MSL, range 30 miles, bearing 010.
I can't, sir -- Nothing!
Mr. Scott, how soon can we get underway?
We're ready, sir. I've converted the Dilithium Sequencer to something less primitive. And Admiral -- I've replaced the Klingon Food Packs. They was givin' me sour stomach.
Scotty, how long is this bay?
About 60 feet, Admiral.
That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water?
Scotty, we have to find some Humpbacks.
Humpbacked - people.?
Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece.
Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them.
Two?
They're giving out. De-crystallizing.
Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott.
I can't believe we've come this far only to be stopped by this! Scotty, is there any way dilithium can be re-crystallized?
What is it? I thought I told you never to call me --
Sorry, Admiral. We just thought you'll like to know, we're beaming them now.
It's going slow, sir. It'll be well into tomorrow.
Not good enough, Scotty. You've got to do better!
I'm ready Spock. Let's go find George and Gracie...
Scotty: Are the whale tanks secure?
Stay with me, sir -- I need more power curve...
How long, Scotty?
Admiral! There be whales here!
Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed?
I'll have to re-energize.
Stand by, sir. Miracle worker at work...
Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
Full power, sir.
Ironic. When man was killing these creatures, he was destroying his own future...
You better get up there, sir. We're having some power fall-off...
The whales...?!
No power to the bay doors.
The explosive override -- ?
It's under water! There's no way to reach it...
Go on ahead... Close the hatch!
Excelsior? Why in God's name would you want that bucket of bolts?
Admiral, I'd like to continue my work on the ship until you leave.
Thank you, Lt. Saavik.
And... Here is a deposition I have made. If it is not sufficient, I will return to Earth to testify.
Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause. How are you feeling?
I am well, Admiral.
Well, Saavik. I guess this is goodbye.
Even as the Federation negotiated a peace treaty with us, Kirk was secretly developing the Genesis torpedo! Conceived by Kirk's son and test detonated by the Admiral himself! The result of this awesome energy was euphemistically called "The Genesis Planet..." A secret base from which to launch the. annihilation of the Klingon people! We demand the extradition of Kirk! We demand justice!
Genesis was perfectly named: The creation of life not death. It was the Klingons who had first blood while trying to possess its secrets.
Vulcans are well known as the intellectual puppets of the Federation!
Your vessel did destroy U.S.S. Grissom. Your men did kill Kirk's son. Do you deny these events?
We deny nothing! We have the right to preserve our race!
Don't know anything about it? I find it difficult to believe that I've come millions of miles --
Professor Scott, if you'll --
With pleasure.
Well, that's different.
If you'll follow me, Professor --
I will. Can my assistant come, too?
Doctor Nichols, I might have something to offer <u>you</u>.
... Yes?
I notice you're still working with polymers.
Sill? What else would I be working with?
Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?
That's easy: 6 inches. We carry stuff that big in stock.
Yes, I noticed. Now suppose -- just suppose -- I could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but was only an inch thick. would that be worth something to you, eh?
Hello? Computer...?
Just use the keyboard...
Transparent aluminum?
That's the ticket, laddie.
Hi.
Hi. Huey 205, isn't it?
Right on. You fly?
Oh, here and there. I flew something similar in my Academy days.
All right, then this is old stuff to you.
Father...?
I will be returning to Vulcan within the hour... I wanted to take my leave of you.
It is kind of you to make this effort.
It is not an effort. You are my son. Besides; I am most impressed with your performance in this -- crises.
As I recall, I opposed your enlistment in Starfleet... It is possible that judgment was incorrect. Your associates are people of good character.
They are my friends.
Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?
Ojichan? Akira ojichaan dewa naino? Koko de nani shiteru no?
Gomen nasarei. Hito chigai de gozaranuka na. I'm sorry, my son. You have mis- taken me for someone else.
Chotto omachi nasarei. Namae wa nanto moosareruka na. Wait my son. What is your name?
Sulu Hikaru.
Ah, sorenara mazu mazu nagaiki wo sareru to mira. Ah... Then I am sure that you will have a long and happy life.
We were under the impression they were being held against their will.
My people have a strict policy of non-interference with other cultures. In fact, it's our Prime Directive.
Your directive apparently doesn't include spying on other cultures.
You have warp capability?
I understand how you feel. We just want to retrace Data's movements that day...
Why?
I don't like to leave questions unanswered.
I know what a hologram is, Captain. The question is -- why would someone want to create one of our village?
Deceive us?
Don't panic...
There's an unusual metaphasic radiation coming from the planet's rings. It continuously regenerates the cells in our bodies. You must have noticed the effects by now.
Clearly, the architects of this conspiracy have tried to keep it a secret. Not just from you, but from my people as well. I don't intend to let them.
We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life...
Most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down.
But not you.
There are days.
You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard.
In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me...
... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so.
The craftsmanship is extraordinary.
This is a school... that's a student's work. She'll be ready to become an apprentice soon. Then, in thirty or forty years, she'll take her place among the artisans...
An apprentice for thirty years. We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?
More questions. Always the explorer. If you stay long enough, that'll change.
Will it?
You'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday... stop planning for tomorrow... until you find... Let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?
A perfect moment?
When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...
Seeing my home planet from space for the first time...
Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception. You explore the universe. We've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them...
I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.
There's one thing I don't understand. In three hundred years...you never learned to swim?
I wonder if you're aware of the trust you endanger, Jean-Luc Picard. In my experience, it's unusual for...
... an offlander?
When we're forced away by the terrain, we'll use transport inhibitors to compensate. The mountains have the highest concentrations. Once we're there, transport will be virtually impossible...
There are caves in those mountains.
Jak'tahla?
Right beyond that ridge is where the caves begin... we can hide for days...
How is it a woman like you never married? And don't tell me you "just haven't gotten around to it yet"...
What's the rush?
There's a cavern at the base of the next hill...
You're Ro'tin, aren't you...? There's something in the voice. Would you be his friend Gal'na? I helped your mother bathe you when you were a child. She still speaks of you.
Mother and son. You arranged this...?
But I have three hundred and eighteen days of vacation time coming. I plan on using them.
Do you really think your mighty Federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people?
There is no need for concern. I am operating within normal parameters now.
You're what?
My father told me I shouldn't talk to you.
I understand.
Not everyone here agrees with him. I mean, you know, about machines. There was even a big fight about it once. Do you like being a machine?
I aspire to be more than I am.
I know why. So people like us won't be afraid of you any more.
Don't you ever get tired?
My power cells continually re- charge themselves.
Perhaps it would surprise you to know that I have often tried to imagine what it would be like to be a child...
Really?
Really.
For one thing, your legs are shorter than everyone else's.
But they are in a constant state of growth. Do you find it difficult to adapt? A child's specifications are never the same from one moment to the next. I am surprised that you do not... trip over your own feet.
Sometimes I do.
But you've never had adults telling you what to do all the time... or bedtimes... or having to eat food you don't like...
I would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child.
Do machines ever play?
I play the violin... and my chess routines are quite advanced...
Chase me!
For what purpose?
Because you're it. And if you tag me... then I'm it.
But I can run much faster than you... I am capable of exceeding forty-seven meters per second...
Data... haven't you ever just played... for fun?
Androids... don't have...fun.
Why not...?
No one's ever asked me that before.
Anij!
Tournel will take you the rest of the way...
No... I want to stay with you...
I have to go home now.
Can he breathe under water?
Data doesn't breathe.
Won't he rust?
To many offlanders, what you have here would be more valuable than gold-pressed latinum. And I'm afraid it's the reason that someone is trying to take this world away from you.
The artificial lifeform was right?
Captain, the Son'a hostages declined to be examined. I had them confined to quarters.
And our people?
They all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production... probably the result of the environmental anomalies here...
Are they in any danger?
Not at all. They're fine... in fact, they're better than fine. Increased metabolism, high energy, improved muscle tone. We should all be so lucky.
You either need a new uniform or a new neck.
'Yew-cheen chef-faw'... My collar size is exactly the same as it was at the Academy.
Very funny...
Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship...
Will he live?
She's stabilizing.
Is it safe to move her?
Hello, Data...
Captain, Geordi...?
Yes... that looks like them.
What's the last thing you remember, Data...
'his nose should pant and his lip should curl...'
From the mission...
I believe the boy is... afraid... of me.
It's nothing personal data. You have to remember these people have rejected technology. And you...
... I am the personification of everything they have rejected.
Until this week, that young man probably never saw a machine, let alone one that walks and talks...
Tricorder functions are limited due to heavy deposits of kelbonite in these hills...
A ship,
It is clearly Federation in origin, Captain.
Incomplete, I might add.
... it is conceivable I was shot to protect the secret of its existence.
Why would the Federation or the Son'a wish to move the Ba'ku?
Captain, I've activated transport inhibitors around the village...
How many?
I'm showing fresh air behind this calcite formation, Captain...
Will the structure hold if we blast through?
Your Federation procedures have made this mission ten times as difficult as it needed to be...
Our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk...
Take us into a high orbit. Lie down, Admiral. The girls will take twenty years off your face...
Your self-restraint puzzles me, Admiral. You continue to deny yourself every benefit this mission has to offer...
Your android has turned dangerously violent, Captain... Considerable damage was done to my ship. He must be destroyed.
It isn't safe for you to remain in this area.
Take me down. Let me talk to Picard.
Talk... we should send down an assault team and take them by force.
That is not an acceptable option. If people get hurt, all the support we have in the Federation...
I'll order Riker to turn around.
You're not going to launch anything until...
We're taking this ship out of here... this mission is over...
It is not over.
I do not take orders from you.
You have no idea what precipitated his behavior?
... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...
The Enterprise can be at your position in two days, Admiral...
That's probably not a good idea. Your ship hasn't been fitted for this region; there are environmental concerns...
What kind of concerns?
Captain, I wasn't expecting you.
This was too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines, Admiral...
I wish I had better news. Commander Data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday. Ru'afo and I have decided to send in an assault team...
All right. You have twelve hours, Captain. Then I want you out of The Briar Patch. In the meantime, we'll be heading out to the perimeter to call for Son'a reinforcements in case you fail.
Understood.
... and because they have warp capabilities, the consequences to their society are minimal...
You've done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How's Data?
In stasis. La Forge is completing the diagnostic.
I'll need all your paperwork tomorrow. We're heading back your way. Set a course to rendezvous with us so you can transfer the crew and equipment on your way out.
You're not finished here?
You're looking well, Jean-Luc. Rested.
Your "Briar Patch" turned out to be more hospitable than I expected.
That's why we put chromodynamic shields in place - so our people wouldn't feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation...
... or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world. I won't let you move them, Admiral. I'll go to the Federation Council...
I'm acting on orders form the Federation Council.
How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...?
The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.
Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?
There are six hundred people down there. We'll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions. The Son'a have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles form the planets rings...
A planet in Federation space...
Right. We have the planet and they have the technology -- a technology we can't duplicate. You know what that makes us? Their partners.
Our partners are nothing more than petty thugs.
On Earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders. Warp drive transformed a bunch of Romulan thugs into an empire. We can handle the Son'a, I'm not worried about that...
Someone probably said the same thing about the Romulans a century ago.
With metaphasics, lifespans will be doubled... an entire new medical science will evolve... I understand your Chief Engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life... would you take his sight away from him?
There are metaphasic particles all over The Briar Patch. Why must this planet be...
The concentration in the rings is what makes the whole damned thing work. Don't ask me to explain it. I only know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic reaction. After it's over, the planet will be unlivable for generations.
Delay the procedure. Let my people look at the technology.
Our best scientific minds already have. We can't find any other way to do this.
Then the Son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do...
It would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition. Some of them won't survive that long. Besides, they don't want to live in the middle of The Briar Patch... who would?
We are betraying the principles upon which the Federation was founded... this is an attack on the very soul of the Federation. This will destroy the Ba'ku. Just as cultures have been destroyed in every other forced relocation throughout history.
We are only moving six hundred people, Jean-Luc.
Order them to surrender, and I promise you won't be court- martialed.
I wonder... which one of us will be facing that court-martial...
A coward... without the moral courage to stop an unspeakable atrocity. You offend me.
Is this how a Federation officer begs for his life?
What you're asking me to do... is impossible... the crew is loyal to Ru'afo...
Do you know how to disable the injector?
But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.
If we could lure him away from the bridge...
It doesn't matter where he is. As soon as he realizes something is happening, he'll override my commands with one word at his com- link...
The countdown control has been transferred to the collector...I can't override...
Gallatin! So the righteous Starfleet Captain finally released you. Did you encounter any problems on the surface?
No, sir. But it wasn't easy... being among them...
The injector performs perfectly in every simulation...
Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface. It appeared to be the Captain's Yacht. Five persons on board.
They're following the kelbonite deposits... using the interference to block our transporters...
There is an alternative to an all- out assault. Isolinear tags would allow our transporters to lock on to them.
Admiral Dougherty will not be joining us for diner. Deploy the collector. Do you have a problem with those orders?
May I talk to you alone?
Moving them is one thing. Killing them all...
Separate the Starfleet personnel and secure them in the aft cargo hold... see that Picard joins them...
The shields in that section won't protect them against the thermolytic reaction...
I want our guests to depart as quickly a etiquette allows. I'll ask Worf to delay his return to DS9 so he can join us. We're going to stop by sector four-four- one on our way to the Goren system.
They... are in opposite directions, sir...
We're about to lose communications with Starfleet, Captain.
The torque sensors are out of alignment... by twelve microns... you could hear that?
I took these out of Data's neural net... they contain memory engrams...
Do you know how they were damaged?
By a Son'a weapon. There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.
The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.
I don't believe it happened that way.
Why would they fire at him without provocation?
All I know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot. Then, his fail-safe system was activated...
Fail-safe?
His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...
So, you're saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong.
In a sense, that's all he knew. The system is designed to protect him against anyone who might try to take advantage of his memory loss.
Implants bothering you?
Funniest thing, Captain. There wasn't anything wrong with my implants. There was something right with my eyes. When Doctor Crusher removed the ocular connections, she found the cells around my optic nerves...
... had regenerated.
A photon torpedo. Isn't that the universal greeting when communications are down?
Full impulse.
The manifold can't handle full impulse in the Patch, Commander.
If we don't outrun them, the manifolds are going to be the only thing left of this ship.
Will that stop the tear?
You got me, Commander.
That's your expert opinion?
We're pulling it like a zipper across space...
Options?
Aye, sir. Highly volatile...I recommend we keep our distance...
Negative. I want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can...
I wouldn't be surprised if history remembers this as the Riker Maneuver...
If it works you mean.
I don't think they believe us.
Sir, they've detonated an isolytic burst... a subspace tear is forming...
The tear is closing on us... impact in fifteen seconds...
The purpose being I intend to shove it down the Son'a's throat.
Commander, if one of their weapons hits that gas...
Commander, I'm showing two Son'a ships on an intercept course.
How long 'til they reach us?
What's inside that nebula cluster?
Cometary debris, pockets of unstable metreon gas... we don't want to go in there, sir...
I thought subspace weapons were banned by the Khitomer Accord...
We're still thirty-six minutes from transmission range, sir.
They're powering their forward weapons array.
They need us to mediate some territorial dispute...
We can't delay the archaeological expedition to Hanoran Two. It would put us into the middle of monsoon season...
The Diplomatic Corps is busy with Dominion negotiations.
'Yew-cheen chef-faw.'
Who is it?
... and gorgonzolla cheese.
We won't be able to go any faster than one-third impulse in that muck...
Nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey...
So where are the 'environmental concerns' the Admiral was talking about?
Admiral Dougherty wants to know why we haven't left yet...
Deck five.
Prepare the ship for departure at oh-seven-hundred hours.
You must be planning on doing some hunting.
There's a short letter I left you all, just some... sentimental nonsense... the computer will bring it to your attention at oh- four-hundred... I'd just as soon you delete it...
The Council has ordered a halt to the Ba'ku relocation while they conduct a top-level review.
My name is Sojef, Captain.
Jean-Luc Picard... my officers Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi.
Would you like something to eat?
No, we're here to... rescue them.
We came here from a solar system on the verge of self- annihilation... where technology had created weapons that threatened to destroy all life. A small group of us set off to find a new home... a home that would be isolated from the threats of other worlds. That was three hundred and nine years ago.
You've not aged a day since then?
I wish there was a way to bring them back home.
Ask them.
Bridge to Captain Picard. We are approaching sector four-four-one.
I... I must have slept through my alarm. I'm on my way...
Worf to Picard...
Yes... yes, I... can hear you...
Worf, you must hurry...
We're coming as fast as we can... we can't risk using phasers...
Captain...
I've already modified a tricorder with one of his spare actuation servos. Its operational range is only seven meters but it should shut him down...
Sensors are not picking up any ships coming from the surface...
Transmit a wide band co-variant signal. That'll get his attention.
He might be using the planet's rings to mask his approach.
Come out, come out wherever you are...
Sir?
Sir, if we fire a tachyon burst, it may force him to reset his shield harmonics. When he does, we could beam him out...
Direct hit. He's resetting his shield harmonics...
He's activated a transport inhibitor.
Scanners are off line!
Do you know Gilbert and Sullivan?
No, sir. I haven't had a chance to meet all the new crew members since I've been back...
Sir, inertial coupling is exceeding tolerance... if we don't release him, he may destroy both vessels...
The damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire!
Did any of the hostages mention a cloaked ship during their debriefings?
No, sir...
Debrief them again. Have you been in a fight, Commander?
No, sir. It is a gorch.
Doctor Crusher asked to talk to you when you returned...
Should I distribute phasers to the Ba'ku, sir...?
You need a haircut, Commander.
The Ba'ku could use some rest, sir. According to the geo-scan, this may be the safest area for the next few kilometers...
Isolinear tags. Their transporters can lock onto them.
All injector sub-systems are confirmed off-line.
One. It's Ru'afo.
Can you beam him off?
Negative. He's established a security field around the control room...
... Population three hundred million...
Say the greeting again...
Oh, my God, are they vegetarians? That's not in here...
We've downloaded all the files on the duck blind mission as well as intelligence reports on the Son'a.
Counselor?
The Son'a discovered an M-class planet with humanoid life six months ago. Turned out it's in us to get approval for a sociological study. The Federation Council suggested it be a joint mission...
Why was Data assigned?
I don't see anything to suggest the Son'a have any interest in sociology...
What are they interested in...?
Wine, women and song.
Nomadic, collectors of precious metals, jewels...
Hmm, I should feel right at home with them...
Why would we be involved with these people?
You haven't done that in a long time...
What...?
What you're doing to my neck...
It says here that some form of genetic damage has apparently prevented the Son'a from procreating...
No children?
Come in. Hi.
Got a minute? I... need a little counseling. First time for everything. Do I... lie down... or what?
This isn't one of the usual therapeutic postures...
But it's comfortable.
Why don't you try sitting up?
Or you could try lying down.
Both. I think I'm having a mid-life crisis...
... I believe you...
... I'm not sleeping well...
What I need, I can't get from Doctor Crusher... Counselor, do you think it's possible for two people to go back in time to fix a mistake they've made?
Augh.
Augh?
All hands. Battle stations!
Initiate launch sequence.
Exactly as the simulations predicted...
Sir, I am not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels...
Your scanners must be malfunctioning.
This ship is equipped with fourteen long range transporters... are they all useless...?
They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.
The new quantum torpedoes are doing the trick, Jean-Luc. We've destroyed forty-seven Borg ships so far... and only lost fifteen of our own. But one of the Borg ships has broken through our defenses, and it's heading directly for Earth. Can you handle it?
Absolutely.
Good hunting. Hayes out.
Admiral... what's the status of the Borg fleet?
It's been destroyed. The Borg threat is over. Are you all right? The Enterprise disappeared from our sensors for a moment.
We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.
Montana. Energize.
Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here?
We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
Yes...
But he's been dead for three hundred... Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
It's Cochrane.
It's not the radiation... and there's nothing wrong with the combadges... the Enterprise just isn't responding.
Jean-Luc, this man needs medical attention, now.
What are we waiting for? Let's go.
It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.
Are you saying they won't help us?
I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.
There must be some good people... even in this time.
He's stable... for now. But it would be better if we could contact... our friends.
Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got.
I have to go back to the silo. Will you be all right?
You actually performed surgery...?
But I had a little help. Surgical transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain.
How did Doctor Almack react to that?
He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed. Any word from the Enterprise?
Not yet.
You think they're still up there?
If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
Regardless of how I may feel about Ruby... our fates lie along different paths. Nothing can change that.
You want some advice? Don't do this again. You know exactly what I mean.
Beverly, there were many reasons why you and I...
How long has he been unconscious?
Is it Japanese?
Um... yeah. Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
His automatic reflexes are fluctuating. We've got to get him on a respirator.
The occipital fracture is widening... we're going to have to fuse the bones...
You are the guiding intelligence behind the Borg...?
Have you ever wondered what it's like to have flesh?
You've taken your first step toward perfection. How does it feel?
I do not know what you are referring to.
Do you know what this is, Data?
It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure.
No. I will not betray my friends.
They're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny...
That is not true. They have tried to help me.
Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?
You're becoming more human all the time, Data. Now you're learning how to lie.
I wish to... go back to the way I was.
Have you ever know a woman? Do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh?
My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
I am... grateful for what you have given me. But I still do not wish to be assimilated.
Yes...
I've deactivated the sensory inputs. That flesh on your body is just meat, now.
Isn't it better like this...?
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
No... no, it's so... empty... please... give it back... I need it...
There is a perimeter alert. A ship has entered sensor range.
Vulcan?
Your diagnostics are in error. I need weapons.
The problem must lie in the interface between Starfleet and Borg technology. Your console may not be configured to handle the data flow.
Can you configure it?
I believe so.
Dispersive armor is holding.
The Borg ship has modified its shields, Captain. Our phasers will no longer be effective.
We are approaching the Terran System, Captain.
Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
It has entered Earth orbit. Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.
I have helm control.
The vortex is collapsing, sir.
What year is it?
Mister Data, I want to know the exact date and time. Give me a damage report on that missile silo.
But now... they are all one with the Borg.
I am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. As an android, I am in complete control of my neural net. The information contained there cannot be forcibly removed.
Who are you?
I am the Borg.
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
The planet's surface is covered with Borg technology. So is the moon... and three other planets in this solar system.
Did you know her?
Data... are you sure you're all right?
I am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming. Grief, loss, remorse...
No. Human beings do not have that luxury, and neither should I.
"APR cell count?" What the hell are you talking about?
Juice?
Where's the battery room for the hospital?
I told you, there's no --
Where?
What did you do to the batteries?
Captain, I'm starting to worry about the hull integrity. We've been running the support field at full power for three hours straight. I don't know how much longer it's going to hold up.
I have the silo, sir. Bearing three one zero... distance, three hundred meters.
This must be it.
How serious is the damage?
I'm having trouble scanning underground. There's a lot of radiation leaking from something.
I'm picking up faint life signs twenty meters below.
Alphanumeric lock. We need a password to get in...
Blast door. It's designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched.
Picard to Enterprise. Enterprise, please respond.
This used to be the throttle valve assembly. It controls the thrust of the engines. It's been completely vaporized... and without it, there's no way to launch the ship.
Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...
We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours... There must be some design schematics... blueprints...
Maybe... Sure. Yeah. As long as I could get a clear look at the intake configuration. But so far, we haven't found any other photos.
Where's you get the alloy for the throttle itself?
Ready to make a little history?
Always am.
We can't leave her out there. When the ship launches... she'll be killed.
Tell her to go back to Resurrection.
Captain --
Captain... we've got less than ten minutes before that Vulcan ship leaves the system. We've got to go <U>now</U>.
No... the door's too thick.
Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...
What's still there?
Solid rocket fuel at twenty-five thousand kilograms...
Altitude fifty kilometers...
Entering the upper ionospere...
There's a red light on the second intake valve.
Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.
The Vulcans should be out there right now. We need to break the warp barrier in the next five minutes if we're going to get their attention.
Bring the warp core on-line. I'll lay in a heading.
The nacelles are charged... nuclear warhead standing by. We're ready to ignite the warp drive.
Passing one-half light speed. The starboard nacelle's running a little hot...
The inertial dampers are having trouble compensating... I don't think Cochrane built this thing for comfort.
There's no temporal shielding in here! We're starting to pick up relativistic effects!
Captain, the Enterprise!
Their com system must still be down.
They're getting awfully close... what the hell are they doing?
Are we on schedule? The Vulcan ship will be here in less than two hours.
It'll be tight, but we should make it.
What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect.
I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it.
ATR setting...
Active.
Main bus...
Ready.
Oh... yes... ultraviolet protection. Thank you. Mister...?
Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of the Resurrection Protective Force. And you are?
Jean-Luc Picard.
Great name. French?
Yes.
Where in the States?
Oh... here and there. You know how it is.
Where are you from most recently?
California. San Francisco.
Beautiful city. Used to be, anyway. I didn't think anyone still lived there.
That was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital's batteries. How'd you do it?
It wasn't a trick. I used to be an electrical engineer.
And what were you doing out at the missile silo?
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
Lucky for him you came by when you did. He might be dead now.
Yes.
Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning...
You seem to have an answer for everything.
Something wrong with that?
What do you want?
The invasion plans.
Invasion.
There is no invasion...
From another planet. Oh, I almost forgot... they have green blood and pointed ears.
And you know all this... because <U>you're</U> a space-man too...
Take care of him. He's a very special man.
What are you, an idiot? Didn't you see the red light was on?
Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that --
Cochrane?
Yes... and I only had enough silver halide for one shot. So you're lucky you didn't screw it up.
Did you need something?
Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.
Bed sheets. I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years.
"Money." So you can get dome money...
I can try.
No... but sometimes I feel that way. What I meant was, I'd be willing to trade for the photographs.
Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer. Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?
I'm an old friend... I met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at Cornell back in --
What?
You're lying.
What makes you say that?
You're not someone who lies very easily... so it's obvious when you do... at least to me.
Were the two of you... involved?
No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be.
Ruby... I need to talk to you about those photographs. It's very important.
I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
It can't wait until tomorrow...
I'd say you already have.
Okay, let's hear it. I'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house.
We're trying to repair Doctor Cochrane's ship. It's been damaged and --
We?
Myself... and a few other friends of Zephram's.
Friends from Cornell...
Some.
Lie. That's one. Keep going.
A key piece of the ship has been destroyed... and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like.
All right. Truth. I believe that one. Why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?
We have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon.
Why are you being so difficult? All I'm asking for is to look at one of the photographs. It'll take five minutes.
And all I'm asking for is the truth. That would take five minutes. For all I know, you caused the explosions at the silo... and now you're trying to steal Zephram's ship.
You're leaving, aren't you?
I have to...
Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...
No. It's a lot further than that.
It's the future, isn't it? Just like you told Scrimm. I knew you weren't from around here.
No... I'm from France.
I don't care if you're from France or Venus... just take me with you.
That's impossible.
Why?
This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.
Signal the Endeavor to fall back. We'll cover them.
Incoming transmission from the Borg.
Life signs?
Captain...?
Track their weapons fire.
Port battery, ready sir!
Time travel... they're attempting time travel... Full power, Mister Data. Worf, quantum torpedoes at my command!
Captain, there are five Borg ships closing in on our position.
Hull integrity down to thirty percent...
Captain, I've found the Borg Sphere. It's on the far side of the planet...firing at the surface.
Intercept course, full impulse. Weapons status?
Phasers are off-line... we have two quantum torpedoes left. But the computer targeting system has been destroyed.
Target locked!
Worf, have Doctor Crusher, Mister La Forge and a security team meet me in Transporter Room Three. Civilian clothes.
Incoming transmission from Starfleet Command. Admiral Hayes.
We're caught in some kind of energy wake from the vortex...
They must've done it in the past... they went back and changed history...
Report.
We're still in Earth orbit.
Looks like they damaged the silo...
Life signs?
Captain?
In twenty-four hours, Zephram Cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test... from a missile silo in Montana. If I'm right, the Borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship.
And if they succeed, humans won't make First Contact with the Vulcans tomorrow. As First Officer I should be the one beaming down...
Good luck, sir.
Return to our own time?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. But Captain... are we... all going back?
Unless you'd like to stay.
Casualties are light, Captain. Minor buckling on the port nacelle. Nothing serious.
I have assigned two damage control teams to locate the source of our communication problems. So far, they've had no success.
A ship-wide decompression has been initiated!
What the hell is happening, Worf?
We saw at least thirty...and there are twenty-two Enterprise crewmembers reported missing... including Commander Data.
To control the Enterprise, they'll have to gain access to one of two locations. Main Engineering... or the Bridge.
What are they doing?
They're re-routing the deflector power conduits...
They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications...
We have to stop them from sending that message.
Agreed. Options?
You will have to realign the targeting array of the quantum torpedo... and reprogram the warhead for the localized detonation. There's only one torpedo left...
I guess I'd better get it right the first time.
Are you alright?
Just a little queasy...
Try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship.
Right.
And Commander, whatever you do... do <U>not</U> vomit in your exo-suit. It would be... unpleasant.
Worf! I'm going to need at least five minutes!
Report!
We've lost Bridge control!
Emergency override!
Report.
Someone...?
The Borg. Some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship. Seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields.
Wil... Data was down there.
All right... we've lost control of eight decks... three Cargo Bays... one Shuttlebay.
They're bypassing Engineering...
To do what? If they wanted a weapon, they could've taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay...
I remember it made me sick.
What are you suggesting?
I have to admit there was a moment there when --
Worf to Bridge.
Riker here.
Worf to Bridge. We're about to enter the Environmental Control Room.
Worf? Is something wrong?
What the hell happened down there, Worf?
No response. I'm not reading any Starfleet com traffic in this entire sector.
Captain, they're firing at a nuclear missile silo... in central Montana.
Are we in any danger of being detected by Earth defense systems?
Even Data?
They may be trying to send a message to the other Borg...the Borg in this time period...
Mr. President.
Admiral Donald...Bill...
Mr. President we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
I'd prefer not to be the President to push the button if I can avoid it.
The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be, Mr. President.
Good luck, Captain.
I believe the operation is over.
I'm going to perform surgery on a torpedo - you never know...
You may need assistance, doctor...
Bet you wish you'd stood in bed...
Spock, that was actually funny.
Calm yourself, doctor, the operation is almost complete...
Pity they're retiring us just as I was starting to understand you, Spock...
Or not to be -
Uh, Jim...
What the Hell's going on?
Sweet Jesus...! He's lost a lot of whatever this stuff is...
Can you - ?
No!
Thanks...
Figures.
Bones, why don't you see what you can do? Let them know we're not holding a grudge.
Three months till retirement. What a way to finish.
We're not finished.
- <U>Kobayashi Maru</U>...
Bones, are you afraid of the future?
That was the general idea I intended to convey.
I didn't mean this future.
Are we playing multiple choice?
Some people ARE afraid of the future; of what MIGHT happen; I was frightened, really frightened.
Specifically of...?
No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment. It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.
Well, don't be too hard on yourself - we all felt exactly the same -
Uh uh. Somebody felt much worse. And I'm starting to understand why.
What is it with you, anyway?
Still think we're finished?
What kind of creature is this? Last night you two were spooning -
Jim, leave me - I'm finished...
It's the viridium patch Spock slapped on my back right before we went aboard Gorkon's ship.
That cunning little Vulcan...
Once we're beyond the shield they should be able to pick it up two sectors away.
If they're even looking for us...
ARE YOU CRAZY?
Damned clever if you ask me...
ABSOLUTELY NOT!
Time we got underway ourselves, gentlemen. Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
And the good news is they're not going to prosecute.
Perhaps with a few small steps at a time. Like this one.
We're explorers not diplomats!
Captain, when we get to Camp Khitomer, how will we defend ourselves? I mean, if this new Bird of Prey can fire while she is invisible...?
This is fun...
Too bad we can't SMELL her.
They don't arrest people for having feelings.
Are you carrying a surgeon?
We were until your torpedoes!
Doctor McCoy, what is your current medical status?
For 27 years I have been Ship's Surgeon and later Chief Medical Officer aboard the USS Enterprise. In three months I'm due to stand down.
Stand...?
Retire.
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
Barely.
I didn't have the knowledge of Klingon anatomy I needed.
I was nervous -
You were incompetent! - whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink this court will determine.
I tried to save him! I was desperate to save him! He was the last best hope in the universe for real peace.
I don't believe we can get more out of the way than this.
They'll make it look like an accident...
What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?
They'll respect him now...
It takes a lot of effort.
I don't wonder. Stop me if I'm wrong but do we really have any way of knowing if this is the real you?
I've always wanted to meet you, Captain.
Would you care to go topside?
"To be or not to be, that is the question" which preoccupies our people, Captain Kirk. We need BREATHING room...
My God, what happened here?
You feign ignorance?
WHAT HAPPENED?
He's a DOCTOR!
Under article 184 of Interstellar Law, I place you both under arrest. You are charged with assassinating the Chancellor of the High Council.
He just tried to save him!
What?
Isn't it a fact that you served Romulan ale, a beverage illegal in the Federation because of its overwhelming potency?
And you still maintain your ship did not fire on Kronos One? Would you have known if she had? Come now, Captain. The record clearly there were no other ships in the sector.
There... were no other ships in the sector.
Did you have occasion to refer to your ship's data banks during that night?
I checked the data banks, yes.
And what did they tell you?
And now we come to the architect of this tragic affair, Captain James Tiberius Kirk. I put it to you, Captain, that you were seeking revenge for the death of your son.
That isn't true...!
Are those your words?
Yes.
Spoken by you?
Yes...
Louder, please. We cannot hear you.
You were demoted...
Yes.
For insubordination.
I have on occasion disobeyed orders.
You deny Enterprise fired on KRONOS One?
Well, I -
You deny that your men beamed aboard KRONOS One and shot the Chancellor?
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I did not witness.
Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?
I am.
As Captain I am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command.
Where is Mr. Sulu?
Captain, you're not going to show them the bridge??
Just the size of my head -
Torpedo room--?
Captain, if they fire at us with our shields down --
Get close enough to a man and you can kill him on "Stun" without setting off the alarm - of course you can't get rid of the body...
From Starfleet?
Where IS the conference?
She's here - somewhere.
But if she's cloaked...
Shields. Battle stations.
Mr. Chekov, take us forward, thrusters only, one half impulse power...
Mr. Chekov, slow down. Take us forward, thrusters only, one quarter impulse power.
Course heading, Captain?
They're preparing to fire.
You're forgetting something. the data banks say WE fired. If we did, the killers are here; if we didn't, whoever altered the data banks is here. Either way, what we're searching for is here...
What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?
Klingon blood.
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory.
Now we go to Starfleet?
Now we expand our search to include uniforms.
Mr. Spock, Rura Penthe's deep in Klingon territory. If we're discovered...
You must have cursed yourself, for having programmed our data banks, Lieutenant. Only they revealed something wrong aboard Enterprise.
Aye, sir.
Captain, I'm getting a message from Klingon High Command.
An INCIDENT?
Do we report this, sir?
Send to commander Enterprise: "We stand ready to assist you. Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior." Attach our co-ordinates.
This is KRONOS One. I am Chancellor Gorkon.
Chancellor. We've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting place on Earth.
Thank you, Captain.
We'd be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
Chancellor, may I present Commander Spock, whom I believe you know, Dr. Leonard McCoy, chief medical officer, Montgomery Scott, chief engineer...
Your research laboratory is most impressive...
Starfleet's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres. All vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors...
Thank you, Captain Kirk. The evening has been most... edifying.
I've heard of chameloids - "Shapeshifters" - I thought you were mythical.
An accident wasn't good enough...
Your friends are late...
Isn't it about time you became something else?
What took you so long?
Kill him! He's the one!!
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.
He's got it.
And your coat.
Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway.
How did you know...?
We don't get many presidential assassins.
We didn't kill Gorkon.
How much time's left of your sentence?
That's not his knee. Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain.
When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.
Listen. No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
Except us.
I know how to get outside the shield.
Where do we come in?
Getting outside the shield is easy. After that it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze. Can you?
Possibly.
I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
Maybe if their particles just got a wee bit mixed...
Stand down your weapons.
Captain, if --
Stand DOWN, Mr. Scott. All stop. That's an order.
This is incredible -
As you were. Lieutenant...?
Aft thrusters -
Thank you. Lieutenant, one quarter impulse power...
Aye, sir.
Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant.
Kronos, sir?
I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.
Sorry -
Come on, Saavik, you COULD knock -
We're almost at the rendezvous - I thought you'd want to know...
I gather you are not enthusiastic about the assignment... I don't think many on board are.
You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant -
I always wanted to try that.
Uhura, hailing frequencies. Right standard rudder, bring us alongside...
I hope you're happy.
Saavik, you know anything about a neutron energy surge?
Sir?
Captain, our shields -- !
Who is "US?"
I won't allow Starfleet to be dismantled over some Klingon promises.
Just the prototype.
This is Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior.
Sulu!
Standing by, Captain Kirk.
You understand that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations, Captain.
I'm sorry, Captain - your message is breaking up.
Bless you, Sulu. Where's the peace conference? They're going to attempt another assassination.
The Conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border. I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.
I'm afraid we may need more than that. There's a Bird of Prey on the lookout for us. And she can fire while she's cloaked.
Surely not.
I'm getting underway now. But you should know, I'm in alpha Quadrant. The chances of my reaching the conference in time are slim.
When does this conference start?
According to my information, today.
Thank you, Captain Sulu.
Me?
I have personally vouched for you in this matter, Captain.
WE volunteered?
There's an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon could go to China.
How could you vouch for me? That's... ... arrogant presumption -
I was asked by my father to open neg-
I know your father's the Vulcan Ambassador for heaven's sake, but you know how I feel about this: they're animals.
Jim, there is an historic opportunity here -
DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
They're dying.
Lieutenant, I am pleased to see you. The Lieutenant is the first Vulcan to be graduated at the top of her class as the Academy.
Never been this close.
I believe the Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace -
I don't believe our own conduct will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy...
What is it?
I am uncertain.
Spock, I'm really tired...
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
Where?
Curiously it appears to emanate from us.
What the -
We HAVEN'T fired -
I am responsible for involving you in this. I will go.
I'M going. You are going to be responsible for getting me out of this. Meantime we're not going to be the instigators of a full-scale war on the eve of universal peace.
Captain...
The Klingons have a new weapon: a Bird of Prey that can fire while cloaked. She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
The peace conference.
What peace conference?
I've been dead before. Uhura, raise Excelsior. She ought to have the co-ordinates.
Why would they give them to us?
Are you dining on worms?
You were right: it was arrogant presumption that got us into this situation. You might have died.
I was blind. I couldn't see past the death of my son. I couldn't trust.
I too was blind. I knew about HER - and I did nothing. I trusted too much.
You couldn't have known she was listening the night I dictated that entry into my log. You were proud of her achievements as a Vulcan.
I was PREJUDUCED by those achievements.
Can we two have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness? Would that constitute a joke?
Someone said the difference between comic and cosmic is the letter "S." You haven't outlived your usefulness - to me. And you are not responsible just because she is also Vulcan -
I SHOULD have been -
Not for the actions of another. No one is responsible for any actions but his own. Human beings -
But I am not human. I am only -
Close enough to beam down?
Captain, perhaps we're going about this the wrong way; our job is to get to the conference; HER job will be to stop us.
What's she waiting for?
But we haven't run out of history just yet. Your father quoted Hamlet: he called the future - "the undiscovered country"...
I always assumed Hamlet meant death.
The only way to find out if a man's trustworthy...
Control tower, reading, Sir.
Channel open, Captain.
Captain --
WE SURRENDER.
It's pretty chaotic over there. There's been some weapons fire and a lot of shouting...
Gorkon's own man??
Uhura?
Captain, we can't see her, but she gives off heat...
You have done well, Saavik. As your sponsor at the Academy I have followed your career with... satisfaction. And as a Vulcan.
Sir, I speak to you as a kindred intellect. Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
You must have faith.
Faith...?
But we can't allow them to be taken back to Kronos as prisoners.
How did you - ?
Her own father...?
Any reply from Starfleet to our dispatch, Lieutenant.
Not as yet, sir.
Curious. You haven't been assisting Commander Uhura with her radio transmissions, have you, Lt?
Commander Uhura has been experiencing technical difficulties sir.
Very well. For twenty-four hours we'll agree that this conversation did not take place.
A lie?
Any progress?
We've got a crew of three hundred turning their own quarters inside out, but the killers may be among them. Surely they've disposed of these boots by now. Wouldn't it have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?
Suppose when they returned they threw the boots into the garbage?
A lie?
If you are logical.
I don't want to.
But it was when you tried to persuade me the Captain was guilty that I should have understood.
Perhaps neither of us was hearing very well that night, Lieutenant. There were things I tried to tell you too - about having faith.
Direct hit -
Trouble?
We've been ordered to -
In nineteenth century France, workers who felt their livelihood threatened by machines, flung their wooden shoes - called SABOTS - into the gears to stop them. Hence the word SABOTAGE.
We can send a message to Starfleet Command -
Sorry to wake you, sir, but Starfleet urgently requests any data we may have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
What?
Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.
Sir?
You having hearing problems, mister?
According to this we've completed our exploration of the entire sector.
Fifty-four planets - and their gaseous atmospheric anomalies. Our sensing and analytic equipment worked well.
I have an energy wave from 240 degrees mark six port --
Don't tell me that was any meteor shower.
Negative. The subspace shockwave originated at bearing three-two- three, mark seven-five, the location is... Praxis. A Klingon moon. Barren of indigenous life forms but -
I have confirmed the location, sir, but...
What is it?
Praxis?
At least we must keep track of where they are taken, sir. I -
NO WAY!
It's as I said, Mr. Spock: Inventory still registers every torpedo.
Yet the data banks insist we fired: twice. One computer is lying.
A computer canna lie, sir.
I think not.
You can check the torpedoes visually, if you like -
We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
That could take hours!
Nevertheless.
And if they're still in place?
They don't place the same value on life that we do, Spock - you know that... take my word: she didn't shed one bloody tear...
Twenty-four hours from now we won't have a clue where the Captain is.
They dinna fire on themselves. And there were no other ships present.
There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
Too far off. Very near us. Perhaps... underneath us...
If another ship had been beneath us the Klingons would've seen her!
A Bird of Prey canna fire when she's cloaked!
This one can.
They you're talking about a dreadful new engine of destruction, Mr. Spock.
- could take weeks, sir.
They're outside the beaming shield. Mr. Scott, start your engines.
They're naturally wary, ma'am. We've been at war a long time.
I assume command of this ship as of 0130 hours. Uhura, send to Starfleet HQ. Explain precisely what has taken place, and request instructions.
Sulu's giving us his position and telling us he's standing by...
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible whatever remains - however improbable - must be the truth.
What exactly does that mean?
And they'd be right. We have no evidence - just a theory that happens to fit the facts...
Even assuming you're correct, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own President?
I've pulled out my - uh wooden shoe and Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
You understand that we have lost all contact with Captain Kirk...?
I don't think Starfleet could have envisioned our current predicament.
Under impulse power she expends fuel like any other ship. We call it "Plasma" - I do not know the Klingon name for it, but by any name it is merely ionized gas.
They might as well arrest me, too; I felt like Lieutenant Saavik.
Can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you?
Fuzzy face is gone.
Yes, please continue.
Do you know who I am?
You are me.
Do you know where you are?
Can you remember our father?
Do you know the name of the Captain of this vessel?
No.
Brother. I cannot move.
No, I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines.
Why?
Because you are dangerous.
Why?
You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
I do not understand.
Do you know anything about Shinzon's plans against the Federation?
No.
Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
No. Can I move now?
No. I must deactivate you.
For how long?
Indefinitely.
I notice Dr. Crusher laughing along with the rest of you. As most of you know, the doctor will also soon be leaving the Enterprise, to assume command of Starfleet Medical. Again, I'm forced to ask, Beverly, have you considered what you're doing to little ole me?! I'll probably get some old battle-axe of a doctor who'll tell me to eat my vegetables and
Sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath, isn't it?
Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.
When was he... created?
About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.
It has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level. I can't overestimate the danger of Thalaron radiation, Jean Luc. A microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds.
Beverly, come in.
Remember him?
He was a bit proud as I recall.
He was a damn fool. Selfish and ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning.
I so wanted to believe Shinzon. But the Thalaron radiation can't be explained away. Whatever he's after, it's not peace.
Is he very much like you were?
Jean Luc, Whatever you were... Right now you're the man you've made yourself. He's someone else.
Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels, you're completely normal.
The more I studied his DNA the more confusing it got. Finally I could only come to one conclusion... Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing. He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly, so he could replace you.
But the Romulans abandoned the plan.
As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. Remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. He was engineered to skip thirty years of life. But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. He's dying.
How long does he have?
But we do have one advantage. He needs your blood to live. He might come after you first.
To seek out new life and new civilizations. Zephyr. Cochrans own words. When Charles Darwin set out on the H.M.S. Beagle, on his journey into the unknown... he sailed without a single musket.
That was another time.
You can' t imagine them, Jean Luc. They're kids! All with advance degrees in xenobiology and out to conquer every disease in the quadrant.
Reminds me of a young doctor I used to know...
They're running me ragged. Nothing but question day and night... I love it! Come to dinner and 1'1 tell you all about it. There's a Bajoran band at the officer's mess.
Not tonight, I have work here.
So... To happy endings.
Sir. I noticed an interesting confluence of emotion at the wedding. I am familiar with the human concept of tears through laughter and its inverse, laughter through tears, but I could not help wondering about the human capacity for expressing both pleasure and sadness simultaneously.
I understand why it would seem confusing. Certain human rituals... like weddings, birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions. These rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time.
And you were particularly aware of this feeling because Commander Riker will be leaving to assume command of the Titan?
Will and Deanna joining the Titan. Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical...
And this makes you "sad"?
Well. I suppose it does a bit. I'm very happy for them, of course, but I'm going to miss them. The ship will seem... incomplete without them.
That is because you have a familiarity with them. You can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge.
The choices I made have led me here as well. This is the only home I have ever known. I cannot foresee a reason for leaving.
If I were... I believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior. I would "miss you."
Now, you make a toast.
To new worlds...
The closest signature is two kilometers to the west... that direction, sir.
The final signature is approx- imately 300 meters up that incline.
He is very observant.
Data!
Starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record. We can infer he is relatively young and a capablecommander. He fought seventeen major engagements in the war. All successful. Beyond that, we know nothing.
Data to Captain Picard. Geordi and I have identified the source of the unauthorized computer access. And, I believe, we have also discovered an opportunity to gain a tactical advantage.
My mission was a success, sir. I have discovered the source of the Thalaron radiation.
Good work. The download?
A bit less florid, Data.
A weapon.
Geordi equipped me with the prototype for the Emergency Transport Unit. I recommend you use it to return to the Enterprise.
It'll only work for one of us.
Yes, sir.
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
Alacrity would be appreciated, Commander.
They are trying to override the access codes. Reman is really a most complex language with pictographs representing certain verb roots and...
What do you imagine this is?
Can you open the shuttlebay doors?
Affirmative, sir. Negative, sir. They have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals.
Do you think this is a wise course of action?
We're about to find out... Power up disruptors and fire on my mark.
Ready, Captain.
How long until we reach the fleet?
"For now we see but through a glass darkly..." He said he's a mirror.
Of you?
Yes.
I do not agree. Although you share the same genetic structure, the events of your life have created unique individual.
But so much is the same. On a biological level he is... and I will not accept the idea that there is nothing I can do. I have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him.
He would deny a "human" connection is possible. He considers himself entirely Reman.
He may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin
No, sir, it is not possible. The B-9 is physically identical to me, although his neural pathways are not as advanced. But even if they were, he would not be me.
How can you be sure?
We are passing through the Bassen Rift. The projections will return when we have cleared it.
It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?
Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications.
We are losing dorsal shields.
Captain, we have lost ventral shielding on deck twenty nine.
We are being hailed.
Sir, allow me to go. You are needed here.
Negative.
Why am I looking at me?
You are not looking at your- self. You are looking at me.
You have a red shirt.
This is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
Why?
Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle.
Since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself, it is logical to theorize that there is an android such as myself on Kolarus III.
How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
Isolated pockets of humanoids. It appears to be a pre-warp civilization at an early stage of industrial development.
Well, he seems to have the same internal mechanics as Data but not as much positronic develop- ment. The neural pathways aren't nearly as sophisticated. Id say he's a prototype. Something Dr. Soong created before Data .
At present he serves no useful function. Dr. Soong created us to become active and useful members of society. I do not believe he would have wanted the B-9 to live out his life in his present state.
I can't believe the Captain went along with a memory download.
Captain Picard agrees that the B-9 was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself. If my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix, he should have all my abilities.
He'd have all your memories too. You feel comfortable with that?
I feel nothing, Geordi. It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual.
An individual more like you, you mean.
Yes.
What purpose does this serve?
It seems to be a redundant memory port. Maybe it's for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload?
Dr. Soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions.
It's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing. Mind if I keep him here and run some diagnostics?
But I believe he will prove incapable of performing higher functions.
Don't give up hope, Data. I know, I know, you're not capable of hope.
We have lost structural integrity on decks twelve through seventeen, sections four through ten.
What is our approximate distance?
It appears to be... ... an arm.
Why is it moving?
It's you.
No.
If you wouldn't mind.
Really, Captain, it was a lovely toast.
The least I could do for you, Deanna. Besides, you know me... Im a talking head.
And you needn't worry. I'll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know.
May I have this dance?
Counselor.
Do you have a moment, sir?
It's about Data I've watched him with the B-9 and I'm troubled. Data's desire for a "family" is very strong. I'm afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9.
You're speaking of emotional investment?
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.
As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.
I'm going to miss you.
I would say he's been trained to resist telepathy. What I could sense of his emotions were erratic, very hard to follow.
Is he sincere about wanting peace?
Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you. The same way you want to know him.
How could I not?
Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him.
Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. I've become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties.
How can you be certain?
Captain -- I might have a way to find them.
Counselor?
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.
But how can he? He'll kill you.
I'm only half human.
Imzadi. This is so good.
He can never know you as I know you... He can never touch you as I touch you.
This isn't real.
I'll always be with you now. Now and forever.
You're not here.
No.
Captain Picard, Commander Donatra of the Warbird Valdore. Might we be of assistance?
Your timing is impeccable, Commander.
The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.
I'm afraid that drink will have to wait, Captain.
Do you have life support?

Open a channel.
This is Commander Donatra of the Valdore. We're dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies.
It's very faint but I've isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system.
What do we know about the planet?
Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.
I read six distinct positronic signatures, spread out over a few kilometers on the surface.
Cannon fodder.
It's going to take some time to find out -- the data stream was rerouted through substations all over the ship.
What programs were accessed?
That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations. It's not even restricted material.
Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready.
I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical.
Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
It's called a Cascading Bio- genic Pulse. The unique properties of Thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits. Depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship... or a planet.
He's getting his cloak back. We have exhausted our compliment of photon torpedoes. Phaser banks are down to four percent.
What's he doing?
He thinks he knows exactly what I'm going to do.
Sir?
Geordi, put 211 power to the engines. Take it from life support if you have to -- everything you can give me.
Aye, sir.
Deanna, on my mark.
How long until he can fire?
Prepare for a site-to-site transport.
Sir, we wont be able to bring you back. Its a one way trip. Captain, I don't know if the transporter...
You have the bridge, Commander. Use all available power to move away from the Scimitar. Now, Mister La Forge.
Sir, we're being hailed.
Geordi... prepare the shuttle- bay for arrivals. They don't know our procedures so just... open the doors.
I'll take care of it, sir.
Admiral Janeway. Good to see you.

With or without the rest of the fleet?
A diplomatic mission. We've been invited, believe it or not. Seems there's been some kind of internal political shakeup. The new Praetor, someone called Shinzon, has requested a Federation envoy.
New Praetor?
Believe me, we don't under- stand it either. You're the closest ship so I want you to high tail it over there and hear what he has to say. Get the lay of the land, If the Empire becomes unstable, it could mean trouble for the entire quadrant.
Understood.

Not with the Romulans.

Just lucky, Admiral.
Enterprise. We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar.
Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
So, human... you've met your better self!
What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
I'm preparing her for Shinzon. To sooth him as she soothes you. To stand at his side as she does at yours.
That will never happen.
It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest.
There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
I won't do it.
Wont do what, Mister Worf?
Captain. I think it is inappropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear... Naked.
I'm picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the Kolarin system.
To find the head, sir?
Sir, I recommend we raise shields.
No!
Captain!
Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.
We're being hailed.
Sir, we've had an unauthorized access into the main computer.
Worf, prepare a full phaser spread, zero elevation. All banks on my mark. Scan for shield impacts and stand by photon torpedoes.
Sir, we're being hailed.
Coordinate our attack with the Valdore's tactical officer. Triangulate fire on any shield impacts.
Captain, the Hemingway has arrived to tow us to spacedock.
What's this?
Diverting to the Kolarin system takes us awfully close to the Romulan Neutral Zone.
I think it's worth a look. Don't worry, Number One, we'll get you to Betazed with time to spare.
Thank you, sir...
Captain, I hope I don't have to remind you --
I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try out the Argo.
Sir --
Captain, you have an Alpha Priority communication from Starfleet Command.
We have to assume he had Romulan collaborators.
A coup d'etat?
Why don't they answer our hails?
It's an old psychological strategy, Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.
It's working.
Captain, with all due respect to diplomatic protocols -- the Federation Council's not sitting out here, we are.
She's not out for a pleasure cruise.
Not very chatty.
He wasn't designed to live a complete, human life span.
Sir?
His hatred of the Federation is apparent. He would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason. He is going after Earth.
Oh boy. Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled.
Strength in numbers?
Report.
Counselor Troi, report to the bridge.
Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark.
The Titan's a fine ship, will. And she's getting a captain worthy of her.
But she's not the Enterprise.
I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?
Anything.
When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.
Serving with you has been an honor.
I hope you'll forgive the darkness... we're not comfortable in the light.
And you're not as we imagined you.
Praetor?
I am, Commander Riker... May I touch your hair?
On the world I come from there's no light. No sun. Beauty isn't important. I see now there's a world elsewhere.
Praetor Shinzon. Were not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
Yes, I'm sorry, Captain. There's so much we have to talk about.
I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
I want to end the centuries of mistrust. I want to be your ally, not your enemy. As a first step I propose we eliminate the Neutral Zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas.
And the Senate supports you?
Right now, youre thinking this all sounds too good to be true?
Yes.
But you're also thinking the chance for peace is too promising to ignore. Above allyou're trying to decide if you can trust me.
Yes.
No one knew what to do. Finally I was taken to a doctor who had some experience with Terran illnesses and I was finally diagnosed with Shalaft's syndrome. Do you know of it, Captain?
We need to talk, just you and I.
Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow. Just the two of us. Or just the one of us.
You know I need to verify this.
And when I was ready they were going to replace you with me, an exact biological duplicate. Put a Romulan agent at the heart of Starfleet to.influence your command structure. It was a bold plan.
What happened?
Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.
It's not quite the face you remember.
Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
A lifetime of violence will do that. My nose was broken four times. And my jaw... But so much is the same. The eyes, you recognize the eyes.
Yes. The eyes have it.
Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they? Yours are so confident.
How did you end up on Remus?
For thousands of years the Romulan Senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sister-planet... But the time has come for us to live as equals.
You're doing this to liberate the Remans?
You don't trust me.
I have no reason to.
Of course you do. If you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people... youd be sitting where I am now. At least I hope you would.
And if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great respons- ibility in representing the Federation. I can't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions.
I want to know where I come from. The Remans gave me a future. You can tell me about my past.
There's so much, and so much of it is dull...
Were we always explorers?
No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth. It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life...
Looking up at the stars.
Yes.
And you dreamed about what was up there. About...
After you, Praetor.
So I'm not as tall as you expected?
I always hoped I would hit two meters.
With a full head of hair.
Shinzon... I'm trying to believe you.
I know.
If there's one ideal the Federation holds most dear it's that all men, all races, can be united. From the first time the Vulcans came to Earth we've sought a future of peace. Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friend- ship. In time. When trust has been earned.
In time, Jean Luc.
Hello, Jean Luc.
Why am I here?
What are you doing?
All of this so you could capture me?
Maybe I'll train it to do little tricks for me like your robot does. Or maybe Ill snap its ugly head off.
What's this all about?
It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...
You're not Reman.
And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see? Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?
I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.
I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be.
I won't defend my life to you.
My life is meaningless as long as you're alive. What am I while you exist? A shadow? An enigma?
If your issues are with me... This has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the Federation.
Oh, but it does. We will no longer bow like slaves before anyone. Not the Romulans and not your mighty Federation. We're a race bred for war. For conquest.
Think about what you're doing, Shinzon. Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?
It amazes me how little you know yourself.
I'm incapable of such an act, and so are you.
You can't trace my holographic emitters, Captainn. So don't bother. And you can't contact Starfleet. We're quite alone.
We are.
It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.
Why are you here?
To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.
And what of the Enterprise?
I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain. If the Enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years, it will not be harmed.
You know that's not possible.
I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.
I know you as well as I know myself, Shinzon. There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.
Long ago.
Not so long.
Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.
The man who is Jean Luc Picard and Shinzon of Remus won't exterminate the population of an entire planet! He is better than that!
Yes.
So if I gave you my life, what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? A father's words you never heard? Could you do that?
I don't know.
That's your life... not mine.
Please.
Its too late.
You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!
I hope you're still alive, Jean Luc.
I am.
Praetor, we've received the transponder signal.
Report!
Target disruptors. Destroy them.
Deploy the weapon. Kill everything on that ship. Then set a course for Earth.
What about Picard?
Our greater goal is more important, brother.
Well, that sounds relaxing too.
So theyve got him up and running.
He's a very unusual android.
My God...
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.
Believe it or not, I think the cavalry has arrived.
Intruder alert!
Are we prepared?
This is a mistake.
He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.
The bond is broken.
Find her again.
No -- this is wasting time.
It's accelerating. You have no more time for games.
How long?
How long until we reach the Rift?
Let her pursue -- drop cloak on the aft port quadrant and prepare for full emergency stop.
What?!
Praetor...
What is it?!! Focus on your job!!
Join us, Commanders. Now what's the disposition of the fleet?
They're holding position.
And?
They will obey, Praetor.
How many Warbirds will you need?
Praetor. You have the whole fleet at your disposal. They supported the coup, they'll follow you.
The Scimitar will serve my needs.
But surely...
Then I don't understand the reason for the delay!
You don't have to understand.
And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve?
I have a purpose.
Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?
You must learn patience, Commander. Do you know where I learned it? In the dilithium mines of Remus. Spend eighteen hours every day under the ash of a Romulan guards whip and you'll soon understand patience.
Praetor.
The Enterprise is immaterial! They won't make it back to Federation space.

I thought we discussed patience, Commander.
Commander Suran, the games are over. In two days the Federation will be crippled beyond repair. Does that satisfy you?
For the moment.
Benny, God, take it easy...
Right in line with that burning tree.
I don't see anything.
Benny, there's nothing there.
There is. They came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses.
What did I tell you?
Don't you think you should call a backup?
Mike, call for back-up. Benny, you all right?
I don't think so...
Gate three. It's boarding now.
Thank you.
What can I do for you folks?
How much are your rooms?
You have one with two beds?
Sure.
I'll take that.
Fill this out. Will this be cash or credit card?
Credit card.
I'll have to run your card off now.
We're only going to be here a few hours...
Do you have a good map of Death Valley?
Food. Eat. I prepare food. I work as a cook. That's how I make money.
I understand.
What do you do?
I make maps.
Hey, that sounds interesting. You like it?
Eh... yes.
Make any money?
No.
Do you have children?
No.
What do you think of America?
Well, here we are... You go down that ramp there, you're sure to get a ride.
Thank you.
No!!! No!!!
Where did you stop last?
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Where did you stop last?
Stay right there...
What was your last stop?
Elmo's...
Where's that?
We're going... Damn! We'll tell the press that there was an accident. Chemical warfare spill. That cover cannot be violated in any way. Understand me, Shermin?
Major Bell here, sir. We have to tell these people that we're friendly. That this whole thing was a mistake. Is anyone trying to contact the ship?
Recognize this?
It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes.
Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
It's real, George.
There's no mistake? You're absolutely sure?
I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and...
Is there any possibility that it's a hoax? Could you be mistaken?
None. And there's another one in the area that's alive. I don't know if it's the only one. I don't know if it was left here by accident or it's part of an inva...
Get the body out of there. Load it on the Air Force chopper and get it to Wright Patterson. They'll take it from there... We didn't expect this, Shermin.
We'll need a lot of help, George. You could hide an army up here.
I'm going to the White House right now. I'll try and get you everything you need.
Contain it and get back to me.
Then it's not an accident that they found us.
We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
Not necessarily bad! If they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?
We'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for.
That's not going to happen, George, unless you get us the help you promised us.
We've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this time.
Don't let them do it this way, George. It's too important. We can't find this thing alone.
George, we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial.
When can we expect containment?
Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang...
It's in a green Mustang?
Why did you let it get into a populated area?
It's taken on a disguise.
Clarify that.
The extraterrestrial now looks like this.
You sure you want this, because... that's putting an awful lot of faith in people we have no control over...
I'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk.
I don't like it, George...
Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?
It's messy... the thing's got a gun... We're just asking for somebody to get killed...
We don't know what else to do. We need results.
You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.
We're growing very concerned back here. There's no use pretending otherwise. We're rapidly approaching a 'condition red.' People are beginning to ask difficult questions.
I'll make this as simple as I can, George. They disappeared.
I don't care where you're from you just can't disappear into thin air.
George, listen to what you're saying. This thing's changed itself into a man. Disappearing may not be that big a deal.
Maybe... look, this is just something to think about... from what I got at the shopping center, it was more scared than anything else... I don't feel it's as big a threat as you think it is...
Is that what's affecting your performance?
I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it.
Hello George.
Shermin...
What's all this for?
We have a new directive. I'm taking over.
We don't have to do it that way. We can catch him this time.
Washington thinks it's too late for that.
I've never been taken off an assignment in my life. Give me twenty- four hours and I'll have him for you.
You're not hearing me.
You can change a directive, George. You've done it before. Listen to me. He's going somewhere in Death Valley. Lathrop Wells was never anything but a bus stop. East is the nuclear site. There are no roads in there. She was teaching him to hitchhike. I'm telling you. We block the four roads into Death Valley and we got him.
We'll do that. But how are we going to hold him? He can change himself into a man. He can disappear.
That's the chance we have to take.
No, we don't.
Then you're going to have to do it without me.
You're a career intelligence officer, Shermin. You'll be in the air with us.
No deal.
George... Do you hear me, George?
What?
I just retired.
Mrs. Haydn...
This is George Fox...
I want to speak to Marc Shermin.
You can speak to me, Mrs. Haydn. I'm in charge of this operation now.
If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up.
I won't let anyone hurt you.
This is Marc Shermin. Where are you, Mrs. Haydn?
I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.
You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.
Is the man who kidnapped you there now?
I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.
Mr... I'm sorry, what was your name again?
Marc Shermin.
Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up now. If you want to ask me any questions, call me at home in a couple of days. I'm in the book.
Mrs. Haydn...
He doesn't want to hurt anybody. Please leave him alone.
Please...
Please.
Please...
What?
Ah... no...
Steering wheel...
Steering wheel.
Steering wheel.
Gear shift.
Gear shift.

Eh... police.
Steering wheel... gear shift... dashboard...
Good.
Which way?

Pancakes.

Money.
Mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens... Jennyhaydn... Money?
What?
Smile.
Smile... good?
What?!
Minneapolis.
Minneapolis... Minneapolis...
Minneapolis... good.
No gas.
No gas.
No gas... car dead. We need gas. I don't want to get shot for running out of gas.
Gas good?
Go.
It's closed... closed. We need one that's open.
Closed?
What?
Who is he? Who is she? Who are you? Who am I? Who are you?
I am Jenny Haydn.
Who are you?
That's a big help. Where are you from?
From?
Are you from up there? Space?
Space?
Gas.
No gas.
Who?
My... husband.
I am husband?
Shit.
Shit?
No, no... don't say that. Bad word.
Shit... shit... what shit?
Who?
Attendant. He'll give us gas. Put the gun down. Under the seat. Under the seat...
No.
In your pocket, please...
You. Mouth closed.
Satisfied? Now get out. Out.
Money.
What?
What is... ...Coke?
A drink.
I...
You want to try it?
I want to try it.
What's the matter?
Horses.
What?
That was a red light!! I told you you have to stop at a red light!!
It was yellow.
I will see it next time.
Why are you going here? What is here?
When do you have to be here?
I do not understand.
Sun...
Yes.
Sun... day. No sun... night. You understand?
Yes. Day... night.
How many days and nights do you have to go... ...here?
Three nights... two days.
That's not much time. I'll just slow you down. I have to sleep. I'm very tired. And I have to wash and eat. You don't...
I need you.
I won't tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I promise. You'll keep...
No.
You'll keep the car. I'll take a bus... Am I going up there with you... in your ship... up there?
No.
Then let me go. You don't need me.
No.
Do you understand what I'm saying to you? You can keep the car. That should be enough for gas from here to there. Please let me go.
The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells...
Is that a baby?
Yes.
A baby is a new person?
Eh... yes...
Do you have a baby?
No... The closest...
Why?
I'd love to have a baby. But I can't...
Why?
But I must go here.
I know that. But the buses don't go there.
What is hitchhike?
Say it.
'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
The driver will...
But I speak English.
Will you please do it my way? You'll get into trouble if you don't. If anybody talks to you, tell them... I do not speak English.
I do not speak English.
Right. In Omaha the driver will put you on the bus for Salt Lake City and the new driver will take... ...this part. When you get to Salt Lake City, ask the driver, 'Las Vegas, please'...
'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike?
You want this ticket?
Yes.
'Lathrop Wells, please. I do not speak English.'
Your thumb tells the driver that you want a ride.
The car will stop?
When do I get to Lathrop Wells?
Don't worry. They're not going to hurt you. Come on. Only show this to the driver. Nobody else. And don't lose it.
Can I have the gun?
Don't be afraid. Do what I told you and you'll be okay.
Well... I'm going to go now.
Go?
Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me... Goodbye.
Jennyhaydn.
Yes?
Goodbye.
What?
What happened?
Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth?
You thought we were a different planet?!
No. My ship was doing a map of all the suns and...
Stars... When a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.'
We were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship. My... eh... we kidnapped it. On it there was a map that said how to come to Earth. This was very important. Before then, we thought we were the only people in all the stars.
You did? That's funny. So did we.
Yes?
Yes.
We told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. Just to look from up there. We came and... the driver of my ship...
The captain...
The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed.
Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend?
I don't understand 'friend.'
A friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with...
He was a good friend... The captain took the ship away fast and I was not in the ship.
The police shouldn't have started shooting. But you can hardly blame them. You surprised them. They didn't know you were up there. When they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us.
I understand.
Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.
What is hell?
It's bad.
What are you doing?
Are you my friend?
Yes.
Nobody knows.
Why?
I like this music.
I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
Do you have music up there?
Yes.
I'd like to hear it. Can you sing something?
I do not want to.
I am not a good singer.
That was beautiful.
You liked my singing?
Put that back.
You shouldn't drink so much of that stuff. It's bad for you.
On the radio they say it's good.
The machine gave me two. Should I put one back?
No. Get in.
You can have one.
Are you angry at me?
I told you goodbye. Why are you here?
The police are waiting for you up ahead. There's a roadblock. You have to go back.
This car will take me to Las Vegas. I cannot go back.
If I don't meet the ship, my people will go home without me.
Please understand. If you go this way, you'll never get to your ship. The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. I'll get you to your ship. I promise.
I will go. But not you.
You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
I don't want you to be hurt.
Where are you going?
I must meet my ship.
Why can't we wait here for a ride?
I feel better if I move.
Asshole!!
Where did you learn that?
We're not going to get a ride tonight.
I can't stay on this planet.
No one's traveling in this weather.
You promised you would get me to my ship.
I will. I will. We still have another day.
You promised.
What are you saying?
You can stop. I will go on alone.
Why don't you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late?
I used the last one to jump off the cliff...
Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.
You are cold.
You're damn right I am.
What?
Good morning.
Horses.
You don't forget anything, do you?
Hello... hello. How are you this morning?
Do they talk?!
No, they don't talk... We talk to them.
Oh, you're pretty...
They are beautiful.
Yes, they are.
You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn. You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one.
But...
It will be human and it will look like this. But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have.
I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby.
The cowboys were right. You can make money fast gambling.
May I have twenty-five cents, please?
What for?
Here are two quarters. When you lose these, you're not going to get anymore.
This is crazy. We don't have time for this.
I know how to gamble now.
You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship.
I want to get money for you and the baby.
I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
Inflation, tuition, college. Children are damned expensive. I know.
The cook again?
Yes.
It'll tell you pretty much everything about us...
This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
Any words you don't know you can find in the dictionary.
I understand.
It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.
What will you say about us?
I will say that we can be friends.
This is yours...
If you want to keep it, you can.
Would you put some of your singing in this for the baby?
You want the baby to laugh at me.
How long will it take you to get home?
I'm sure we could find a country and western station.
There.
The yellow one.
Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When the baby is born, we'll go out in my back yard and wave to you.
Where do you think you're going?
Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.
Well...
What do I do now?
I love you.
I'm never going to see you again, am I?
Tell the baby about me.
I will.
Help me!!
You could have killed us both!!
Jesus Christ!! You crazy people...
Call the police!!
Help me!!!
Oh God, man... don't shoot me... My mistake... I'm sorry...
You sure this is your car?
My grandmother's rich.
Slow down, slow down.
I told you I'm looking for someone.
In the cars, too?!
I don't know where he is.
They after you?
What? No, of course not.
I'm telling you, you're going to find him at the roadblock, or right after, or not at all.
If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
The five-fifty. We already passed it. But it'll take him way out of his way.
Pull over. I've got to get back there.
Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody.
Wait. Could I have your autograph?
I have nothing to do. I'd like to help you.
Is it for real?
Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow.
This is crazy. What were we going to do if that had been the ship? We have two thirty calibre machine guns, three M16's and some handguns.
That's because the ones that were hurt, died. They couldn't talk to you.
Good... It looks like we might be the welcoming committee, so I think we should try and figure out what we're gonna do if we have to come face to face with this creature.
Bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.
I know. She bought him a ticket for Lathrop Wells and put him on the bus. He didn't stay on though and they drove off together.
Doesn't make sense.
Tell him I'm not here.
You get that, Lyman?
I'm telling you they're probably friendly.
They're gonna let some local cop blow him away.
Save us all a lot of trouble.
Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.
Bullshit!
You have no conception of this, do you?
This has always been my favorite time of day.
Very beautiful country up here...
Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
Can you see under the faceplate?
There's a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then...
We had a flight of F16's play tag with the spaceship over Michigan for an hour. Then it shot straight up and disappeared.
Was there visual contact?
No, sir. Radar.
After I called in, I had a chance to sit down with the three locals. They swear there's another one that didn't make the ship... It might be alive.
People have made mistakes in these situations before.
Oh, Jesus.
There's nothing... No reports of sightings or landings or anything... in the other parts of the country or overseas... Seems like a totally isolated incident.
It was only an accident that we discovered them.
You married, Major?
Twenty-eight years.
To the same woman?
Yes.
How would you describe the sounds we heard coming out of that thing's helmet?
It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?
Listen to this. A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...
It was a man though... right?
Nothing up there... The grass is matted down in a few places, but that could have been anything.
Where are you going?
Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.
I don't understand.
Good job, neither do I. What do you do for a living?
I don't understand.
I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'
I told you...
Judy, that's stupid.
Well, maybe these men won't think so. We were asleep when a helicopter woke me up. It made me so nervous I went into the kitchen for something to eat. I happened to look out the window and there was Scott Haydn with this green thing draped over his arm pulling Jenny down the walk to the car.
You know that's impossible!
I know what I saw. I've seen him enough times.
Is there a reward in this?
Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't
Because I'm the one who called the police, you know.
Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that.
Hey, it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard... You want my opinion, it's the girl. She had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid.
You saw that?
Eh... the store tells you to call when there's trouble, so they won't get sued... But that shouldn't matter if there's a reward, right?
I wouldn't think so.
That's what I thought. So remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late, you know.
Hello...
I must get to my ship, Mr. Shermin.
We can't let you do that.
All the roads into Death Valley are blocked. We'd like to talk to you.
If I talk to you, I will miss my ship.
Yeah, that's right.
I saw you play, man. You were good. Like a fucking freight train I remember saying. So what happened, injuries or what?
Bullshit politics.
It's always politics. Like this thing we're in here, he's paying you to tune me up, right? But I could pay you more not to. See what I mean? I could write you a check right now--
Come on, let's go, I got to get back.
Okay cash! Logical. Here's everything I have on me, what do you say? How about a Rolex?
I already got a real one. Come on, it won't be too bad. It's not personal.
Okay, let's get you wired up. I hope this axle grease you got in your hair doesn't screw up the squid receptors.
Superconducting QUantum Interference Device. SQUID. Got it? There's gonna be a test.
Hey, fuck you, man.
Easy, Eduardo, easy. Preserve a sense of humor at all times. Okay, the receptor rig... what I'm putting on your head... sends a signal to the recorder. See we call it "being wired," but there's no wire. You gotta keep the recorder close... five, six feet away max, like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you're going to close escrow, know
Some tips. Don't dart your eyes around. Don't look in the mirror or you'll ID yourself. OK? You got a half hour of tape, so give me some lead-in to the main event. But don't wait too long, I don't want to be going out for popcorn. And don't act natural. Don't act at all. Just forget the thing is on. Got it?
No problem.
We have nothing to talk about, Lenny.
Lenny the loser. Panhandler of stolen dreams.
Leave him alone, Tran.
He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him. Don't talk to anybody. You understand? Not with everything that's going on right now.
You're too goddamned paranoid.
Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to give me some bad news. An old friend of mine has been murdered. You remember Iris?
I made my choice, Lenny.
You said you were going to get her out of this.
Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in. It was touching the way you stood by me in there. "Stand by your man". I was moved. You were very good. I don't think he even understands that you did it for him.
He doesn't know what's going on. Leave him alone.
The only time a whore should open her mouth is when she's giving head.
Fuck you.
Well, I'm certainly in the mood for a party.
Take her up to the suite. Have a glass of champagne... or six... I'll be up in a while to help you ring in the New Year.
This piece of puke hired me to kill you, baby. Do you believe that? Isn't that right, Tran? You pinhead.
Oh my God. I don't believe this is happening.
Believe it. Now bring me the trodes, baby. Come on, quick.
You can't just... kill him.
I'm not. Just a little poach job.
Jesus.
Look, baby, it's now of never... the guy is a known input junkie, so a little OD won't surprise anybody. It's the only way we can be together. You know it's true.
You were supposed to go downstairs, baby.
I know. I don't always do exactly what I'm told. So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?' And you said -- come on Max.
I said, 'Yeah. I'd even do it for free.'
And then she said, 'Since we're going to be spending so much time together--'
Hey, you going to watch or you going to do?
I feel like you're turning me into a VCR.
I don't feel anything. Is it on?
Forget it's there.
Cut it out, Tran.
I don't think that's a good idea, Lenny.
Faith, call me, okay?
Hi, baby. I've missed you.
I know. Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you.
You have to go. I mean it.
Yeah, OK, whatever you say. Just answer one question. Is anything wrong? Iris said you might be in trouble.
You talked to Iris? When?
Tonight.
Well I haven't seen her in months. Who knows what's going on in her head. You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you?
I know you Faith. You're afraid of something. What's going on?
Let it alone, Lenny. It'll take care of itself.
It's Tran, isn't it? This guy is poison, Faith. Listen to me. He's got you walled in on all sides. And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.
That's a good one, coming from you.
Why don't you just split? You don't love him, anybody can see that. And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.
He has his uses too.
What? He gonna record you on his label?
Maybe.
Look, baby, I've watched you create yourself out of nothing. You're like a goddamn cruise missile, targeted on making it. And you will.
Damn right.
You have to get out of here. If Tran catches you he'll... he's acting crazy. He's doing way too much playback and he's getting completely paranoid. He's such a control freak, he's even paying Max to follow me around.
Max Pelcher? You're kidding?
Yeah, for about a month now. Lenny, just stay away from Tran, okay? And stay away from me. Stop trying to rescue me. Those days are over. I'm a big girl now. Stop trying to save me, okay, because I don't need saving... Just... give up on me.
Can't do it.
You're crazier than I thought, Lenny. Coming here... Tran's just in there.
Who did it?
Don't know. But this guy's real damaged goods. Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too. Now no more games, Faith. Whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now. Don't even think about it.
Then what? Then what, Lenny?! You going to protect me? Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny. You don't even have a gun.
I have a gun. It's under my bed.
You don't know what you're fucking with here.
What's going on?
Faith, we know about Jeriko. Iris made me a copy of the tape.
How did it happen? What was Iris doing riding around with Jeriko wearing a wire?
We should talk alone.
So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.
Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
You think Tran killed her?
The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there.
I understand. No, I'm not.
You understand? Attorney! Right? Am I right?
No.
A virgin brain! Well we're going to start you off right. So what do you know about this? Save us some time...
Just what I've read. That the technology was developed for the Feds, to replace the body wire. And now it's gone black market. So, uh, do I get the deck from you?
I'll set you up, get you a deck at my cost... since my thing is the software.
Clips.
That's right. Clips. Look, I want you to know what we're talking about here. This isn't like TV only better. This is life. It's a piece of somebody's life. Pure and uncut, straight from the cerebral cortex. You're there. You're doing it, seeing it, hearing it... feeling it.
What kind of things exactly?
Sounds good.
I can get you what you want. You just have to talk to me. I'm your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the switchboard of souls. I'm the Magic Man, the Santa Claus of the Subconscious. You say it, you even think it, you can have it. You want a girl, you want two girls? I don't know what your thing is or
Talk to me about costs, here.
Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste. I got a deck with me.
What? Right Here?
Yeah, I'm interested, but can we get someplace a little less public?
You see the look on that preppy puke's face? Fuckin' pissed in his Topsiders.
Okay. It was funny. But it cost me money.
Come on, amigo, the world's full of marks. And nobody knows how to work 'em like you do, pal. You could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring! Let me buy you a drink.
Bobbyyyy! Tequila por favor! Double shots. Make it Tres Generaciones, huh. Nothin' but the best for my good friend Lenny, the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad. Hey, nice tie.
Thanks, Max.
D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?
This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.
That's not sayin' much.
You were lucky, Max.
Naw. She won't call me.
Just as well, Lenny. You gotta get past it. I mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, I mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre.
I just hate to see you pining away. It makes me want to vomit, frankly. Broken hearts are for assholes.
See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense.
Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
I'm telling ya, it's over. We used it all up--
Shoulda told me about your new gig, buddy.
I was gonna tell ya. Hey, it's just a job. I feel like shit about it.
You should feel like shit.
I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time. Do us both good. Right?
Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you. Hey, at least you got a job! Watch her for me. Stay on her.
You alright? Y'okay?
Yeah. No, not really.
Let's work it.
Not now... I don't want to think about it--
Come on, Lenny. You used to be good at this stuff. Play it down. What's the perp doing?
He stalks her. He rapes her. Then he does her...
And he records it. Thrill kill. Wants to see it again. And again.
He records himself raping and killing her--
But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--
So she feels... what he feels... while he's in her. The thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him. I've seen a lot, Max.
So've I. Too much.
But this is a bad one.
Top ten.
That's right. He wants to share. Needs an audience. This is one sick puppy.
Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed.
Faith OK?
Yeah. She's leaving with Tran so I got to boogie. Real quick... Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a false name. Paid cash.
Looks like she was holding out.
Yup. Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night. Another slick Lenny move.
He's in this somehow... I don't know how. Just stay close to Faith.
Sounds like Tick's already celebrating.
He's been cooked-off
Is he dead?
Whattya mean?
All I'm saying... you don't know how high up the food chain this thing goes. I've heard stuff.
What stuff?
Jesus.
Yeah. So don't walk near me in public, alright.
Mace... no disrespect... but you run this on the 11 o'clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history. They'll see the fucking smoke from Canada.
Okay... what about Strickland?
He's got her up in the room, under guard. And he's still working the party... acting smooth like nothin's nothin'. So buddy... I say we work a trade.
What do you mean?
Give him the tape. See? It's fucking brilliant! The tape for Faith. I know he'll go for it. I can set it up.
This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
2-2-0-3. Got it. Stay on her.
No. I suppose not. I didn't know you were colorblind, Max.
I'll have that. Glock 22. Nice.
Where's Faith?
I sent her to the party. I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
You just did.
Jesus!
So... I killed Tran. Then you ran in, being on his payroll, and shot me.
Wait a minute. Now I'm remembering. I killed Iris too, didn't I?
That's right. They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment. The one I left for you at the club was a copy.
Was I a really busy guy? Did I do Tick too?
Picture it... I feel like I gotta share this with somebody. It's too perfect.
I won't say anything.
Only he doesn't know about me and Faith. So I say to myself, if I turn the job down, he just gets somebody else. And I lose Faith... to coin a phrase. So to buy time, I do the skank. I still gotta do something about Tran... I figure it's him or me... but I can't cap him without a chump to take the
And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.
No plan is perfect, Lenny. Hey, cheer up. World's gonna end in ten minutes anyway.
You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump.
So there never was a death squad.
Naawww.
Just those two loose-cannon cops running around covering their butts.
How did you hook up with Faith?
Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny.
Well you could've at least warned me. You know I hate the zap... when they die. It just brings down your whole day. Jeez, Tick.
How'd you get the tape? Why didn't the cops put it in evidence?
With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig. Guy had it under a wig.
Yeah, but how'd it get to you?
I got ways, Lenny, I got ways. Okay, okay... I got a deal with some a the paramedics. My guy pages me and I pick it up at the morgue. So whaddya think? This clip's gotta be worth at least a grand. Right?
Tick. Not to dash your hopes, but I don't deal this kind of product, you know that. I'll give you four for it, cause I've gotta cut off the last bit. And my customers want uncut.
Fuck that! The last part's the best. You dry-dive six stories and blammo! Jack right into the Big Black.
I don't deal black-jack clips! It's policy. I got ethics here.
Yeah, when did that start? Come on, man! It's what people want to see, and you know it.
So lay it off to somebody else.
Give me six at least. This's a good clip, here. Gets you pumpin'.
Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
Sure, like this low-grade shit here, some girl in a fight with her boyfriend... it's a test-pattern. Nothing happens. I'm snorin'.
Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me real life. Bring me street life. And, like, one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's Technicolor.'
I said that? Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.
Ha! That's for fucking sure.
Whoa. That is one unbelievable piece of eyefuck.
Skip the art criticism, Tick, what can you tell me about the wearer.
Lookit, you see the peak period ratios there? Could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion or something. Some kind of trauma This is not good. I don't like this at all...
What?
Well, it's cutting awful close to me. I mean she was just here.
Who was just here?
Iris, man. Pay attention.
Wait, wait... wait a minute. Iris was here?!
Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip.
What clip? What was it?
I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it. Said I wouldn't want to see it. She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'
You come to peddle me some tapes, Lenny? For old time's sake? Make a couple bucks for the holidays?
You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.
Show a little respect, Nero. The man was an important artist.
Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning. Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out.
I always do.
About what?
Charm.
It's alright. He means it.
Nero.
Strickland.
Commissioner Strickland.
Sure. Whatever. See, since you shitcanned my career, I don't even have to call you sir. One of life's small pleasures.
Aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter?
I don't like disappointments, Nero. And do you know what disappoints me very much?
Your sex life?
Greetings, gents. So let's hear this week's sad story.
Thanks for giving me a ride. I just have a few stops, mostly on the west side--
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds. I've already pulled twelve hours today.
Come on, Mace. This is gonna be a big night. Can't you feel it? The energy in the air? There's money to be made, dreams to sell.
Sleaze to peddle.
Just a couple of hours. It'll be fun--
Excuse me. What part of NO don't you understand?
Mace, you're my friend. I need you. Plus I'll give you 25% of what I make tonight.
Jeez, you're pathetic. Okay, I got a pickup at the St. James. I'll take you there, you can get a cab.
Mace! You're a life-saver.
So, what's up with you? Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?
No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.
Way I look at it, I actually perform a humanitarian service. I save lives.
Uh huh, I wanna hear this part.
Okay, take some executive... bored with his life, bored with his wife... he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar. Then he goes around for months, torn up worrying that he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his wife. And maybe he really does catch something--
Price he pays for being a scumsucking pig.
Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are. But now the risks are outa line. The streets are a war zone. And sex can kill you. So you slip on the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks.
Lenny, this shit's illegal.
Define illegal.
Me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail twice in the last six months.
Yeah, but that was for love.
What's his name?
Fumitsu.
What the fuck are you doing?
Coming with you.
Are we having a bad night?
Hey, careful on the jacket. This is Armani. You angry?
I've had enough of this shit. You're on foot, Lenny.
I need my case. It's still in the back.
That would be no.
I've had it. No more wirehead shit in my car. You understand? You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
I thought we were friends.
No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another. You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act. Well I'm out. I got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex- husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support... I'm just trying to hold on here.
So am I. Just trying to get by.
No, you're just trying to get off.
Macey... I've never seen you like this.
Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life. You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next. And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it. Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer.
I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace. Really.
Look, I gotta get some sleep.
Yeah. I don't see a way out of it.
Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way.
Jesus, Lenny.
Begging? Groveling? Any pathetic behavior at all? Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her.
Who's the new side of beef in Tran's posse?
Guy named Wade Beemer. Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and '97.
Forget her.
She still loves me.
She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit. Trust me on this.
She's my destiny.
Destiny? You living in a perfume commercial? She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride.
You're some piece of work, you know that. Just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never let it touch you. I mean, between Vice and this so- called occupation you're in now, you must've seen it all.
I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
What I'm saying. But you still come out this goofball romantic.
What's that? Present from Faith?
What is it?
My God, Lenny. What is it?
Black. Jack.
Blackjack? I don't understand--
Snuff clip. It was Iris. She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her.
And gives it to you.
Cause you're the man, right? The Magic Man. If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.
Jesus, Mace. Back off.
Uh unh. No way! They'd crucify me.
Is this great fabric or what?
You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?
He knows what he's doing. He's worn before... a lot.
So that gives you something.
Don't crank the gain any more. You're gonna fry yourself.
No more, Lenny.
She came to me for help. I should have read it better... I just figured, y'know... another strung- out hooker having a bad night.
See, it's all about what they see walking in. A dead hooker, handcuffs, penetration... they'll see a trick gone wrong. Random kill. The kind you never solve.
But that doesn't add, does it.
No it doesn't.
She said "If they get me". They. Which means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover, which means somebody whacked her for a reason.
So the guy's not a sicko.
If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up. But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
Because it had to look random. Not connected to anything or anyone. But then why give the rape to me?
That's where it gets a little strange.
And what about the guy that was following me?
The question is not whether I am paranoid, but whether I am paranoid enough. You want to rub my neck?
How's Zander?
I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier. I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway. I'm sorry.
Whatup Lenny?
Where we going?
What is it?
Will you relax. There's nobody back there.
Mace, the guy had a knife. To my throat. In my living room. Relaxing might be right out, okay?!
You better keep a low profile for a while.
Lenny, have you lost it completely?
Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said.
She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
Lenny, give them the tape.
Shit!
Take it easy. The glass is bullet resistant.
Bullet resistant? Whatever happened to bullet proof?
Goddamnit!! 911 is busy!
This is bad.
Are you out of your fucking mind?!
I can't believe we had to give them the damn tape.
Those two guys were cops.
You sure?
Tell me.
I can't tell you. You've got to see.
Uh unh. I won't do it.
Hang on. Hang on, Max. You see?
I see. I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all.
We got to make another copy of this. Little life insurance.
You know what this tape could do if it gets out.
I've got a good idea, yeah.
People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One. Jesus. Maybe they ought to see.
So, let's see, I've got Tran's goons, some squidhead psycho and the LAPD all trying to kill me. Happy new year, Lenny.
Well, look at the plus side.
There's a plus side?
Yeah. You gave up your hot tub tape to save me. That's real progress for you.
It was a tough call.
I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.
I don't think those cops did Iris. I think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her.
Why?
He's totally cut off from the outer world.
The only card we have to play is the tape. You know, we get it to the media somehow...
Who's Strickland?
Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch.
Okay, we gotta get over there. Can you borrow a dress from Cecile or something--
I'm not going.
Whatya mean? We're going! Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
Yeah. Lenny. I have.
It didn't stop you from loving them. Right? Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...
I guess.
And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them. Did it?
I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity. I was lost, Mace. In outer darkness. Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank. Another lost soul.
You never told me.
But she was different. There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice. It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice. I helped her. And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect
Mace... you're a girl.
Got your ticket?
You see Tran?
Alright. We're going up.
And do what? Take on his whole posse?
That's the original. There are no copies.
Take it to him.
A cop? You want me to trust a cop?!
Oh boy. What if you're wrong?
Then we'll be right where we are now.
Are we under arrest?
Hey, Lenny. We made it.
Well... Get going. You're still bleeding.
See you downtown.
Where were you Mom? Did you meet a guy?
Just Lenny.
Right. That explains it.
What is that?
Cheerios and wieners. I made it myself. It's good.
We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey. We're going to watch fireworks from there. Let's go. Chop chop.
No. I haven't noticed because I make my payments. So, Max Pelcher, how's the P.I. business?
Hey, isn't that Tran Vo?
Yup. He was Jeriko's manager. Bummer, Tran! Lost your golden goose. Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
But I mean isn't he Faith's new--
He's skull-fucking you, bud. Trying to get a reaction. Maybe pushing you to do something.
Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.
Those two psycho cops are on a slash-and-burn to find the tape and cover their tracks.
This seems a little sophisticated for them. These are not subtle guys.
So you're saying we just pretend is didn't happen? It happened! The LAPD executed one of the most important black men in America! Who the fuck are you to bury this?!
Fine. Do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains? The gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground. And when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves. It'll be all- out war and you know it.
Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!
Was this him?
Um... he was older.
Besides that.
To be honest, when I'm working, I don't look at faces much. He knew the guy's name.
Testa?
Have you had a chance to think about --
Zorro. Yes, ran it through my files, even asked around: came up completely blank. Thought there might be a Mexico connection, El Paso and all, but nothing. Fooled around with the letter "Z," turned it on it's side, got "N" -- there Ng, he's Vietnamese. The only thing that came to mind was zero, not Zorro. Remember Suspect Zero?
No.
...well, there was some friction: I wanted to write up my work, educate the public, but Koessler wouldn't allow it. Low felt Koessler was more interested in career advancement than catching killers. Koessler had Low reassigned to the Pacific Northwest, Seattle. You know when they say, stick it where the sun don't shine? That's where they stuck Dick Low.
Pacific Northwest is a hotbed for serials.
Does Koessler know about the Suspect Zero theory?
Welcome back, sir. How was the vacation?
Takes four days to chill, then its time to come back. Is that...?
Agent Duncan, there's an interstate issue up on 54, run out there.
Agents Duncan, Mackelway. Anything new?
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
Anybody talk to the press?
No, sir.
You run the plates?
Fella's name is Harold Speck, travelin' man out of Roswell.
Excuse me, a salesman gets done in his car and you call the FBI?
Where's the Nuevo American Diner?
I hope that wasn't a joke because I can assure you, from personal experience, the FBI does not have a sense of humor.
Nine bodies in Roswell, now this -- it's getting a little hairy, huh?
I'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself.
Her name is Karen Sumpter, from near Dell City. Just disappeared a couple weeks back. Vanished.
You're thinking...?
Who knows.
This isn't in our database?
Agent Mackelway.
Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan.
Oh Jesus, Sheriff, I am sorry. I meant to call you -- I got distracted -- the Sumpter girl was not one of Speck's victims. That's the good news.
What's the bad news?
You tell me.
No bad news. You know the Be On the LookOut you asked me to send on the diner car -- we got a hit on it. A little town on the border, Socorro. We got it staked out -- you interested?
Hey, Sheriff.
Down the road a piece is the Golden Sunset, the no-tell motel, Socorro's contribution to international relations. The car's just sitting there, no activity. I've had a couple Hispanic officers casing it all day. Want to take a look?
What does the Manager say?
I sent a female in. The room in question was rented by an Anglo, cash; since then, nothing -- no activity, no phone response.
The room key's in the car. On the seat.
Show's over, boys. Nobody home.
Tape it off, we'll want to fine-tooth- comb it. My guess is that the UNSUB is having us on. He checks in, pays, picks up the key, but never walks inside. Tell me if I'm wrong.
Dylan here.
Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
Hi there.
I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case.
You heard?
What?
You have the body?
She's buried.
I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?
The family has gone through a lot. Their daughter missing, the search, her body found, the funeral -- then this order to exhume the corpse.
I'm sorry. This won't take long.
The body was embalmed. I don't understand --
Turn the body over. There was something in the autopsy report, yes, here. These burn marks.
A grill pattern.
Ligature strangulation, just like his victims. A cord, nylon, you can tell by the indentation signature -- again, like his victims. Look at that little thing and look at all the trouble it got him in. Should have cut it off.
I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.
We had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this.
Be my guest, Agent Kulok, scrub suits are in the back.
Ripped off. By hand, my guess. Perimortal: victim was alive at the time, there's blood on his throat.
There seems to be a discrepancy.
Not a discrepancy, an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons, not 6.
I have 6 tons.
Mam, it's my truck. I know my own capacity.
You can't imagine how many men have told me that.
It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
Oh yes, I see. You must get asked this a lot.
Jesus.
You... surprised me.
Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always lugging that case around. Whatja sell?
Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name.
You must travel a lot, huh?
Yeah.
Whole country or just hereabouts?
I don't mean to be rude, but...
Just gettin' a jolt of java before headin' on home? How does your wife feel about it?
What?
About your being away all the time. Must get lonely.
Look...
You must get lonely. You ever think about, you know...
Excuse me?
What are you...?
Look, mister...
My God.
Not bad, huh?
You're a... you're sick.
Calm down, Harold. Okay, here's what we're going to do, Harold: there's a pull off up ahead, we're going to stop there.
Oh God, mister, please leave me alone.
You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
I've been looking for you.
The man who was with him, he was a construction worker?
Yes.
What did he look like?
I didn't wait on him. Fifty or so, white, regular build, needed a shave -- that's all I remember.
How did you know he was a construction worker?
He was sitting here?
There was a car in the lot when we closed. Gone today.
What kind?
An old junker. Like a reservation car. Blue, side door with brown, you know, primer paint. New Mexico plates. A Ford or ah, yeah, a Ford.
Speck's the killer all right. We got box loads of evidence. Did 'em all the same way: torture, strangulation. Prostitutes. I don't think we'll be able to write off any outstandings on him -- this is probably the full body count.
What about his killer?
Nada. Vague description, that's all. Fine-tooth-combed Speck's car, the diner: no fingerprints, no trace evidence.
You have the photo from the diner?
At the field office.
He said it was a clue?
Maybe something to do with Zorro.
Don't say that. Don't even think that. The next thing we'll be hearing about "Zorro Killer" in the media -- this hasn't gotten out, has it?
Just hospital talk. Nothing that connects to Speck.
Chuck, hello. This is Agent Kulok. She has a background in medical forensics.
We didn't know Speck was a serial, the police didn't know, his wife didn't know -- so how did the killer know?
Maybe cause he's smart.
Sorry to interrupt you, sir, but I thought you'd like to know.
What?
We have another one.
Another what?
Deputy Director, get out, sir.
What are you doing?
Mackelway, I could understand. He is over-emotional by nature, but you, Agent Kulok, you had a shining career in front of you.
Look, sorry. Don't say a word. I know this is improper. I've been trying to speak with Deputy Director Koessler. I left a message. I must speak with you before you go back to Washington.
I think I talked to him.
Who?
Speck. Harold Speck.
From the grave?
I'll relay this to CIIAC.
They don't know how to crack these secret chat rooms --
I might point out, Agent Mackelway, the reason we haven't been able to crack those rooms is that you refused to share that information with us -- which is also why you were reassigned.
I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is not based on personal preference. We share information.
Let some by-the-book J. Edgar Agents go into the chat room, spook these guys with stupid questions, blow my cover? -- no way.
You refused to comply with a direct order.
I was lucky to find, much less crack, the address code -- no way to be sure I could have done it again.
Its called insubordination.
How do you feel, Agent
Pretty embarrassed, to be honest. I had him.
Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.
He got away. I had him. He got away.
Do you think he singled you out?
The cut on your arm -- mind if we remove the bandage?
Agent Mackelway, you're going to get your wish. You're going back to Washington. I want you back in Computer Crimes. Fire up those chat rooms.
This time, sir, if I may be so bold, would it be possible to set up my equipment outside CIIAC, perhaps in military housing at Quantico? I didn't get along very well with the other members of the Division. We thought differently.
You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing?
I'll take it into consideration.
What I do requires confidentiality.
I always meant to ask, what is it that makes you so special? Why is it you have this special rapport with multiple killers? Why you?
You feeling okay, Agent Mackelway?
Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.
Nothing concrete. Nothing I'd... well, nothing.
I don't believe this.
I'm hesitant to...
"Murman" was the alter identity of William Heirens, the original "Catch Me Before I Kill Again" killer. Short for "Murder Man." It was the case that got Richard Low and I started in this field.
I spoke with Lloyd Daitz.
That gasbag. I can imagine what he said. I'm not ashamed to admit that most of what I know about criminal profiling started with Richard Low. I have also, over the years, I admit, taken credit for many of his accomplishments. He was the most brilliant law enforcement individual I ever met.
"Was?"
We had every reason to believe he was on that plane. He was supposed to be on the plane. Everything was incinerated, it was two weeks before we reached the crash site. We, the Director and I, decided it was in everyone's best interest to declare Dick Low dead. That way he could exit a hero.
You suspected all along, suspected he was alive. That's why you came to El Paso.
Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file.
How long ago?
Both in the last year. I suspected only someone as brilliant as Dick Low could find these guys. Look, whatever Daitz told you, nobody wanted to strip Richard of his badge. You have to get close to be good at what he did, the trick is not to get too close.
You knew the arm slash was not "Zorro."
I suspected, but you were the one Low contacted. That's why I brought you back here.
What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory?
I got a look in Testa's computer. His screen name was "Imelda." Have to give him that, had a sense of humor.
We're waiting for trace evidence results on the Rice killing.
We need to put out an NCIC inquiry.
How do you send out an APB on a dead man?
Huh?, sir.
Why did you go to Chicago?
I was visiting an old college friend.
You didn't tell anyone where you were?
An oversight, sir, I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket.
I'm told you've asked for a Bureau cross-check of flight records to and from El Paso, Ft. Myers, Omaha, the Murman murder time frames.
I was looking for a pattern.
That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.
I didn't use Low's name.
There was talk of a file photo.
Watch out for Dick Low, he's a liar; he has his own world. There was a Junior Agent in Seattle, not unlike you, an Agent who fell under Dick's spell. He'd have done anything for Agent Low. Richard got this Agent to take a suspect to the crime scene, beat him up, force a confession -- all unauthorized, all illegal. The Agent died that
I understand.
He's got you believing in Zero now too.
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
We'll wait. Get online with Low, inform him of Zero's route -- we'll set a trap for him.
What about Zero, Darryl Hawkins?
Hawkins isn't the target, Richard Low's the target.
There's a killer out there -- we know who he is. He could be stalking now.
Dick Low's a killer too.
Miss me, Dave?
Don't you touch him.
You better hope the Director doesn't stop abruptly one day, David, you might break your nose.
You're a disgrace to law enforcement, to the Bureau -- and to me.
You are so fucked up.
When I was at the rest stop, there was a young boy, maybe ten, and his mother. Darryl Hawkins, Zero, abducted the boy in the men's room. I tried to stop him. He cold-cocked me --
Agent Kulok, that boy, as we speak, is in Hawkins' truck, probably still alive, in a dark refrigerated compartment, shivering in just a T- shirt: put yourself in his mind, freezing, terrified, wanting his mother. Put yourself in his mother's place, desperate, imagining the worst is happening as she pleads, back there at the rest stop, for someone, anyone, to listen to her. This
Shut the fuck up or I'll shut you up.
Thanks for the ride.
They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.
None taken.
Maybe I shouldn't put it that way. I'm on my best behavior. I've got to watch what I say.
You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?
The Academy, then CIIAC.
I read your white paper. It's sort of like the Bible for what they're trying to do in Computer Crime.
How long have you been downtown?
You work with Koessler?
Not especially.
Why did he come out here? What's going on?
This is a sexy case.
Yeah, you know the vic's car, he was killed this side of the state line, the car then pushed across the border. This by an Unknown Subject, presumably the killer, who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot, which may or may not have been accidental.
Doesn't fit.
This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have? We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the FBI to know he exists.
And who kills in the manner of his victim.
That information's being withheld from the media.
Some kids found you in a garbage dump.
Yes I do.
Relax. J. Edgar's greatest fear: a female with a badge.
The man knew how to dress.
Don't even go there. What's up?
Setting up. Technically, anyone in a chat room can be traced back to a screen address. But, by using punters, a correspondent literally punts his address around the world, through computers in countries that have no communication treaties. The correspondent becomes "ghosted," invisible.
What about the chat rooms themselves?
That's the beauty of the system. This is a fugitive chat room. It moves from place to place, chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours: a gardening website, Chaucer buffs, a dating service. A pre- arranged code shows up in one of fifty porn rooms -- that's where I stumbled across it -- notifying "friends" to meet at a certain time, usually
That's part of the reason I dropped by. I need to learn this stuff.
The other reason?
Working the net isn't that different from ordinary undercover work. You go into the community, walk their walk, talk their talk, gain their confidence.
They're all criminals?
No, no, no, most of them -- I used to think all of them -- are just fantasists, guys who get off telling degrading stories. When I came across this fugitive chat room, listened in, I started to think some might actually be real, that they'd gone live. The challenge was to figure out which was which. Then I had my disagreement with Koessler.
"Gone live?"
Chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims: "I went live last month."
This is some serious shit.
Taking a Stryker saw, cutting off the top of someone's cranium, pulling the brain out -- what's that, a day in Spring?
You got a point there.
People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.
I was going to be a physician, I am a physician, but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.
I was interested in two things: computers and crime. They sort of came together.
And one other thing.
What's that?
Look at this fellow... or this one.
Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good?
He thinks he looks young.
What's this country coming to?
Take it to the next level. What are his fantasies, what turns him on, what kind of pornography does he like? If he could act out his fantasies, what would he do? Imagine yourself one of his victims, realizing your life is in his hands. What is he thinking?
Every cop has a story and every story has a girl. The girl in my story was fifteen years-old. She wore a pink angora sweater -- I can still see it -- one day, she disappeared. I told the police she wouldn't run away, I told them who to look for, but I was just a kid. I sat in the police station crying
Me too. Make any headway with "Zorro"?
None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.
I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?
I ever get like that, just take me out in back and shoot me.
Don't be too harsh.
I saw him on a talk show once, talking about these killers like they were his friends. Not the victims, not the families of the victims, he doesn't talk about them. Blood money, that's what it is. Did he hit on you?
Huh?
When you were his student? Did he come on to you?
Of course he did. He came on to every attractive student. Which bothers you most: that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me?
You must really think I'm a square, a computer nerd.
Why did Koessler assign you as my liaison?
Because you asked him to, stupid.
There are Agency regulations about this.
"Intra-Agency fraternizing."
It's a no-no.
I know.
I've been thinking about this.
Does Koessler ask about me?
He's called a couple times.
What did you tell him?
Just routine stuff.
Not about coming to see Daitz?
Find the feet?
No. Cut off while he was still alive, look at his wrists, damn near ripped his hands off trying to get free. Must have been screaming real loud when the killer chain-sawed his throat. Unfortunately, he'd soundproofed his van.
We got an UNSUB walking around with four feet?
Jesus.
The tattoo?
Sue Ann Hanson.
You mean --
Did they disconnect Testa's computer?
You should have seen the store manager at Parade of Shoes. She was inconsolable.
Mack, I'm sorry. I apologize. I should have called. I had no right to sneak in on you like that.
No, Jaime, I apologize. I didn't... I had no right to speak to you like that.
I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.
Maybe we should back off a bit.
I can't. They trust me, they accept me. I've got their confidence.
No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me.
There's the Agency issue. I think Koessler may suspect something already. We're not on the best footing with him as it is.
That's true.
Then there's the other issue.
What's that?
You need time to think. About the case, about you and me.
I found a peephole into Deviant World. I'm gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out.
And nobody else can do that?
Not the way I can.
That's my point. Remember, you're a cop pretending to be a deviant. It's not the other way around.
Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
Hello?
Jaime? Where are you?
Where are you? Everybody's looking for you.
What's up?
My watch. He toyed with me. He sent me to Chicago.
You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you.
Start killing people for real?
Suspect Zero.
That's a crackpot theory. Everybody says so.
This feels like something out of a spy novel.
I guess I'm a little paranoid.
I met with Richard Low. These are names of missing persons he has flagged. I'm double-checking every case, but I don't want to be too obvious about it. I marked the ones I'd like you to work on.
Slow down a second, you met with Low --
You were right. He found me.
And you're working with him?
I need something tangible. To hook him. I told him I'd found the confidential file on the Suspect Zero theory.
Does one exist?
Probably. I told him Koessler had ordered the report, kept it secret.
Koessler doesn't know any of this?
I'd be real careful if I were you.
It's too late for that. I've gone ahead of the curve on this one. There's no turning back. When this is over, Koessler is going to be right or Low is going to be right or I'm going to be right, but not all of us.
It's okay to be wrong, just don't be dead wrong.
They say Richard Low is wrong, but because of him, women, innocent women, are alive who would be dead.
You're putting me in a difficult position.
Jaime, do you think, when this is all over, when we're in different divisions, you think maybe you and me, we could try again?
But why this pattern?
Tom, you okay?
Hardly anyone calls me Tom. Everybody calls me Mack. I always liked that.
You okay?
Yeah, of course.
It's quite advanced.
Burn marks. The original M.E. listed it as "burn residue." Same place, the outer thigh, as Karen Sumpter. The UNSUB is able to abduct, kill, transport and bury without detection.
All the same killer?
Low calls him Suspect Zero.
Suspect Zero is a crackpot theory. You said so.
That's what Koessler wants us to believe. To discredit Low.
You're assigned, we're assigned, to apprehend Richard Low, not Suspect Zero. I have to tell you, Mack, I'm not comfortable where you're going.
I haven't changed anything. Damn.
I...
Jaime --
It's a truck. A refrigerated truck.
Zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country.
How are we going to find him?
What happened?
Agent...
Kulok.
Unlock these cuffs.
Mack must think Zero has a police band.
Uncuff me. What's wrong with you? Don't you want to save the boy?
Okay, I'll unhook you. No weapon.
No weapon.
Bitch! Cunt! Please, please, please don't do this, Agent Kulok. You need me.
How did you know Speck was a killer?
Who are you?
Agent Mackelway?
Yes.
This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive.
Yes, sir.
Dave Koessler must have you jumping through hoops.
I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.
How's the arm?
I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz.
He couldn't break an egg with a hammer. He still writing those crime porn books?
He's moved on to TV.
What was your weakness, sir?
I'm not sure, exactly. I had monsters on the brain. I wanted to get these guys, every one of them. I got obsessive.
Suspect Zero?
Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident?
So you went underground?
Was I afraid of Dave Koessler? Not likely. I told you, I'd gotten a bit obsessive. It was an opportunity to back off, think things through. Where's the file?
I don't carry it with me.
You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
Hum a tune and I'll sing to it.
It's my master list of missing persons: men, boys, girls, children over the last ten years. Two hundred and eighty-five names. A pool of possible victims.
Zero killed them all?
Of course not. They're possibles. I've checked them against Bureau records, check them against your file. How did you get it?
After my hiatus, after I got my priorities readjusted, I drifted online, started tracking porn chat rooms, looking for Zero. Got accepted, came across these boys swapping stories, pictures, downloads. Never found Zero, but I did come across some Class A scumbags.
How do you know who's real and who's not?
And who else did I find? Agent Thomas Mackelway, crackerjack FBI techie. I was greatly disappointed when you were re-assigned.
You knew it was me all along?
There's someone out there, Mack, I know, some man killing for the fun of it, sniffing human glue, without regard to age or sex, without predicable M.O. Someone who has a way to dispose of the bodies. You have access, you can call up local authorities, check morgues, conduct interviews. Be my man.
I already have an employer.
If you won't do it for me, do it for your cousin, Nadine, right? The girl in the pink sweater.
Who told you about her?
You did. You were with her when she disappeared, right? She took you to the mall or the movies, you turn around and she's gone.
It was the mall.
I know you, Lionheart. I watched your mind work, heard your dirty thoughts --
We're alike. We are hunters. We have the gift. It's ancient times all over again. We stand between order and chaos. I need help. I can't carry on alone.
Maybe you should back off.
This guy, Zero, he drifts around, that's how they all start, drifting around, their minds filling up with fantasies. He thinks he's real smart, laughs at us, laughs at his victims. But he has left a trail, and the trail is somewhere in those names. You know how to reach me. Take my advice, when dealing with these FBI tight-asses, go by the book.
You? You went by the book?
Is he dead?
Yeah.
Was it Zero?
[Fantasy time, girls, give it up, give it up.]
[Reality very risky.]
[Lionheart, what happened?]
[You want to talk, Lionheart, or you want to take this a little more personal?]
Lead the way, Murman.
I've been to Chicago.
[Not this way. Call it a little favor, call it a little thing I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you. You'll owe me one.]
If I owe, I will go.
[The address is 147 South Rane. It's a lively address. You got a problem with dark meat?]
Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try.
[If you wanted a good steak, you should have gone to Omaha.]
Let's talk about Zero.
[Hello, Agent Mackelway. How's the watch? Maybe you can do one of those TV commercials, I found my watch under a serial killer's heart and it was still ticking.]
I want to help you.
I've located the Suspect Zero file. Did you know there was one? Koessler ordered it as part of your evaluation.
[Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.]
Not everything is imputed to memory. The most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy. Why would the Zero file be kept secret?
[You tell me.]
George Sheldon? The second serial killer killed in the manner of his killings. The crime scene profile was never entered into VICAP. At whose request? David Koessler.
[What does the file say?]
I want to go live with you.
[And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
Leave this room, I'll go back with you, blow your cover.
Good morning, sir. Agent Salinas, sir.
So you're the new meat?
Yes, sir.
What did you do to end up here?
I believe it's in my file, sir.
Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?
Thomas Mackelway.
Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?
Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir.
"Computer Investigation and Infrastructure Assessment Center." Quantico out of MIT -- you're a techie? Okay, you screwed up once. So did half the guys here. That's why they're here.
I screwed up twice, sir.
I see that. Washington to Philadelphia to here. Philly's a nice station. How many agents?
Four hundred and sixty, sir.
"Attitude Adjustment Issues" -- what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request.
This is a first. You criticized the Deputy Director to his face and you still have a badge? You must have some one-of-a-kind skills. Why don't you just quit? I mean, you're not going to get promoted, not wearing this jacket.
I like working for the Bureau, sir. I like catching bad guys. It's all I care about.
Agent Mackelway, you want to get off your ass and do something for a change?
Yes, sir.
Headed there now. The same shift will be on at noon.
This case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to Washington. Your old boss is coming out.
Koessler?
No.
"MyDick?"
MyDick. As in my dick. That was his screen name.
I don't...
Eight, nine months ago. When I was at Computer Crime. I got into a chat room with someone named MyDick. I'd talked to him before. Everything I saw yesterday, everything in the autopsies, it's identical. The forensics are dead on. MyDick's fantasies involved a hog-tie rig, nylon cord, torture with pliers, rip the nipples -- when the "item" screams, she chokes. He had a
Speck is dead.
But why attack an Agent?
How far is Amarillo?
350 miles.
Locate a jet, we're going to Amarillo.
Excuse me, Agent Mackelway?
I don't think you understand.
What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
I'm Agent Thomas Mackelway, FBI. There is no way you will escape. Assistant Deputy Director Richard Low is en route with another Agent. You may know Low by another name. You may know him by the name Murman. I am Lionheart.
Murman!
He's a brilliant man. Brilliant enough to catch you.
You want to "profile" me? Find out what makes me "tick"? Write about me, go on a talk show, give me a nickname?
It's over for you.
Michael, this is Grandma. I want to know if you got the part on that television program. I told the whole family and they're very excited to know if... Skipping message. End of final message.
Shit.
You have to put things in perspective.
I know, I know.
You've been through worse.
You're right. I know.
Ever since I've known you.
I don't know about that.
Moving here from New York was much more of an adjustment than this.
It didn't feel that way.
That's because it was a challenge. You has control over you're situation. It was hard, but you rose to it.
Okay. I'll think about that. Bye.
You really should. Life, after all, is really just a series of challenges...
Enough. I've got to use the phone.
Are you calling Her?
You should call your Grandmother.
Don't do it, Mike.
Do you realize that I've been waiting for that call for six months and I cut her off?
How are you ladies doing this evening?
What do you drive?
I'm sorry?
What kind of car do you drive?
You like laughing at the misery of others?
Thanks.
I've seen you somewhere... Where have I seen you?
You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico?
...maybe...
...Monday nights? I host an open mike...
You're a comedian?
Yeah.
What's that like?
Well, you know, it's tough. A lot of traveling. A lot of hotels... but, you know, it's a dream... and the money's really good. I think I might buy another really expensive imported car after my next gig in Vegas...
I know! Starbucks! I served you an espresso at Starbucks.
Are you sure? Maybe...
Yes! Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager?
Oh, yeah... Boy, that must've been a while ago.
I'd say about two weeks.
Probably a little longer than that, but, whatever.
Well, thank you...?
Nikki.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm Mike.
Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
Like the quiche?
Yes. Like the quiche.
I like quiche.
I thought real men don't like quiche.
My reputation seems to have preceded me.
Why? You're not a real man?
...so I thought, what the hell, they make movies in L.A., not in Michigan, so I moved here.
Just like that?
Well, it wasn't the simple, but yeah.
How was it hard?
Well, I left someone very special behind.
Tell me about it...
You too?
Yeah.
I thought I was going to die.
It's been six months and I'm just starting to get over it.
Oh, God. That's two more than me. Tell me it gets better.
It does.
How?
Well, it still sucks, but you start to see that there are advantages to being single.
Like what?
What else?
What else...? Let's see... You have complete freedom.
To do what?
I don't know... To grow, to go out. Whatever you want.
Anything?
Anything.
Like if I meet a handsome young man and I wanted to ask him to dance? I can do that?
Uh, if the guy wants to.
You don't think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with?
Yes. I mean, no. I mean, maybe he would find her, I mean you attractive. Maybe he doesn't like to dance. Maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who don't dance either...
Maybe it doesn't matter if he's a good dancer cause it's a slow song, if that's what he's afraid of.
No... Maybe that's not the case. Maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to...
Charles! What's up, man?
Oh. You know.
Did you, um, did you get that pilot?
No, man. I know you didn't get it 'cause you wouldn't've asked me. It wasn't that funny anyway...
...and boy does it hurt when they ask.
I don't even tell them about anything I'm close on anymore...
...not until you book it...
...and even then...
You want to come with us to a party at the Chateau Marmont? They got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies.
They're out of Glenlivet.
Why don't I just wait three weeks and tell her I was cleaning out my wallet and found her number...
...then ask where you met her...
Hi.
Oh, I'm sorry. How'd your folks take it?
I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
You haven't told then, huh?
No.
I'm considering taking a job as a "Goofy".
...I heard it took four days to light for that shot...
I know what you're saying, man. I don't know what to tell you...
Hi, boys, we almost gave up on you.
Oh, are we late? There are no clocks in this town.
No... no... The worst was when I went in for this After-School special and I'm sitting in the waiting room with all these little kids. I see they're all signed in for the same role as me...
They were auditioning for the same role as you?
It's like, you looked at my tape. You saw my picture. Why did you call me in? You knew I was twenty-four.
Let me just check on my boy.
Always...
Lisa works at the MGM Grand...
Oh my God.
The poor thing. Six years?
...And she's with someone else.
He's so sweet. He really said that?
I believe it too. He really just wants her to be happy.
A couple of high rollers like you?
Could you believe it?
Wait here, I'll get you that martini.
Nah, I didn't really want it anyway. I just wanted to order it.
Can I get you something else? I mean, you shouldn't leave without getting something for free.
What do you guys do?
On the table.
Sorry?
You have to lay it on the table.
You're not allowed to hand me money, sir. You'll have to lay it on the table if you want me to change it.
Huh?
You want this in black chips.
Do you have anything smaller?
Do you ever perform out here? I'd love to see you.
No...
You should. A lot of comics play Vegas.
Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy...
Why not?
There are different circuits... it's hard to explain... you wouldn't understand...
Who's your booking agent?
Oh? You know about booking agents... I don't, uh, actually have a west coast agent as of yet...
Well, who represents you back east?
Actually, it's funny you... I'm actually, uh, between...
I'm sure she'll call. Six years is a long time. You don't just break it off cleanly after six years.
I know, but she did. She's with someone else now...
Already? You poor thing. It won't last.
Why not?
It's a rebound.
We were a rebound, and we lasted six years.
Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?
Can I check my messages? I have a calling card.
Sorry, it's just that...
You said there are advantages to being single. I want to know what the advantages are.
Well... This is it.
Listen. I had a great time.
Me too.
I would love to see you again sometime.
I'll be around.
That's not good enough. I want to make plans to see you.
You're a comedian?
Yeah. And an actor.
I'll have to come see you sometime.
If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.
It's not going to well?
When I lived in New York they made it sound like they were giving out sit-coms to stand-ups at the airport. I got off the plane in L.A. six months ago and all I got to show for it is a tan.
Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?
...Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into...
Neither is acting. Not if you're serious about it. Can I have one of these?
Why, you like the duck with the cigar?
Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right?
Good eye. Not one club owner got it. They all ask me why I got Donald Duck on my card.
Well, I should be getting...
...It's really getting late.
Can I give you a ride to your car...?
...Nah. I'm right across the street...
...Which one...?
...The red piece of shit over there...
...well, it suits you...
Hello?
Hi, Mike?
Lorraine?
Are you on the other line?
Yeah, hold on.
I can call back...
Hi. Sorry about that.
You didn't have to get off the other line. I would've called you back.
Hi, Lorraine. Thanks for holding on.
How's it going? It's been a while...
...Six months.
How are you doing?
Fine... I guess. You?
Good. I think about things.
Yeah?
Yeah.
What kind of things?
You know, us.
I thought you met someone else.
It doesn't matter. I think about you every day.
Really?
I miss you, Mike.
Why didn't you call?
I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...
...the Michelin commercial...
...Yeah, with the baby in the tire. One time I started to cry right in front of Pierre...
Pierre... That's his name? Pierre? Is he French?
Hi.
I heard you might be moving back...
Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon... Listen, can I call you right back? I gotta take this call...
I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
I really want to catch up with you, but I've gotta take this call. They're holding. I'll talk with you when you get back in town. Bye.
And what if I don't want to give up on her?
You don't call.
But you said I shouldn't call if I wanted to give up on her.
Right.
So I don't call either way.
Right.
So what's the difference?
The only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back. See, you can't do anything to make her want to come back. You can only do things to make her not want to come back.
So the only difference is if I forget about her or pretend to forget about her.
Right.
Well that sucks.
It sucks.
So it's almost a retroactive decision. So I could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her.
Right... or more likely the opposite.
Right... Wait, what do you mean?
I mean first you'll pretend not to care, not call -- whatever, and then, eventually, you really won't care.
Unless she comes back first.
Ah, see, that's the thing. Somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore.
There's the rub.
There's the rub.
Thanks, man. Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time...
Hey man, don't sweat it.
...It's just that you've been there. Your advice really helps.
No problem.
Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her.
I don't think I'm gonna take it.
It's a gig.
I mean, I need the money.
You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.
It's definitely a step back for me.
Look, there's not much of a call for Shakespeare in this town.
There's just something about being "Goofy". Any other Disney character would be fine. There's just this stigma associated with the character.
What do you want? You're tall.
Do you realize how hard it's going to be to tell my parents? I still haven't told them I didn't get the pilot.
You tested over a month ago. I'm sure they figured it out by now.
Haven't you noticed I didn't mention Michelle once today?
I didn't want to say anything.
Why?
I don't know. It's like not talking to a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter.
What? Like, you didn't want to jinx it?
Kinda.
I don't talk about her that much.
Oh no?
I didn't mention her once today.
The only reason I mentioned her at all is to say that I'm not going to talk about her anymore. I thought you'd appreciate that.
I do. Good for you, man.
You want to hit the town tonight?
I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.
What do you have? A Pluto call back?
How many strokes?
I don't know. Eight or Nine.
I'll give you an eight.
What'd you get?
An eight.
So, if the party starts at eight, why are we first going to a bar at ten?
To get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven.
Oh. Where is this place?
It's one of these. For some reason, cool bars in L.A. have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front.
That doesn't sound too good for business.
It's kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing. It's kinda cool. It's like you're in on some kind of secret. You tell a chick you've been some place, it's like bragging that you know how to find it. The only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there. You have to have someone come before. There
Sounds more like Aids...
Kinda money, huh?
I'll get a Dewars rocks...
Bud.
I can't get over how cute the girls in this city are.
I know. It's like the opposite of inbreeding. The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool.
Darwinism at its best.
I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it.
It's like, every day I see a beautiful woman. I'm not used to that. I'm used to seeing a beautiful woman, I don't know, once a week. I can't handle it.
Wait till summer. I swear, you can't leave the house. It hurts. It physically hurts.
I can't wait till I actually get to touch one of them.
Ah, there's the rub...
Charles and me went to network on this pilot together.
I just tested for one...
...What's the big deal? Everyone steals from everyone.
What's that guy's name? Sue?
Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.
Oh, like that song...
..."A Boy Named Sue". I think that's why he's such a bad cat.
Him?
There are so many beautiful women here.
It's unbelievable.
I got to at least try once.
You're a better man than I am, Charlie Brown.
No, I just promised myself I'd give it a try. I gotta get out there sooner or later.
I'm going in. Will you be my wing- man?
Thanks, man.
You haven't been drinking, have you?
Sorry about what happened at the Dresden. I had no idea...
You want to talk about it?
What's the point?
Uuuuugh!
Oh boy.
I'm such an asshole.
I think I'm gonna move Back East.
Well, that's dumb.
What's dumb about it?
Well, you're doing so well...
How am I doing well? I host an open mike and I played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie. Big fuckin' deal. I'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians. How good am I doing?
At least you didn't get turned down for Goofy...
They turned you down?
See, it's all how you look at it. If your life sucks, then mine is God awful. I mean, I moved out here partially because I saw how well you were doing. You got in the union, you got an agent. I thought if you could make it, maybe I could too...
I didn't make it...
Then why won't she call...?
Because you left, man. She's got her own world to deal with in New York. She was a sweet girl but fuck her. You gotta move on. You gotta let go of the past. The future is so beautiful. Every day is so sunny out here. It's like Manifest Destiny man. I mean, we made it. What's past is prologue. That which does not
How did you get over it? I mean how long 'til it stopped hurting?
You miss the pain?
...for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long.
Wow. You wanna grab a bite?
By the way, the guys back home said she put on some weight.
You little bitch!
You should play another team. The Kings are bitches in this game.
It's kinda money, actually.
Make someone bleed.
Pause it.
...which means no one will get there 'til ten.
What's he do?
...How can you compare them? Tarantino totally bites everything from Scorsese...
Who threw this party, anyway?
How's it going for you two?
Not well.
Big butt... you know, can't fly coach.
She was cute.
He's a bitch. He ain't gonna do nothing.
You asshole. Why are you carrying a gun? What? In case someone steps to you, Snoop Dogg?
Yeah. Here it's easier to avoid trouble. It's not like you like in Compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day. Nobody's mugging you on no subway. In New York the trouble finds you. Out here you gotta go look for it...
You live in such a fantasy world...
What about you, Mikey? At least I got balls. You're always whining about some bitch who dumped you a year ago...
...It was six months, and she didn't dump...
I'm so sorry, man. You were so right. I got rid of the gun
What are they doing here?
But most important, man, I'm sorry about what I said. I was drunk... My adrenaline was going...
Don't sweat it, man. I needed a kick in the ass. We're better friends for it.
Thanks, man. I've been hating myself for the last two days.
Good for you, man. He's being smart.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leaves a message.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message.
Hi, Nikki. Mike. I don't think this is working out. I think you're great, but maybe we should just take some time off from each other. It's not you, really. It's me. It's only been six months...
Mike?
Nikki! Great! Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along?
Don't call me ever again.
There you two are. I walked around for an hour with that stupid martini on my tray.
Are you ready to order?
Coffee... Two coffees. It says "Breakfast Any Time", right?
That's right.
Excuse me. We're in a bit of a hurry.
Hello?
S'up Trent?
That was Sue. We got two parties tonight. One's for a modeling agency.
I don't know...
Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
Trent, I don't feel like going out tonight. I got shit to do tomorrow...
Listen to you. I got an audition for a pilot at nine and I'm going. You gotta get out with some beautiful babies. You can't sit home thinking about her.
I don't know...
I don't know, I don't know -- listen to you. We're gonna have fun tonight. We gotta get you out of that stuffy apartment.
We're gonna spend half the night driving around the Hills looking for this party and then leaving cause it sucks, then we're gonna look for this other party you heard about. But, Trent, all the parties and bars, they all suck. I spend half the night trying to talk to some girl who's eyes are darting around to see if there's someone else she
You got it bad, baby. You need Vegas.
What are you talking about? Vegas?
VEGAS.
What Vegas?
We're going to Vegas.
When?
Tonight, baby.
You're crazy.
I'll pick you up in a half an hour.
I'm not going to Vegas.
I can't lose more than a hundred.
Just bring your card. Half an hour.
Wait.
What?
What are you wearing? I mean, we should wear suits.
Oh... Now Mikey wants to be a high roller.
No, seriously, if you're dressed nice and you act like you gamble a lot, they give you free shit.
Okay Bugsy. Twenty minutes.
Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.
I took out three hundred, but I'm only gonna bet with one. I figure if we buy a lot of chips, the pit boss will see and they'll comp us all sorts of shit, then we trade back the chips at the end of the night. You gotta be cool though.
I'm cool, baby. They're gonna give Daddy a room, some breakfast, maybe Bennett's singing.
I'm serious. This is how you do it. I'm telling you.
I know. Daddy's gonna get the Rainman suite. Vegas, baby. We're going to Vegas!
Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight?
Baby, we're gonna be up by five hundy by midnight. Vegas, baby!
Vegas, baby!
Vegas.
Wake up, baby.
Whu?
Pirates of the fucking Caribbean.
This is the hot new place, besides, you love pirates. Tell me Mikey doesn't love pirates.
This is fuckin' post-pubescent Disneyland.
This place is dead. I thought this was the city that never sleeps.
That's New York, baby. You should know that. Look at the waitresses. I'm gonna get me a peg-leg baby.
They're all skanks.
Baby, there are beautiful babies here.
Tee, the beautiful babies don't work Wednesdays midnight to six. This is the skank shift.
Cut that shit out.
She smiled baby.
That's not cool.
Did she, or did she not smile?
It doesn't matter...
I'm telling you, they love that shit.
You're gonna screw up our plan.
We're gonna get laid, baby.
First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
Don't make fun, I think we can get some free shit if we don't fuck around.
Who's fucking around? I'm not making fun. Let's do it, baby.
The trick is to look like you don't need it, then they give you shit for free.
That's where we make our scene.
You think they're watching?
Double down.
What?!?
Double down, baby. You gotta double down on an eleven.
I know, but...
You gotta do it.
...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...
I'm telling you, baby, you always double down on an eleven.
Yeah? Well obviously not always!
Always, baby.
I'm just saying, not in this particular case.
Always.
...Well, you know, not counting the first table.
Thanks for clarifying that.
Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
Yea, how much?
I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe.
Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop?
Twenty... but I was down at least fifty. I'm sorry, I got hot at the crap table.
You won. There's nothing to be sorry about. You're a winner. I'm the fuckin loser. I should be sorry.
Baby, don't talk like that, baby.
Let's just leave.
Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
Let's go.
Mikey's the big winner.
What an asshole.
What an asshole.
That was money. Tell me that wasn't money.
That was so demeaning...
She smiled, baby.
I can't believe what an asshole you are.
Did she, or did she not smile.
She was smiling at what an asshole you are.
She was smiling at how money I am, baby.
Let's go. I'm not paying for a room, and if we don't leave now we'll never make it.
Leave? The honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails.
What are you, nuts? You think she's coming back?
I know she's coming back.
I don't think so.
Baby, did you hear her? "You shouldn't leave without getting something for free." She wants to party, baby.
You think so?
You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good with the ladies.
I'm too tired for this. Let's just go.
Baby, this is what we came for. We met a beautiful baby and she likes you.
She likes you.
Whatever. We'll see. Daddy's gonna get her to bring a friend. We'll both get one. I don't care if I'm with her or one of her beautiful baby friends.
I don't know...
You gotta get that girl out of your head. It's time to move on. You're a stylish, successful, good looking cat. The ladies want to love you, you just gotta let them.
That's bullshit.
It's not. You're money. Any of these ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like you.
It's just that I've been out of the game so long. Trent, I was with her for six years. That's before AIDS. I'm scared. I don't know how to talk to them, I don't know...
You can't think like that, baby. It's hard, I know. I've been there. Not for six years, but I know. You just gotta get back out there.
It's just tough, after sleeping with someone you love for so long, to be with someone new... who doesn't know what I like... and you gotta wear a jimmy...
...gotta...
...and then I'm struggling to impress some chick who's not half as classy as my girlfriend, who I'm not even really attracted to...
That was so fuckin' money. It was like that "Jedi mind" shit.
That's what I'm telling you, baby. The babies love that stuff. They don't want all that sensitive shit. You start talking to them about puppy dogs and ice cream. They know what you want. What do you think? You think they don't?
I know. I know.
They know what you want, believe me. Pretending is just a waste of time. You're gonna take them there eventually anyway. Don't apologize for it.
I'm just trying to be a gentleman, show some respect...
Nice, baby.
I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head.
Baby, you did fine.
"Age of Enlightenment". Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones."...
...Baby...
...It's just, I thought "Renaissance" was too Excaliber, it's the wrong casino. She would've gotten it, though...
You did fine. Don't sweat her. We're meeting our honeys soon. You know Christy's friend is going to be money.
I hope so. We gotta go soon.
Baby, relax. It's just down the hall. She's gotta change... we'll be fine.
We didn't do so bad after all.
I'm Mike... and this is my friend "Doubledown Trent".
Whatever.
Oh... a Dorothy.
What was the part?
Oh... "I love you... I can't believe you're doing this... Drugs are bad..." Whatever. After-School bullshit. The role is Brother.
"Big Brother", "Little Brother"?
Wait... Wait... Just "Brother". So I go in. "Hello... Hi... We loved your guest spot on Baywatch... blah blah blah..." Whatever. So, I start to read, and, Mikey, I was money. I prepared for a week. It's a starring role. I'm crying... The casting director, she starts crying...
No!
Wait... She's crying. I finish. I hold up my finger like "Wait a second". They sit in silence for, like, at least five minutes. I look up and they all start clapping, and now they're all crying. Even the camera guy.
No! Not the camera guy!
...So give me the fuckin part...
Right?... that I nailed it... Whatever. Then he says it's just that I'm a little old. I'm like "How old is the Brother?". He's like, he says this with a straight face, I swear to God, he says "Eleven."
No, man. I need to use the phone.
What?
I gotta use the phone.
Baby, you'll check them tomorrow.
Please, Tee. I have to use the phone. Sorry, man.
She asked me what I was thinking about? What should I have done? Lie?
You didn't have to get into it, baby.
Sorry about interrupting...
Don't worry about me, baby. I just wanted you to have a good time.
Christy was nice...
I didn't even like her, to be honest.
She was hot.
She really didn't do it for me, baby. How'd you like Dorothy?
I don't know. The whole Judy Garland thing kind of turned me on. Does that makes me some kind of fag?
No, baby. You're money.
She didn't like me, anyway.
She thought you were money.
I don't think so.
I heard them talking. They both thought you were money.
Yeah, a good friend.
Baby, you take yourself out of the game. You start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream, of course it's gonna be on the friend tip.
I just don't think she liked me in that way.
Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.
Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you.
Michelle went for you, right.
That was different.
How?
I was younger... It was college. You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like. You screw chicks you have no business being with. They're young, they don't know any better.
That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, baby.
I just need some time...
Why? So you can beat yourself up? Sitting around in that stuffy apartment. It's just plain bad for you, man. It's depressing. You've come so far. Remember the first week? After she told you? You couldn't even eat.
Don't remind me.
You just sat around drinking orange juice. Now look at you. Look how far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie...
...a day...
...Whatever. It's work. You're doing what you love. What's she doing?
Selling scrap metal.
See? And what does this guy she's with do?
He drives a carriage.
What?!?
I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
Please. And you're sweating him? You're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey?
I hear she's getting real fat.
I wish the game still had fights so I could bitch-slap Wayne.
This version doesn't have fighting?
No. Doesn't that suck?
No.
You guys are such assholes.
What time's this party tonight?
Who? Rob?
Yeah. You met him once.
...the Copa, in New York...
...Maybe. I mean you gotta hide all the lights...
How you guys doing?
It's on.
Which one?
What are you doing?
What?
You looked right at her, baby.
I'm sorry.
Was I money?
I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
Why, baby? What'd I do wrong?
You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up.
She didn't see.
We got the digits, baby.
What a surprise.
Please, don't mess with me right now...
You're not just, like, fucking with me?
How long do I wait to call?
A day.
Tomorrow?
So, two days?
What the fuck..?
You were off your ass back there! Where the hell did you learn to do all that twirly whirly shit?
I took a ballroom class with Michelle. I never danced with anyone but her, til tonight. That Lorraine chick is good.
It's not like that...
Don't give me that! She liked you, man.
Guys... Guys... I got it under control.
Bitch... You little bitch!
Because he's a bitch.
...against the computer.
They're a finesse team...
They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!
I don't know. I guess kids were hitting each other or something.
You could make their heads bleed, though.
Is he cute? Ask him if he wants to stay for a cocktail!
What a surprise...
Oh, it's on, baby...
Is she looking at me, baby?
No.
Now?
No.
Is she looking now?
No! She's not looking at you. She hasn't looked at you once. Will you stop asking if... Wait, she just looked.
Yes she did.
That was pretty cold, dude.
It's on.
You think?
Baby, I know it is. It's a black diamond trail...
...double diamond...
...but it's worth the risk. True or false: It's worth the risk.
Baby, don't talk that way, baby...
You are so money, and you don't even know it...
...we're not...
You're like this big bear with claws and fangs...
...and big fuckin' teeth...
...and teeth... And she's like this little bunny cowering in the corner...
...shivering...
...And you're just looking at your claws like "How do I kill this bunny?"...
...You're just poking at it...
...Yeah. You're just gently batting it around... and the rabbit's all scared...
...and you got big claws and fangs...
...and fangs... and you're like "I don't know what to do. How do I kill this bunny?"...
...honestly...
...you're money...
...you're so fuckin mmmoney.
Now go over there and get those digits.
You're money.
...Tomorrow, then a day.
Definitely. Two days. That's the industry standard...
...I used to wait two days. Now everyone waits two days. Three days is kinda money now, don't you think?
...Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious...
Laugh all you want, but if you call to soon you can scare off a nice baby who's ready to party.
You dick.
...Anaheim...
...Oh, who would jack your fuckin K- car? He's right, Sue. You don't need no gat.
Listen. Just because I was the only one with the balls to stand up to them...
...Sue...
Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
...Shut up, Sue...
I know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. You're like a little whiney bitch...
It's on...
It's on.
It is on.
Sorry man.
Yeah. You probably coulda hit that tonight if you didn't have to drive us home.
The bear's got his claws back.
Be smart about it.
I'm telling you. Wait three days...
You don't have to wait three days...
...Okay, two...
...Well, then, I guess we don't have to worry about him anymore.
...One fifty-nine, Two minutes.
Two vodka martinis, straight up, shaken not stirred, very dry, easy on the water.
Beautiful. What time are you off... ...Christy?
And you?
I'll have the Blackbeard over easy.
Yes, I understand. I'm listening.
Anything...Anything the Godfather wishes.
Good. He never doubted you.
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
This is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for Don Corleone, at his request.
Yes, I understand I'm listening.
Bonasera, we know each other for years, but this is the first time you come to me for help. I don't remember the last time you invited me to your house for coffee...even though our wives are friends.
What do you want of me? I'll give you anything you want, but do what I ask!
No. You ask for too much.
I ask for Justice.
The Court gave you justice.
An eye for an eye!
But your daughter is still alive.
You never think to protect yourself with real friends. You think it's enough to be an American. All right, the Police protects you, there are Courts of Law, so you don't need a friend like me. But now you come to me and say Don Corleone, you must give me justice. And you don't ask in respect or friendship. And you don't think to
America has been good to me...
Be my friend.
Good. From me you'll get Justice.
Godfather.
What do you wish me to do?
Understood. I just wish I was doing more to help out.
Jesus, Connie...Sure, Mike...
Godfather!
You fingered Sonny for the Barzini people. That little farce you played out with my sister. Did Barzini kid you that would fool a Corleone?
I swear I'm innocent. I swear on the head of my children, I'm innocent. Mike, don't do this to me, please Mike, don't do this to me!
Don't be frightened. Do you think I'd make my sister a widow? Do you think I'd make your children fatherless? After all, I'm Godfather to your son. No, your punishment is that you're out of the family business. I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas--and I want you to stay there. I'll send Connie an allowance, that's all. But don't keep saying you're
Barzini.
What's the matter, Carlo?
What was that?
You're staying home. You're not going out.
The food is on the table.
I'm not hungry yet.
Eat it, it's on the table.
Ba Fa Goulle.
You filthy guinea spoiled brat. Clean it up or I'll kick your head in.
You heard about your father?
Yeah.
The word is out in the streets that he's dead.
Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don?
Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
Maybe three, four times. I always asked Freddie if he wanted another bodyguard, but he said no. Things have been so smooth the last ten years...
Go get Paulie, I don't care how sick he is. Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house.
That's all? Don't you want me to send some people over here?
Clemenza. You take care of Paulie. I don't ever want to see him again. Understood?
Understood.
You take care of Paulie?
Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian.
I want somebody very good, very safe to plant that gun. I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hand.
The gun will be there.
You're on, kid...I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left. And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right.
Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse to change their identification when we make them see the light. Then you take a long vacation and we catch the hell.
How bad will it be?
We gotta fight sometime. Let us at least recruit our regimes to full strength.
He's going to be our lawyer in Vegas. Nobody goes to him with any other business as of now, this minute. No reflection on Tom; that's the way I want it. Besides, if I ever need any advice, who's a better Consigliere than my father.
Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
You look terrif on the floor!
I tol' you to stay put, Paulie...
Outside.
I'll think about it.
Good for ten men...
You think we'll go for that last place?
Maybe, or you gotta know now.
My business is heroin, I have poppy fields, laboratories in Narseilles and Sicily, ready to go into production. My importing methods are as safe as these things can be, about five per cent loss. The risk is nothing, the profits enormous.
Why do you come to me? Why do I deserve your generosity?
I need two million dollars in cash...more important, I need a friend who has people in high places; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested, they would get only light sentences. Be my friend.
What percentages for my family?
Thirty per cent. In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up.
My compliments. I'll take care of them from my share.
So. I receive 30 per cent just for finance and legal protection. No worries about operations, is that what you tell me?
No...how a man makes his living is none of my business. But this proposition of yours is too risky. All the people in my family lived well the last ten years, I won't risk that out of greed.
Are you worried about security for your million?
No.
I kept trying to call you after my divorce and Tom always said you were busy. When I got the Wedding invitation I knew you weren't sore at me anymore, Godfather.
Can I do something for you still? You're not too rich, or too famous that I can't help you?
All right, Hollywood...Now tell me about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta who won't let you work.
You take care of your family?
You look terrible. I want you to eat well, to rest. And spend time with your family. And then, at the end of the month, this big shot will give you the part you want.
It's too late. All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot.
Is it necessary?
I'm sure it's the most generous gift today.
He's his own boss, and very competent.
And with prison record.
Two terms; one in Italy, one in the United States. He's known to the Government as a top narcotics man. That could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify.
When did he call?
This morning.
It is Johnny. He came all the way from California to be at the wedding.
Should I bring him in.
No. Let the people enjoy him. You see? He is a good godson.
When does my daughter leave with her bridegroom?
They'll cut the cake in a few minutes...leave right after that. Your new son-in-law, do we give him something important?
No, give him a living. But never let him know the family's business. What else, Tom?
What is this nonsense?
My wife was weeping before she fell asleep, outside my window I saw my caporegimes to the house, and it is midnight. So, Consigliere of mine, I think you should tell your Don what everyone knows.
I didn't tell Mama anything. I was about to come up and wake you and tell you. Just now.
But you needed a drink first.
Yes.
When I meet with Tattaglia's people; should I insist that all his drug middle-men be clean?
Mention it, don't insist. Barzini is a man who will know that without being told.
You mean Tattaglia.
Barzini.
He was the one behind Sollozzo?
Tom, I never thought you were a bad Consigliere, I thought Santino a bad Don, rest in peace. He had a good heart but he wasn't the right man to head the family when I had my misfortune. Michael has all my confidence, as you do. For reasons which you can't know, you must have no part in what will happen.
Will your girl friend get back to the city all right?
What was this for?
For bravery.
And this?
For killing a man.
What miracles you do for strangers.
I fought for my country. It was my choice.
And now, what do you choose to do?
I'm going to finish school.
Have you thought about a wife? A family?
No.
I understand, Michael. But you must make a family, you know.
I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
Accept what's happened, Michael.
I could accept everything that's happened; I could accept it, but that I never had a choice. From the time I was born, you had laid this all out for me.
No, I wanted other things for you.
You wanted me to be your son.
Yes, but sons who would be professors, scientists, musicians...and grandchildren who could be, who knows, a Governor, a President even, nothing's impossible here in America.
Then why have I become a man like you?
You are like me, we refuse to be fools, to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men. I hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over. That was my misfortune. That was your misfortune. I was hunted on the streets of Corleone when I was twelve years old because of who my father was. I had no choice.
A man has to choose what he will be. I believe that.
I told you that it wouldn't escape his eye.
I see you have your Luca Brasi.
I'll need him.
Barzini will move against you first.
How?
Your wife and children...you're happy with them?
Yes.
...a fine boy from Sicily, captured by the American Army, and sent to New Jersey as a prisoner of war...
Nazorine, my friend, tell me what I can do.
Now that the war is over, Enzo, this boy is being repatriated to Italy. And you see, Godfather... He...my daughter...they...
You want him to stay in this country.
Godfather, you understand everything.
Tom, what we need is an Act of Congress to allow Enzo to become a citizen.
Don Tommassino.
Michael, why must you do this. We have been lucky so far, all these months you've been here we've kept your name a secret. It is from love for your father that I've asked you never to more than an hour from the Villa.
Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen.
You must understand that your Father's enemies have friends in Palermo.
I know.
Where are you going?
Corleone.
There is nothing there. Not anymore.
I was told that my Grandfather was murdered on its main street; and his murderers came to kill my father there when he was twelve years old.
Long ago. Now there is nothing: the men killed each other in family vendettas...the others escaped to America.
That is your birthright...but Michael, use this car.
Things went badly in Palermo?
The younger men have no respect. Things are changing; I don't know what will happen. Michael, because of the wedding, people now know your name.
Is that why there are more men on the walls?
Even so, I don't think it is safe here anymore. I've made plans to move you to a villa near Siracuse. You must go right away.
What is it?
You tell us about America.
How do you know I come from America?
We hear. We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot.
Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.
Hey America! Is she as rich as they say?
Yes.
Hey, beautiful girls!
Get the car. I'll be leaving in ten minutes. Where's Calo?
Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen. Is your wife coming with you?
You had better bring a few bottles home with you, my friend; you'll need help sleeping tonight.
This one could seduce the devil. A body! and eyes as big and black as olives.
I know about what you mean!
This was a beauty. Right, Calo?
Beautiful all over, eh?
It's the real Thunderbolt, then.
Why didn't Moe Green meet us at the airport?
You look wonderful, kid; really wonderful. That doctor did some job on your face.
Ever seen anything like that before?
Mike! The party starting!
Who are those girls?
That's for you to find out.
Give them some money and send them home.
Mike!
Mike, you sure about Moe selling. He never mentioned it to me and he loves the business.
Tom, you're the Consigliere; you can talk to the Don and advise him.
The old man wants you; Johnny's here...he's got a problem.
Is the hospital covered?
What about Luca? Sollozzo didn't seem worried about Luca. That worries me.
If Luca sold out we're in real trouble.
Has anyone been able to get in touch with him?
No, and I've been calling all night. Maybe he's shacked up.
Tom, you're the Consigliere, what do we do if the old man dies?
Without your father's political contacts and personal influence, the Corleone family loses half its strength. Without your father, the other New York families might wind up supporting Sollozzo, and the Tattaglias just to make sure there isn't a long destructive war. The old days are over, this is 1946; nobody wants bloodshed anymore. If your father dies...make the deal, Sonny.
That's easy to say; it's not your father.
I was as good a son to him as you or Mike.
Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way.
We're all tired...
Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up in this so directly. You know the old man doesn't want that.
Was there a definite proposal?
Sure, he wants us to send Mike to meet him to hear his proposition. The promise is the deal will be so good we can't refuse.
What about that Tattaglias? What will they do about Bruno?
Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.
We should hear what they have to say.
No, no Consiglere. Not this time. No more meetings, no more discussions, no more Sollozzo tricks. Give them one message: I WANT SOLLOZZO. If not, it's all out war. We go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street.
The other families won't sit still for all out war.
Then THEY hand me Sollozzo.
Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this. This is not a personal thing, this is Business.
And when they shot me father...
Yes, even the shooting of your father was business, not personal...
I found out about this Captain McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw. He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll, and for big money. McCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's bodyguard. What you have to understand is that while Sollozzo is guarded like this, he's invulnerable. Nobody has ever gunned down a New York Police Captain. Never. It would be disastrous. All the five families would come after
One of Tattaglia's people?
Jesus, I don't know...
Pop, they hit us and we hit them back.
We'll let the old man take it easy for a couple of weeks. I want to get things going good before he gets better. What's the matter with you?
You start operating, the five families will start their raids again. We're at a stalemate Sonny, your war is costing us a lot of money.
No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me.
Yes. That's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation.
Kay, we weren't expecting you. You should call...
I've tried calling and writing. I want to reach Michael.
What was that?
An accident. No one was hurt.
Will you give this to him.
Will you give this letter to Michael.
Sonny was hot for my deal, right? You know it's the smart thing to do, too. I want you to talk Sonny into it.
The Don was slipping; in the old days I could never have gotten to him. Now he's dead, nothing can bring him back. Talk to Sonny, talk to the Caporegimes, Clemenza and Tessio...it's good business.
Even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi.
I'll worry about Luca. You take care of Sonny and the other two kids.
I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.
Mr. Corleone is Johnny's Godfather. That is very close, a very sacred religious relationship.
Okay, but just tell him this is one favor I can't give. But he should try me again on anything else.
He never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first. Understood?
You smooth son of a bitch, let me lay it on the line for you, and your boss. Johnny Fontane never gets that movie. I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball Goombahs come out of the woodwork!
I'm German-Irish.
Hello Kay. Your father's inside, doing some business. He's been asking for you.
Sure. Anything I can do for you.
No. I guess I'll see you Christmas. Everyone's going to be out at Long Beach, right?
What about McCluskey?
Mike, why are you cutting me out of the action?
Tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man. What could be more important than that.
Bookkeepers know everything. Rocco's men are all a little too good for the jobs they're supposed to be doing. They get a little more money than the job's worth. Lampone's a good man; he's operating perfectly.
Not so perfectly if you noticed.
Mike, why am I out?
You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying.
Christ, Tom; I needed more time with him. I really needed him.
Did he give you his politicians?
Not all...I needed another four months and I would have had them all. I guess you've figured it all out?
How will they come at you?
I know now. I'll make them call me Don.
Have you agreed on a meeting?
I've never seen anything like it.
Michael, what are those men doing?
They're waiting to see my father.
They're talking to themselves.
They're going to talk to my father, which means they're going to ask him for something, which means they better get it right.
Why do they bother him on a day like this?
No. His name is Luca Brasi. You wouldn't like him.
Who is he?
You really want to know?
Yes. Tell me.
You like spaghetti?
You know I love spaghetti.
Once upon a time, about fifteen years ago some people wanted to take over my father's olive oil business. They had Al Capone send some men in from Chicago to kill my father, and they almost did.
Al Capone!
My Father sent Luca Brasi after them. He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off...
Michael...
Then the legs at the knees...
Michael you're trying to scare me...
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
Then Luca turned to the other man...
Michael, I love you.
I never know when you're telling me the truth.
I told you you wouldn't like him.
Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay Adams.
How do you do.
If he's your brother, why does he have a different name?
I didn't know your family knew Johnny Fontane.
Sure.
I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off.
We have something for your mother, for Sonny, we have the tie for Fredo and Tom Hagen gets the Reynolds pen...
And what do you want for Christmas?
What will your father say?
As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object. He'll be hurt, but he won't object.
What time do they expect us?
For dinner. Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire.
Michael.
Michael, what are you doing?
Shhh, you be the long distance operator. Here.
Would you like me better if I were a nun?
No.
Michael?
I'm thinking about it.
Michael...
Hello. Kay?
How is your father?
He'll be OK.
I LOVE YOU.
Yeah Kay, I'm here.
Can you say it?
Huh?
I can't...
Please say it.
Look. I'll see you tonight, OK?
Visiting hour ends at eight thirty. I'll just sit with him; I want to show respect.
Can I go to the hospital with you?
I don't think so. You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News.
My parents don't read the Daily News. All right, if you think I shouldn't. I can't believe the things the papers are printing. I'm sure most of it's not true.
I don't think so either. I better go.
When will I see you again?
When will I see you again?
I have to see my father and his people when we get back to the Mall.
Oh Michael.
We'll go to the show tomorrow night--we can change the tickets.
Don't you want dinner first?
No, you eat...don't wait up for me.
Your sister wants to ask you something.
Why are you so cold to her and Carlo? They live with us on the Mall now, but you never get close to them.
I'm busy.
Will you?
Michael, it's not true. Please tell me.
Don't ask me.
Tell me!
All right, this one time I'll let you ask about my affairs, one last time.
I'm Michael Corleone--this is my father. What happened to the detectives who were guarding him?
Oh your father just had too many visitors. It interfered with the hospital service. The police came and made them all leave just ten minutes ago. But don't worry. I look in on him.
You cannot stay here...I'm sorry.
You and I are going to move my father right now...to another room on another floor...Can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?
Absolutely not! We have to get permission from the Doctor.
You've read about my father in the papers. You've seen that no one's here to guard him. Now I've just gotten word that men are coming to this hospital to kill him. Believe me and help me.
I was worried when we couldn't get in touch with you in that hick town.
How's Mom?
Good. She's been through it before. Me too. You were too young to know about it. You better wait outside; there're some things you shouldn't hear.
I can help you out...
Oh no you can't, the old man'd be sore as hell if I let you get mixed up in this.
Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.
All right, Mikey...who do we have to hit, Clemenza or Paulie?
What?
Clemenza? No, I don't believe it.
You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie.
How can you be sure?
Is it going to be all-out war, like last time?
Until the old man tells me different.
Then wait, Sonny. Talk to Pop.
Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't care what it costs. I don't care if we have to fight all the five families in New York. The Tattaglia family's going to eat dirt. I don't care if we all go down together.
That's not how Pop would have played it.
I know I'm not the man he was. But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too. When it comes to real action, I can operate as good as anybody short range.
All right, Sonny. All right.
Christ, if I could only contact Luca.
Where are you going?
To the city.
Send some bodyguards.
Sonny...Sonny--Jesus Christ, I'm down at the hospital. I came down late. There's no one here. None of Tessio's people--no detectives, no one. The old man is completely unprotected.
All right, get him in a different room; lock the door from the inside. I'll have some men there inside of fifteen minutes. Sit tight, and don't panic.
Mikey, you look beautiful!
Cut it out.
We can't wait. No matter what Sollozzo say about a deal, he's figuring out how to kill Pop. You have to get Sollozzo now.
Go on Mike.
Why don't you stop living like a bum and get this place cleaned up.
What are you, inspecting the barracks? You ready? Did Clemenza tell you be sure to drop the gun right away?
A million times.
O.K. How long do you think before I can come back?
I'm glad you came, Mike. I hope we can straighten everything out. All this is terrible, it's not the way I wanted things to happen at all. It should never have happened.
I want to settle things tonight. I want my father left alone.
We're going to New Jersey?
Most important...I want a sure guarantee that no more attempts will be made on my father's life.
What is it?
Do you pledge to guide and protect this child if he is left fatherless? Do you promise to shield him against the wickedness of the world?
Do you renounce Satan.
I do renounce him.
And all his works?
Do you wish to be baptized?
Barzini's people chisel my territory and we do nothing about it. Pretty soon there won't be one place in Brooklyn I can hang my hat.
Just be patient.
I'm not asking you for help, Mike. Just take off the handcuffs.
Let us fill up our Regimes.
No. I want things very calm for another six months.
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting. Says we can straighten any of our problems out.
He talked to you?
Mike, good to see you. Got everything you want?
Thanks.
The chef cooked for you special; the dancers will kick your tongue out and you credit is good! Draw chips for all these people so they can play on the house.
Buy me out?...
The Corleone family wants to buy me out. I buy you out. You don't buy me out.
Your casino loses money. Maybe we can do better.
You think I scam?
You're unlucky.
You goddamn dagos. I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out.
You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino. You and the Corleone family are evened out. This is for business; name your price.
The Corleone family don't have that kind of muscle anymore. The Godfather is sick. You're getting chased out of New York by Barzini and the other families, and you think you can find easier pickings here. I've talked to Barzini; I can make a deal with him and keep my hotel!
You straightened my brother out?
I have to go back to New York tomorrow. Think of your price.
Yeah.
Do you recognize my voice?
I think so. Detective squad?
Right. Don't say my name, just listen. Somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago.
Is he alive?
I think so, but I can't get close enough. There's a lot of blood. I'll try to find out more.
How do you do.
You should come and have lunch with us, before you go -- Dickie?
Sure. Any time.
Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late, I'm a swine.
Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
I just woke up. I'm sorry.
You just woke up!
Fausto and I -- we took the boat out, we were fishing, and then it was dawn and we'd caught absolutely nothing.
Well, we ate everything without you.
We?
Tom was telling me about his trip over. Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed.
Is that good?
I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.
What? What?
Uncanny!
Hi Tom.
Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.
I'll come down.
Okay, we're going to Naples. There's a club, it's not a club, it's a cellar.
It's vile.
It'll just be for a little while. He can be... he makes me laugh.
Okay, darling.
You'd say if you mind?
No, I like him.
Marge, you like everybody.
I don't like you.
Now you know why Miss Sherwood always shows up for breakfast. It's not love it's the coffee machine.
It's the one task Dickie can do on his own -- make coffee.
Shut up.
Oh darling -- is that for me?
I had to promise, capital P, never to take it off -- otherwise I'd give it to you.
Bastard! Isn't it great, Tom? I found it in Naples. I bargained for about two weeks.
I hope it wasn't cheap.
Dubious but special honor, Tom -- crewing Dickie's boat. Alright, bar's open.
If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom and I are running off together.
He's drowning me!
Well, she was already dead, darling, wasn't she, so I suppose --
Who's this?
It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together.
Okay. And did we know each other?
Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must have known me.
Princeton is like a fog, America's like a fog. This is Marge Sherwood. Tom -- sorry, what was it?
Nothing. Nothing much. Passing through.
Passing through! You're so white. Did you ever see a guy so white, Marge? Gray, actually.
It's just an undercoat.
Say again?
You know, a primer.
Who? Oh, Tom, hello, how are you? We thought you'd disappeared. We were going to send out a search party.
I'm intruding.
Can you mix a martini?
Forging signatures. Telling lies. Impersonating practically anybody.
That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression.
Now? Okay. Wait a minute. Talent -- The only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance.
What? What's this?
I like to sail, believe me, I love to sail! Instead I make boats and other people sail them.
Stop! It's too much! You're making all the hairs on my neck stand up!
Jazz, let's face it, it's just an insolent noise.
I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him?
I met him in New York.
Could you ever conceive of going there, Tom, and bringing him back?
What?
I'm never going back!
No, I think your mother, her illness --
It's got nothing to do with my mother! She's had leukemia for -- ! This is what makes me boil about him! HE wants me back! -- it's got nothing to do with my mother.
I don't know, Dickie, I'm just telling you what I --
You like jazz!
I love jazz.
Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat --
I don't know. What's the name of your sailboat?
Good afternoon!
What time is it? Oh God! Do you always type your letters? That should be two Ts.
I can't write and I can't spell. That's the privilege of a first-class education. You're upstairs at the back. I think Ermelinda made the bed up.
This is so good of you.
You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?
Your parents met her.
I'm doing this wrong, aren't I?
Could we sail to Venice?
Sure. I love Venice.
I have to go to Venice.
See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die, don't you? Okay, Venice is on the list.
And Rome.
You're breaking my ribs!
What?
I could fuck this icebox I love it so much. What were you actually doing in New York?
I played piano in a few places.
That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs.
A few places -- that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York.
The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating. Cold beer. Thank you Dad.
I love the fact you brought Shakespeare with you and no clothes. Ermelinda says you wash the same shirt out every night. Is that true?
No! I've got more than one shirt!
She can do that stuff for you. Anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient.
Without the glasses you're not even ugly. I don't need them because I never read. How do I look.
I know. I write like a child.
Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T, do you see? -- fine, vulnerable -- that's pain, that's secret pain.
It must be a deep secret, cause I don't know about it.
Your handwriting -- nothing more naked. See -- nothing's quite touching the line -- that's vanity.
Do you have any brothers?
No, no brothers, no sisters.
Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in?
No!
I didn't mean with you in it.
What does he say?
He's getting impatient. He wants me to reassure him you'll be home by Thanksgiving.
You've got to get a new jacket. Really. You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm sick of seeing you in them.
I can't. I can't keep spending your father's money.
Where do we find a carozza for the Forum, or can we hire any of them -- ?
Relax.
It's just there's so much to do in a single day.
Relax. The most important question is where to eat. I hope Freddie made a reservation.
Freddie?
Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and meet some friends of Freddie's. The best thing is -- if you want to be a tourist -- grab a cab and we can meet up at the railway station.
What club?
Freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd. Come if you want but I thought you wanted to see the Forum...?
Shoes too?
You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.
Get undressed in your own room, would you?
I thought you'd missed the train.
Freddie drove me back in his car.
Is Freddie here?
He's downstairs.
What's the fight about? That's her fiancee, isn't it? Are they blaming him?
She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do you know what that means in a place like this?
I'm prepared to take the blame.
What are you talking about?
You've been so good to me. You're the brother I never had. I'm the brother you never had.
She came to me for help, she needed money, and I didn't help her. I didn't help her. Now she's dead and it's my fault.
...The thousand dollars, of course, was only due in the event that you succeeded in bringing Dickie home. Naturally, I hope the trip has afforded you some pleasure despite the failure of its main objective you need no longer consider yourself obligated to us in any way...
You can't blame him. You could hardly expect this to go on forever.
I thought you might write again. Now that we're brothers...
I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've had a good run, haven't we?
What about Venice? Can we stick to that plan at least?
To Mongibello and the happiest days of my life.
To Mongi. You're cheerful tonight.
I'm suddenly quite happy to be going back.
That's good.
I've got plans!
Ripley's plans.
Esatto. I'm always planning.
Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I didn't, did I?
Why are you asking all of a sudden?
No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you?
Why?
I mean it as a compliment. You've got such great taste, I don't know. Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. Used to say, the cream of America: rich and thick. Freddie's the perfect example.
Then I'll take it as a compliment.
I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!
Ha.
Do you even like jazz -- or was that something for my benefit?
I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what do you think about drums?
What?
I wanted to tell you my plan.
So tell me.
I thought I might come back. In the New Year. Under my own steam.
Really? To Italy?
Of course. Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here -- perhaps we could split the rent on a house -- I'll get a job -- or, better still, I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here --
Oh God, I don't think so.
You see, particularly with the Marge problem, you can just blame me.
Marge and I are getting married.
How?
How?
Yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace, today you're getting married. It's absurd.
I love Marge.
You love me and you're not marrying me.
Tom, I don't love you.
No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained all of that.
What?
You can be a leech -- you know this -- and it's boring. You can be quite boring.
The funny thing -- I'm not pretending to be somebody else and you are. I'm absolutely honest with you. I've told you my feelings. But you, first of all I know there's something -- that evening when we played chess, for instance, it was obvious --
What evening?
Frederico!
This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles.
Dick -- you've got to hear this!
Come on, Frederico, do you really have to go back? At least stick around for the Festival of the Madonna.
Do you think you can steer this thing?
Sure.
Just point her at Capri and avoid the rocks.
What are you doing?
Marge-maintenance.
Hello?
Dickie?
Who is it?
Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley.
Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?
Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?
I don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm. If you said he was still at lunch I'd believe you. Incredible. The guy has disappeared off the face of the earth.
I guess.
The landlady -- as far as I could tell, the landlady said he was here right now.
He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I can't think why you would imagine Dickie would hide from you.
Because he's been hiding from me -- what happened at Christmas?
What about Christmas?
Of course, he's been very involved in his music, hasn't he? I think his theory is, you know, you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly.
Which is horseshit. Have you heard him play that thing? He can't.
How did you find him? It's such an out of the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?
No. No, I'm staying here for a few days, in Rome. That's a new piano, so you prob --
You should watch that!
In fact the only thing which looks like Dickie is you.
Hardly.
Freddie, do you have something to say?
What? I think I'm saying it. Something's going on. He's either converted to Christianity -- or to something else.
I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself. Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the Corso.
Most enjoyable. Herbert Greenleaf.
Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.
Could you ever conceive of going to Italy, Tom, persuade my son to come home? I'd pay you. I'd pay you 1000 dollars.
I've always wanted to go to Europe, sir, but...
Mr Greenleaf.
Tom. How are you? You look well.
I'm well, thank you.
Far cry from New York.
Yes it is.
Yes. What's the detective hoping to find in San Remo?
He's being thorough, that's all. I'm learning about my son, Tom, now he's missing. I'm learning a great deal about him. I hope you can fill in some more blanks for me. Marge has been good enough to do that, about Mongibello.
No, Marge doesn't know the half of it.
I think it might hurt her to know.
And his passport photo? Did you hear? To scratch out your own face like that -- can you imagine -- the frame of mind you'd have to be in? I've thought about going to the police but I can't face it. I can't face anything anymore.
I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you.
Tom.
Hello, sir. Marge, you should have waited, didn't Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you up?
Marge has been telling us about the rings.
You know I feel ridiculous I didn't mention them yesterday -- I clean forgot -- ridiculous.
I'm going to take Marge for a little walk, Tom. Mr MacCarron wants to talk with you.
We could go down to the bar -- no need for you to --
Pretty good. Sticking with hot water.
Where's Mr MacCarron?
This theory, the letter he left for you, the Police think that's a clear indication he was planning on doing something... to himself.
I just don't believe that!
You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk to Tom alone -- perhaps this afternoon? Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to another fellow --
Such as?
I don't know, I don't know, I just know it.
Thanks so much for inviting me tonight.
Can you bear it? We hear you're a friend of Freddie's -- he has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
There's room for a whole libretto on Freddie's chest.
I was sure we'd met, weren't you, Ted? This is Herbert Greenleaf's boy.
Thanks, yes, I think we did.
Is Mr Greenleaf here?
I could probably see my bedroom from here. I can see my house. When you see where you live from a distance it's like a dream, isn't it?
I don't care for B.S. I don't care to hear it. I don't care to speak it.
Okay.
Mr Greenleaf appreciates your loyalty. He really does. Marge, she's got a hundred theories, but there are a few things she doesn't know. We hope she never knows.
I hope she never knows.
Pleasure to meet you, Dickie's made a fine catch. I know Emily thinks so.
You were right about the telephones. There are no lines, there's some problem.
Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
I never said that!
Which is ridiculous. Boats are female, everyone knows you can't call a boat after a man.
Dickie, you can't even drive a car! No, what we need urgently is an icebox. What do you think, Tom? Agree with me and I'll be your friend for life.
That ring's so great. The green one.
Tom, I love you! See! I bought it for him, for his birthday.
I have to find a birthday present for Frances. Perhaps you can help me?
Frances?
You really should go in, it's marvelous.
Are you okay?
The thing with Dickie -- it's like the sun shines on you and it's glorious, then he forgets you and it's very very cold.
So I'm learning.
Tell me, why is it when men play they always play at killing each other...? I'm sorry about Cortina by the way.
What about Cortina?
Dickie!
I'll go and see what's the matter.
Hello Marge.
Tom, you startled me! You're back.
How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?
Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.
I was just looking at you -- so quiet.
Where's Dickie?
I think he's planning on staying in Rome for a few days.
Ha. Did he say why?
I don't know. I don't understand Dickie, Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.
What does that mean?
Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.
Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
Thanks. He knows I love this, although why it couldn't have waited...
Errand number one -- deliver Marge's perfume. Errand number two, pack some clothes and his precious saxophone.
How long's he staying for?
He hates being confronted.
Oh my God. Tom.
Marge, how are you? What are you doing in Rome?
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
Is he really not here?
Marge, you know Dickie has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
Dickie was at the Opera last night.
I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't drag Dickie to --
He was there with someone. So I suppose she must have dragged him -- that's not fair. I'm going back to Mongi. I think Dickie's coming home. I'm going to go home.
Did he kill Freddie?
Marge, when did you get here?
Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you. What happened to your face?
Dickie did it.
Dickie?
My face! There was an argument. I said some things I shouldn't have. About you. About the appalling way he's treating you, all of us. And the next thing I know he's launched himself at me. Are you getting on?
What?
Where does Dickie live?
We passed it a few blocks back, where the police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not going to incriminate Dickie --
Perhaps I shouldn't go either.
Hello Peter, so good to see you.
Hello Marge!
I was looking forward to seeing him.
Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
That's a terrific idea.
Look at me what?
Very.
Did Dickie's Dad go?
He's having an early night.
Tom?
Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
I found Dickie's rings.
What?
You've got Dickie's rings.
Dickie promised me he would never take off this ring.
Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this.
I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.
Marge, calm down, you're being hysterical.
He promised me. I swear I'll never take off this ring until the day --
Marge? Where are you going?
I was looking for a needle and thread. I wasn't snooping. I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra.
Today, for the first time, I've even wondered whether he might have killed Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody contradicted him -- well, you know that. Marge. I loved you -- you might as well know -- I loved you, and because he knew I loved you, he let you think I loved him. Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't
I told you. He gave them to me.
Why? When?
I feel as if you haven't heard anything I've been saying to you.
I don't believe you.
It's all true.
But I hope that note goes to New York in your purse, for a rainy day.
What are you going to do now, Tom?
I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --
Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day?
What?
I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.
Dickie? Do you know Dickie?
You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.
I told you! I knew it!
Marge, I don't know you, so I have no right, but Dickie loves you. He's -- I think you'll find he's coming home to you.
How would you know that?
Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard about you, of course -- from Marge, and Dickie.
Look there's Meredith thingy -- who's that, Marge? -- They're in textiles... Meredith -- God, how awful, I've spent Christmas in her house...!
No, we're meeting another friend. Tom Ripley.
We think he's had a change of heart. So we should be celebrating.
I hope so.
So you found Peter...
Where's Dickie's father?
Is this you?
No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?
This is spectacular.
That's why Tom wanted you to stay. It's better than squeezing into my room, and I know how you hate hotels.
What's funny?
What's your secret?
Excuse me?
I'm Meredith, by the way. Meredith Randall.
Dickie, Dickie Greenleaf. Hello.
You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?
Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.
So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? It's just -- upstairs -- weren't you under the R stand? I thought I saw you there.
My father wants me in New York. He builds boats. I'd rather sail them. I travel under my mother's name.
Which is?
Emily. Just kidding.
The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue.
As in the...?
As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug off the dress. I travel under my mother's name, too.
Randall.
But you're going skiing with us Yankees, aren't you?
What?
At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and --
How did you know that?
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
Is Freddie in Rome?
Now? I don't think so. But I've met him, of course, and we've chatted and I know about you and Marge and Mongi and what an unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you were a rat and I thought to myself now I know why he travels under R.
I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So the rat's here now, in Rome.
Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if --
The truth is if you've had money your entire life, even if you despise it, which we do -- agreed? -- you're only truly comfortable around other people who have it and despise it.
I know.
Show me the other one again. I like them both.
Let's go.
I thought you were enjoying yourself?
Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.
C'mon, I need to talk to you. Just the two of us.
Don't worry. Really. Don't worry.
You're such a pal to understand. It's as if Marge is here now -- I look at you and I see her face -- and I can't, whatever I'm feeling towards you -- I just can't...
No, I absolutely understand. Of course.
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
Will you meet me tomorrow? Just to say goodbye in the daylight, properly? So it's not just this, it's too... you should always save pain for daylight...
Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll meet you. Let's have coffee in the morning at Dinelli's.
I don't -- is that by the Spanish Steps?
Dickie, my God!
Hello Meredith.
I was looking at you, your clothes, I wouldn't have known you...
Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward.
What?
Just kidding. Are you alone?
Of course. Aunt Joan.
And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've thought about you so much.
When I thought about you I was mostly hating you. Where've you been hiding?
I haven't been hiding. I've been in Police custody. They've been trying to flush out Freddie's killer.
You're kidding.
They're letting me have this vacation. Which is why the get-up. Which is why you haven't heard from me.
You know, the whole world thinks you killed Freddie? It's terrible.
So -- are you travelling under R?
You know what -- I am.
Dickie, are you with Peter Smith- Kingsley? I bet you are. My aunt thought she saw him.
Ho assunto io la guida delle indagini in seguito alla negativa valutazione delle disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con il mio predecessore Roverini che come e noto non e riuscito a impedire il verificarsi della scomparsa del signor Greenleaf, il quale era l'unica persona al momento passibile di incriminazione del reato di omicidio del signor Miles.
He's taken over the case because... they're annoyed the previous chap let Dickie... disappear when he was the only, he was the only suspect in Freddie's murder.
Dove e stato il signor Ripley da allora?
All'aperto? Col freddo che ha fatto?
He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside.
Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali?
Non e questo il luogo per le vostre conversazioni private!
A ragione. A ragione.
Questa lettera e stata trovata nell'abitazione del signor Richard Greenleaf a Roma.
Ditto.
Yes, what happened? I heard you were desperate to come. I was looking forward to rowing you around.
I am. I really am. And I've been travelling. I just can't seem to get that far north.
Well hurry, before we sink. Should I give you my telephone number in Venice?
Will we see you later?
I can't later.
And tomorrow?
Tomorrow's possible. Do you know Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna?
I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?
Ten thirty?
We'll be there.
Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers. Italian bureaucracy -- never one stamp when they can make you line up for three. Have you been waiting long?
Not at all. Morning Tom.
My God.
But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
Peter, I'm really sorry to put you through this. I just couldn't face going to the police by myself when my Italian's so rotten.
Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted you finally made it to Venice. I'm delighted, contrary to rumour, you're still in one piece?
What rumour?
Welcome to Venice. This place reeks, doesn't it? Can you smell it? Ugh. Sorry. Not the best way to spend your first day.
It's okay.
Anyway I've got to the bottom of the delay. Finally. We're waiting for someone from Rome.
What do you mean? They're sending someone from Rome?
That's good, isn't it?
No, but I thought that didn't happen in Italy, that each region was completely separate! I was sure that was the --
You've seen the papers, you know what a big deal it's been here. American tourist murdered --
In Rome, about three weeks ago. I knew that one.
I've been backpacking.
No.
No. By the way, officially there are no Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo, Michelangelo very inconvenient.
Tell him I have a fiancée, Dickie has a fiancée and Freddie Miles probably had a string of them.
What did he say?
He wants to know if you killed Freddie Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf?
No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me? Ask him if he's accusing me!
He's already angry, I don't think --
Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill Freddie, what must that be like? To wake up every morning, how can you? Just wake up and be a person, drink a coffee...?
Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful -- it all makes sense, doesn't it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel.
But you're still tormented, you must be, you've killed somebody...
Don't you put the past in a room, in the cellar, and lock the door and just never go in there? Because that's what I do.
Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building.
I keep wanting to do that -- fling open the door -- let the light in, clean everything out. If I could get a huge eraser and rub everything out... starting with myself... the thing is, Peter, if...
I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have fallen asleep.
Not guilty.
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
Do you want me to stick around?
It's okay.
Tom, are you okay?
You try. You try talking to her.
Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?
Ask me what I want to change about this moment.
What do you want to change about this moment?
Hello. What are you up to?
All kinds of things. Making plans.
Plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?
I don't know. Both. My plan right now is to go up on deck, look at the sunset. Come with me.
You go. I don't want to get dressed yet. Come back though. Come back. You know, you look so relaxed, like a completely different person.
How was it?
Good. But I think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip.
Was that Meredith?
Was who Meredith?
Meredith Logue. You were kissing somebody. Looked like Meredith.
Hardly kissing. Kissing off.
Didn't look that way -- you know -- from a distance.
I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen you.
Why lie?
Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it?
Or Tom and Peter even.
Well that would be even better gossip.
Really, why? Sorry, I'm completely lost.
I know. I'm lost, too. I'm going to be stuck in the basement, aren't I, that's my, that's my -- terrible and alone and dark -- and I've lied about who I am, and where I am, and so nobody can ever find me.
What do you mean lied about who you are?
I suppose I always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.
What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.
Peter, I... I...
And don't forget. I have the key.
Good things about Tom Ripley? Could take some time!... Tom is talented. Tom is tender... Tom is beautiful...
You're such a liar...
Dickie Greenleaf?
Yes?
It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did Signor Miles leave yesterday?
I can't be absolutely sure -- 8? 9? We'd both taken on far too many drinks -- but it was dark, it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car.
So Signor Miles drove away and you did what?
Senta. We have to ask you to stay in Rome.
Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.
So, the Doctor, he has to make the -- -- come se dice?
Postmortem?
Yes, exactly, but his first, his first conclusion was that Signor Miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening.
Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he drove off in his car.
Can we go up? Do you mind?
Of course. What happened to your face?
The telephone, the press, I've been, I'm feeling hounded -- do you think you could not give out my address?
Never. We've had many requests and, of course, we say no -- even to your fiancée.
I really don't want to see anybody.
Even your fiancée...?
Even her.
What about Thomas Ripley?
Yes, sure, we did go to San Remo. That was months ago.
November, I thought.
Was it? Did you speak to Tom?
November 7th is my information.
I don't remember the exact date.
And when did you last see Signor Ripley?
A few days ago.
Does he stay with you here?
No!
No. Here is a pattern. Two days ago Freddie Miles is dead -- he leaves your apartment and is murdered. Yesterday a little boat is found in San Remo full of rocks, and the owner tells the Police it was stolen on November 7th. We look at hotel records and we see oh! Dickie Greenleaf is staying in San Remo and then our boatman
It's not a pattern, it's a coincidence. There must be fifty hotels in San Remo, there must have been a hundred people renting a boat on that day.
31 people.
That is Miss Sherwood now. Marge Sherwood.
Thank you.
May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiancée?
I think I just said. Ripley was handling some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley want to marry me. Nor did he ask me every day if I would marry him. And when.
Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley?
I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.
Now I think I have upset you. My English perhaps is coarse.
It is a little coarse, yes.
Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San --
I have!
You have, yes.
No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask her! And if I could remember which hotel he was staying at -- the Goldoni! -- Tom was staying at the Goldoni.
Good. The Goldoni. Yes -- you're right. A coincidence. I look forward to our next meeting when I will be more careful with my English and persuade you to play me your saxophone. Alto.
Absolutely.
I have a witness who thinks they saw two men getting into Mr Miles' car. She wants to identify you in a -- confronto -- line-up. Tomorrow then?
You got a .44 Magnum?
That's an expensive gun.
Some of these guns are like toys, but a Smith and Wesson, man, you can hit somebody over the head with it and it will still come back dead on. Nothing beats quality. You interested in an automatic?
I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.
How much for everything.
The .32's $150 -- and you're really getting a good deal now -- and all together it comes to, ah, seven eighty- five for four pieces and a holster. Hell, I'll give you the holster, we'll make it seventy-five and you've got a deal -- a good one.
How much to get a permit to carry?
Well, you're talking big money now. I'd say at least five grand, maybe more, and it would take a while to check it out. The way things are going now $5.000 is probably low. You see, I try not to fool with the small-time crap. Too risky, too little bread. Say 6 G's, but if I get the permit it'll be as solid as
Nah, this'll be fine.
You can't carry in a cab even with a permit -- so why bother?
Is there a firing range around?
You in Nam? Can't help but notice your jacket?
Huh?
Yeah. I was all around. One hospital, then the next.
It's hell out there all right. A real shit-eatin' war. I'll say this, though: It's bringing a lot of fantastic guns. The market's flooded. Colt automatics are all over.
You like ball games?
Huh?
I can get you front and center. What do you like? I can get you Mets, Knicks, Rangers? Hell, I can get you the Mayor's box.
Is that so? But what do you think of Charles Palantine?
Who mam?
Charles Palantine. The man you want to volunteer to help elect president.
Oh, I think he's a wonderful man. Make a great, great President.
You want to canvass?
Well, that's not exactly what the Senator has proposed. You might not want to canvass, but there is plenty more other work we need done: Office work, filing, poster hanging.
I'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a real good worker.
If you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something.
If you don't mind, mam, I'd rather work for you.
Well, we're all working tonight.
Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at night.
Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do?
Why?
I don't know...
It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.
All right. All right. I'm taking a break at four o'clock. If you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie.
Oh, I appreciate that, Betsy mam. I'll be here at four o'clock exactly. And... ah... Betsy...
Yes?
My name is Travis.
We've signed up 15,000 Palantine volunteers in New York so far. The organizational problems are becoming just staggering.
Travis, I never ever met anybody like you before.
I can believe that.
Where do you live?
Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much.
So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
I had a regular job for a while, days. You know, doin' this, doin' that. But I didn't have anything to do at night. I got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around. So I decided to works nights. It ain't good to be alone, you know.
After this job, I'm looking forward to being alone for a while.
Yeah, well... In a cab you get to meet people. You meet lotsa people. It's good for you.
What kind of people?
Just people people, you know. Just people. Had a dead man once.
Really?
He'd been shot. I didn't know that. He just crawled into the back seat, said "West 45th Street" and conked out.
What did you do?
I shut the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't going to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him.
That's really something.
Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moon's out.
The moon?
Com'on, Travis. It's not that bad. I take lots of taxis.
I know. I could have picked you up.
Huh?
Late one night. About three. At the plaza.
Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
You're right! Now I remember! It was after the Western regional planners were in town and the meeting went late. The next day I was completely bushed. It was unbelievable.
If it wasn't for a drunk I would have picked you up. He wanted to go to the DMZ.
The DMZ?
South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up.
That would have been quite a coincidence.
You'd be surprised how often you see the same people, get the same fare. People have patterns. They do more or less the same things every day. I can tell.
Well, I don't go to the Plaza every night.
I didn't mean you. But just ordinary people. A guy I know -- Dough-Boy -- met his wife that way. They got to talking. She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up.
That's very romantic. Some of your fares must be interesting. See any stars, politicians, deliver any babies yet?
Well, no... not really... had some famous people in the cab. I got this guy who makes lasers. Not regular lasers, not the big kind. Little lasers, pocket sized, small enough to clip your belt like a transistor radio, like a gun, you know. Like a ray gun. Zap.
What hours do you work?
I work a single, which means there's no replacement -- no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours a week.
You mean you work seventy-two hours a week.
Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I squeeze a few more hours in the morning. Eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a night.
You must be rich.
It keeps ya busy.
You know what you remind me of?
What?
That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction".
I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
Oh. Who was that again?
The singer?
Yeah. Yes. I don't follow music too much.
You didn't have to spend your money -- ?
Travis, you haven't even played the record?
Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.
Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music.
I don't follow music much. I'd like to though. Honest.
So you haven't heard this record yet?
What are you doing?
I bought a couple of tickets.
But this is a porno movie.
Damn.
What's wrong?
Where are you going?
I'm leaving.
These are not the kind of movies I go to.
Well, I don't follow movies too much...
This is sort of high class...
I mean porno movies.
Well... mostly...
My God!
...there's plenty of movies around here. I haven't seen any of them, but I'm sure they're good.
No, Travis. You're a sweet guy and all that, but I think this is it. I'm going home.
You mean you don't want to go to a movie? There's plenty of movies around here.
No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all.
Huh?
It's very simple. You go your way, I'll go mine. Thanks anyway, Travis.
But... Betsy...
What about the record?
Keep it.
Hello, Travis.
I see where Palantine got the nomination.
Yes. It won't be long now. Seventeen days.
How are you, Travis? I read about you in the papers.
No, no, please. This fare's on me. Please.
Travis?
Yeah.
Maybe I'll see you again sometime, huh?
Tom, come here a moment. I think this canvas report is about ready to go out. Check it out with Andy, and if he okays if, have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county. And don't forget to add the new photo releases.
The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?
Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway.
I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues.
First push the man, then the issue. Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man.
You forgot "sexy".
No, I didn't forget "sexy".
Just didn't get around to it, huh?
Oh, Tom, please.
Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you're selling... I don't know what... cars... not issues.
Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?
More people watch it.
Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,
No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just...
Just what?
Maybe if you'd try thinking once in a while, you'd get somewhere.
With who?
Well, if Cronkite's so great, why don't we run him instead?
That's the last. The finish. Period. Some people can learn. Some people can't. And you wonder why we never get serious --
Sure we could run him. You realize he's already head of his block association.
Have you been noticing anything strange?
No, why?
Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us?
What taxi driver?
That taxi driver. The one that's been sitting here.
How long has he been there?
Try holding the match like this.
This is gotta be a game, right?
This I gotta see.
Ouch!
Oh, are you all right?
I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose.
No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can.
Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand, Mr. Asbestos...
He happens to be missing fingers. I first noticed when --
Is he Italian?
No, why?
You sure he's not Italian?
He's Black, OK?
Well, If he had been Italian, they could have been shot off. Sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, If they blow a job or something.
As I said, he isn't Italian. Besides, I thought they just killed them.
Don't be naive. They can't kill everybody. They have different punishments for different things. Like, if they kill a stool pigeon, they leave a canary on the body. It's symbolic.
Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?
I don't know. Maybe they don't leave a canary. Don't be technical. What I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief.
First, he's not Italian. Second he's not a thief. I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change -- the right change. Two of his fingers are missing. Just stubs. Like they were blown away. I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette. I couldn't help watching. I was dying to see how he'd light
With the other hand, right?
No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.
I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand at --
No, this is young -- well, I'm never sure how old Black people are -- but, anyway, he isn't old. That's for sure.
Betsy, come over here a moment.
What is it? I'm busy.
No, I don't think so. That's someone else.
What is your name? My name is Travis.
Awh, come off it, Pal.
No, I'm serious, really...
Ya want me to call da boss? Huh? That what you want?
No, no, it's alright. I'll have a big Coca-Cola -- without ice -- and a large buttered popcorn, and... ...some of them chocolate covered malted milk balls... and ju-jukes, a box. They last.
We don't have ju-jukes. We don't have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal Crown Cola.
That's fine.
First she did her make-up. You know, I hate it when they do that. I mean she does the whole works, the mascara, the eye-shadow, the lipstick, the rouge...
Not rouge. Blush-On, they call it.
Yeah, that's Blush-On. My wife uses it,
Well, whatever the fuck it is, she used it. And then the spray perfume. You know, the real sweat kind -- and, on top of that, get this, right when we're crossing the Tri-boro bridge -- she changes her pantyhose!
Yeah.
Could you see anything?
Well, she was trying to keep her skirt down, sort of, you know. But it was pretty obvious what she was doing. I mean, Christ, it was rush hour and the traffic's practically standing still.
What did you do?
Threw on the emergency, jumped the seat and fucked her brains out -- What do you think! What do I have to do? Draw you a picture?
Yeah.
Sure. What do you think? She wanted to get out of the cab. I said "Look, you're in the middle of the fucking bridge..."
You said that?
Well, I said, "Lady, please, we're on a bridge..."
She stayed in the cab, what's she gonna do? But she stiffed me. A real skunk.
Yeah. We went to Harvard together.
We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
You run all over town, don't you, Travis?
Well, you ever need one, I know a feller that kin getcha a real nice deal. Lotsa shit around.
Truck drivers bring up Harlem Specials that blow up in your hand. But this guy don't deal no shit. Just quality. If you ever need anything, I can put you in touch.
For a fee.
For a fee.
I never use mine. But it's a good thing to have. Just as a threat.
Well, if there's this many hackies inside, there must be lots of fares outside. And I'm gonna hustle 'em.
What ya gonna do with all that money, Dough-Boy?
...he called up the Dispatcher last night. Charlie McCall, our dispatcher...
One-Ball McCall?
Fuckin' One-Ball.
Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
Stick up?
No, just some crazy fucker. Cut half his ear off.
Where.
Huh?
I mean, you handle some pretty rough traffic, huh?
I have.
You carry a piece? You need one?
20 bucks?
Hello.
You looking for some action?
Well... I guess so.
Why you hang around with them greasers?
A girl needs protection.
Yeah. From the likes of them.
What's your name?
Easy.
That ain't much of a name.
It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
What's your real name?
I don't like my real name.
What's your real name?
Iris.
That's a nice name.
Why? Who are you?
I drive a taxi. You tried to get away one night. Remember?
No.
You tried to run away in my taxi but your friend -- Sport -- wouldn't let you.
I don't remember.
It don't matter. I'm gonna get you outta here.
We better make it, or Sport'll get mad. How do you want to make it?
I don't want to make it. I came here to get you out.
Can't you listen to me? Don't you want to get out of here?
Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
But you're the one that wanted to get away. You're the one that came into my cab.
I musta been stoned.
Do they drug you?
Listen...
Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it!
You can do it in my mouth.
Do you understand why I came here?
I think so. I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away.
Don't you want to go?
I can leave anytime I want.
But that one night?
Well, I tried.
I understand, mister. It means something, really.
Can I see you again?
That's not hard to do.
No, I mean really. This is nothing for a person to do.
Sure. All right. We'll have breakfast. I get up about one o'clock. Tomorrow.
Well, you want to or not?
...and after that Sport and I just started hanging out...
Where?
Pittsburgh.
I ain't ever been there, but it don't seem like such a bad place.
Why do you want me to go back to my parents? They hate me. Why do you think I split? There ain't nothin there.
But you can't live like this. It's hell. Girls should live at home.
God, you are square.
Who's a killer?
That fella "Sport" looks like a killer to me.
He never killed nobody. He's a Libra.
Huh?
I'm a Libra too. That's why we get along so well.
He looks like a killer.
I think Cancer's make the best lovers. My whole family are air signs.
He shoots dope too.
What makes you so high and mighty? Did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror. You don't get eyes like that from...
Rock music died in 1970, that's what I think. Before that it was fantastic. I can tell you that. Everybody was crashing, hanging out at the Fillmore. Me and my girlfriend Ann used to go up the fire escape, you know? It was unbelievable. Rock Stars everywhere. That Airplane -- that's my group, man. All Libras. But now everybody's split or got sick or
I never been to a commune. I don't know. I saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me.
Why don't you come to a commune with me?
Me? I could never go to a place like that.
Why not?
I... I don't get along with people like that.
You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell.
Besides, I've got to stay here.
Why?
I've got something important to do. I can't leave.
What's so important?
I can't say -- it's top secret. I'm doing something for the Army. The cab thing is just part time.
You a narc?
Do I look like a narc?
God, I don't know who's weirder, you or me.
What are you going to do about Sport and that old bastard?
Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls.
You just gonna leave 'em?
What should I do? Call the cops?
Cops don't do nothin.
Sport never treated me bad, honest. Never beat me up once.
You can't leave 'em to do the same to other girls. You should get rid of them.
How?
I don't know. Just should, though. Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
You're not much with girls, are you?
Do you really think I should go to the commune?
Sure you don't want to come with me?
I can't. Otherwise, I would.
I sure hate to go alone...
I'll give you the money to go. I don't want you to take any from those guys.
You don't have to.
I want to -- what else can I do with my money? You may not see me again -- for a while.
What do you mean?
Why should it be grounded?
Listen -- I mean I just saw the needle of the Empire State Building. You can't see it for the fog!
Then it's a good guess it's grounded.
The Empire State in fog means something, don't it? Do you know, or don't you? What is your number, cabbie?
Have you tried the telephone?
There isn't time for that. In other words, you don't know.
No.
Say, aren't you Charles Palantine, the candidate?
Yes I am.
Well, I'm one of your biggest supporters. I tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you.
Why, thank you Travis.
I'm sure you'll win, sir. Everybody I know is going to vote for you. I was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy.
Travis, what single thing would you want the next President of this country to do most?
I don't know, sir. I don't follow political issues much.
There must be something...
I know what you mean, Travis, and it's not going to be easy. We're going to have to make some radical changes.
Nice talking to you, Travis.
No trouble with the Hack Bureau?
No Sir.
Got your license?
Yes.
So why do you want to be a taxi driver?
I can't sleep nights.
There's porno theatres for that.
So whatja do now?
I ride around nights mostly. Subways, buses. See things. Figur'd I might as well get paid for it.
You kiddin? Who else would hack through South Bronx or Harlem at night?
You want to work uptown nights?
I'll work anywhere, anytime. I know I can't be choosy.
How's your driving record?
Clean. Real clean. As clean as my conscience.
Listen, son, you gonna get smart, you can leave right now.
Sorry, sir. I didn't mean that.
Physical? Criminal?
Also clean.
Age?
Twenty-six.
Education?
Some. Here and there.
Military record?
Honorable discharge. May 1971.
You moonlightin?
No, I want long shifts.
We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
So I hear.
Hell, we ain't that much fussy anyway. There's always opening on one fleet or another. Fill out these forms and give them to the girl at the desk, and leave your phone number. You gotta phone?
No.
Well then check back tomorrow.
Are you a Secret Service Man?
Why do you ask?
Who?
Is it hard to get to be a Secret Service Man?
Why?
I kinda thought I might make a good one. I'm very observant.
Oh?
Is that so?
Look, um, if you give me your name and address, we'll send you the information on how to apply.
You would, huh?
Sure.
My name is Henry Krinkle -- that's with a "K." K-R-I-N-K-L-E. I live at 13 1/2 Hopper Avenue, Fair Lawn, New Jersey. Zip code 07410. Got that?
Sure, Henry. I got it all. We'll send you all the stuff all right.
Here, officer, take me in. I'm clean. I didn't do it. Got a ticket once in Jersey. That's all. Honest, officer.
Your name Sport?
Anything you say, officer.
I'm no cop. I want some action.
I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30 half hour.
Shit.
I'm no cop.
Well, if you are, it's entrapment already.
I'm hip.
Hey, Sport. How are things?
O.K., cowboy.
How are things in the pimp business, hey Sport?
What's going on?
I'm here to see Iris.
Wha -- ?
Yeah, Iris. You know anybody by that name?
Get it.
Hey, mister, I don't know what's going on here. This don't make any sense.
Travis.
So howsit?
What's the action around?
Wiz?
Yeah?
Look, ah, we never talked much, you and me...
Yeah?
I wanted to ask you something, on account you've been around so long.
Shoot. They don't call me the Wizard for nothing.
Well, I just, you know...
Things got ya down?
Real down.
It happens.
Sometimes it gets so I just don't know what I'm gonna do. I get some real crazy ideas, you know? Just go out and do somethin.
The taxi life, you mean.
Yeah.
I know.
Like do anything, you know.
Look, a person does a certain thing and that's all there is to it. It becomes what he is. Why fight it? What do you know? How long you been a hack, a couple months? You're like a peg and you get dropped into a slot and you got to squirm and wiggle around a while until you fit in.
That's just about the dumbest thing I ever heard, Wizard.
What do you expect, Bertrand Russell? I've been a cabbie all my life, what do I know? I don't even know what you're talking about.
Neither do I, I guess.
You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.
Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
Don't worry, Killer. You'll be all right. I seen enough to know.
Had a close one.
Not really.
Could we change the subject?
That record company.in Nashville wants to hear my demo tape.
Hey! Now there's some good news.
You think I'm too... ethnic for country music?
Stick with Carla.
Don't stop... do no stop.
No.
Maybe. Not really.
Thank you.
You're not wimping out on us, Goodspeed.
Spit it out.
It's me sir.
He says he's leaving the island sir.
He's got a gun, sir.
Just come and get me, sir. I'm tired.
What do you do for the F.B.I., Goodspeed.
I'm a field agent.
I don't understand....
During the time I cooperate, will I be outside? Outside a jail?
Well yes I suppose ...
You suppose?
John Mason. ' Don't be shocked. I don't have much time. Please listen carefully ....
Motor oil?
Don't shoot me. Mason was actually slinging it over his shoulder...
For christ's sake. Mason trudges down the tu=3Del. Goodspeed follows him.
I.don't get it. You're going to help me?
Limp dick?
I'll go.
Wrong.
What, vou?
What are you doing?
Wait.
Mason. Mason?
You referring to your intellect, Goodspeed? Or another portion of your= anatomy ....
Surprise, surprise.
I'm not a field agent, all right? So cut me a break.
Partners?
Mason, uhm, John, I have something to tell you. You know that pardon= contract you signed?
Womack ripped it up, right?
You knew? All this time?
I'm not a fool, Billy.
God's speed.
St. Michael's Church, Fort Walton, Kansas. Front pew. Right leg. = Hollow.
Hi.
I'm sure a lot of people down in L.A. are worried sick about you.
This Luke was a pretty good guy, wasn't he?
Oh, yes. Yes, he was.
Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke. I know who I am now, and you don't. And... I don't like me very much.
You know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you Pete. Pete. Pete. It's a nice name.
I believe you.
The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them.
But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?
Come on, Delly, look at the country today. We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb... You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"
What about you, Delly?
You'll stand by me?
You've got everything?
Yeah. Except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact.
You'll be fine. No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side. Don't forget that.
I wish you were coming with me.
And who's gonna run the projector until you get back? Mrs. Terwilliger?
Did you bring along something to read?
Not exactly light reading, I know. Believe it or not, I've read this since high school, and it got me all the way through law school. Besides, there's something in there that'll help you. You won't have to get very far, it's near the beginning.
Delly... thanks, thank you. I'll take good care of this.
Just remember two things. First, the law is a living thing. It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes. But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while.
Tell them Pete. Tell them...
I see you got the telegram.
Pete, I'm so sorry about what they did to you. I didn't think you'd come back, I thought you'd want to write again...
Dell, I can't write unless I'm happy, and I can't be happy unless I'm here -- and with you. This is me, Delly. Pete Appleton. And I love you!
Dad?
How'd it go?
Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed.
That's my girl! Did you...?
I think it's worse now.
That always used to work.
Yeah, well it's not everyday you get news like this. You're sure he's okay? Other than the bump on the head?
Well...
He doesn't remember anything, Delly. Doesn't know how he got here, doesn't remember his father, the town, the Bijou, anyone...
... including me. Right?
I'm afraid not. He looked right at your picture without batting an eye. But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him. It just takes a catalyst.
You mean, me?
Daddy, that's Luke, can you let him in? I'll be right down.
Besides, Daddy's still trying to figure out how to get his new television set working.
Do you... remember me?
What.
No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time.
Me too.
You look... different.
I do?
Yeah, a little. I think you grew an inch or so. And you've lost weight.
You can all go home, now. He's not going anywhere.
Then why do I feel like we're still being shadowed?
City hall?
You first.
Why me?
Of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here.
How'd they get it inside?
Right here. "Albert Lucas Trumbo." And all the others. I knew them all. So did you. We went to school with most of them.
It doesn't seem right, this being down here. It ought to be where people can see it.
So, you're really gonna be a lawyer?
And why not?
Whoa.
Sorry. You don't know how many times I've heard that. "A lady lawyer? Are you crazy?" Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man. Or better, in fact.
Have you always wanted to be a lawyer?
You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.
What did... what did I want to be?
You don't have a boyfriend or anyone... you know... like that?
Actually, I was married. For four years. But... well, we didn't fit together. I'm divorced now.
I'm sorry.
No, it's okay. See, when two people belong together, the other person should be the... the key that unlocks the rest of you... I'm not making sense, am I?
No, you are. I know exactly what you mean. It's not that you're missing something. It's that the other person gives something to you... that you had all the time. You just didn't see it until they came along.
We were in love... weren't we?
What was that?
Nothing.
Do you have the...
Were we going to get married?
No... you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before...
Oh...
This is strange. Do you feel it?
What?
We've done this before, so many times. The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.
You know, everyone's so excited about the Bijou re-opening...
It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly.
Nine hundred...
Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around.
What about a loan? You could go to the bank...?
A loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life? Not likely.
Well, there's got to be a way...
When did you start smoking?
I don't smoke?
You tried to once. It was pretty pitiful.
They're not bad.
No, they're not. I'd say your investment was paying dividends.
My what?
Back in '37, you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet. You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him. You tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking over his shoulder. So you gave the clarinet to Spencer.
Huh. That was nice of me.
You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy. Bothered the hell out of you. But as soon as you gave him the clarinet...
... he started practicing, and he left me alone from then on.
Exactly. And he got good.
Now, did you remember that, or...
Nope. Just filling in the blanks.
How do you tell those two apart, anyway?
Alex and Charlie? Simple. Alex is the smarter one.
Your dancing's very good.
Thanks.
It never used to be. You were two left feet on the dance floor. Like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step.
What... do you remember?
Well... everything. It started coming back a couple of days ago. I remember everything now.
I see...
Delly, shhhhhh...
Sir, that is true.
Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
Luke Trumbo? We never met. But I'd like to think I know him.
Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson?
Mr. Clyde you're twisting things around. I wasn't masquerading. Luke Trumbo... Luke was a good man who gave his life for his country. I just... happen to look a little bit like him. That's all.
Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead. I also see that you were posted stateside during the war. Fort Dix?
Yes, sir.
Now, I see that you've been running a movie theater in Lawson called "The Bijou," is that also true?
Anyone who reads the newspaper is quite familiar with your... "accident," Mr. Appleton. An accident which, conveniently, came hard upon your dismissal from United Pictures. Tell us, this "accident" of yours, are we given to understand that it affected your memory?
Yes.
Sir, are you referring to the fact that I was suffering from amnesia, and I've since recovered my memory?
I'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past, or if they've been conveniently "blotted out" as a result of your "accident."
Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.
Yes... yes, I do.
Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?
Yes it does.
Mr. Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club?"
Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what I knew then, or do you want to know what I know now? They're two different things?
Start with what you knew then.
Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there.
We see it. For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom." What's the point of this?
Well, that's what I knew then. Or who I knew, I should say. You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom. I went to the meeting to impress her.
Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl?
All right, Mr. Appleton. That was what you knew then. What do you know now?
Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college. I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for?
Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the communist party?
No, sir.
Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
I'm not refuting anything.
Yet you're contradicting yourself. You earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party-run organization, yet you just said, under oath, that you were not now -- nor ever -- a member of the communist party.
That's not a contradiction at all, sir. I went to the meeting, but I didn't go as a member.
Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
I do.
Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
Peter Kenneth Appleton. Hollywood, California.
The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton. We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee?
I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.
Now, we're informed that you have a statement you'd like to read, is that correct?
Yes. A prepared statement.
I'm a little hesitant to say.
Mr. Appleton, you are making light of a legally constituted committee of the United States Congress. Believe you me, you do not want to incur our wrath.
Mr. Appleton? Mr. Appleton?
I... I need a drink of water.
Mr. Chairman... there's... another Amendment... that I'd like to invoke at this time, but it's not the Fifth Amendment. I wonder if you're familiar with it.
Cecil! Cecil, there's a young man in there...
Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office?
Only one in town. Get in, son.
Here we are.
Thanks for the lift, Cecil.
No wallet, huh?
No identification at all. What're you thinkin', Cecil?
Doc, with your permission, I want to bring someone in here. Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory.
Are you saying that he's...
Mother o'god...
Tomorrow afternoon... ... oh my god...
Yes.
You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge?
No. But...
But what?
Well, this place sorta reminds me of something.
What's that?
"It's a Wonderful Life."
The Jimmy Stewart picture? I remember that one. Saw it over at the Bijou. So, you remember that, huh?
"It's a Wonderful Life?"
Or the Bijou. Either one.
C'mon, I'll give you two a lift back to the Bijou.
Well, no, but these gentlemen would like to get some answers...
Luke, you probably don't remember me, Roscoe Fitts, I'm the grocer here in town.
Good to meet you. Again.
Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back.
Thanks.
And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.
We're gonna try. Place needs a lot of work.
I can only imagine. You know, I spoke with your Dad last year about maybe taking the Bijou off his hands. I don't think he gave it very much thought.
Well, he loves the place. It's his home.
Luke, I'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation. I'll come to the point. I want to buy the property, and I'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars for it. And that's just for the property, mind you. If you want, I'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has,
That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...?
The days of the storefront grocery are numbered. I plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket.
A super market. Huh.
So... you do intend to fix the place up after all?
Excuse me... what's your, um, your name?
Harry, son. Harry.
And... what's my name again?
Albert Lucas Trumbo. But you've been "Luke" since you were a baby.
You never came back from the war. We were told you were missing and presumed dead.
When did I leave?
Nine and-a-half years ago.
Wait'll you see the inside!
We've been closed for a while.
Exactly how long has the Bijou been closed?
Hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then Lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight.
Why?
Well, after the war, with so many of the town's boys killed, people around here didn't much feel like going to the movies, I guess. Some of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco. Wasn't much to keep 'em here, I expect. And now with this "television" thing -- people just aren't going out as much as they used to.
Didn't you have any help?
That's Lily. Your mother, rest her soul.
Mother. She's beautiful.
They couldn't wait to see you.
Who... are they?
This is the staff of the Bijou.
Oh. What... what time is it?
I promised him a new uniform when we re-opened. And you'll get one, too.
Um... Harry? Did I ever keep the books here?
No, your mother did, then I did after she passed.
"February 10, 1942. Picture 'Ball of Fire.'"
Gary Cooper. And Barbara Stanwyck. Yowsa.
Yes?
"one fryer and two-dozen eggs?"
Forty-two was a lean year around here. The war had just started... you were gone less than a month... and we were coming off a bit of a drought as I recall. Not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket, and a chicken's as good as money if you ask me. At that time, it meant a lot to the folks around
Yeah, I know, but poultry...?
But I...
Ernie.
Carl. Friend of yours from high school. Everybody calls him "Cueball."
I'll be home in a little while, Harry. Don't wait up.
You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
You bet.
Well...
Yes?
And you have sixty-eight dollars and thirty-seven cents in the bank. Your only source of income are my veteran's death benefit of forty dollars a month, to which you're no longer entitled since I'm alive, and these ten dollar a month cash deposits you make. What are those?
Why don't you two get out there and dance?
Beautiful, wasn't it?
Yes.
Well, son, I wish I could've shown you more, but this is all that's left. Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. Nineteen twenty-five, to be exact...
Dad, I...
Ha!
... what?
Luke... what time is it?
Jesus...
The film broke...
I'm here.
Did you... did you...
Did I what?
Did you fix the damn film? It broke in the last reel.
I know. Everyone went home. We offered them refunds.
Anybody take it?
A few.
I'm not happy about this, mind you, but if I have to go, at least I'm going in my own bed, the same bed my Lily died in, and... knowing that my son is alive. That's not too shabby, is it?
You're not going anywhere, Harry.
Pete. You think maybe you've had enough?
Thanks, Jerry. Tell me something.
What.
You tight with J. Edgar Hoover?
The G-man?
Zackly.
Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him.
Too bad. He says I'm a communist.
You should watch what you say. You don't know who's listening.
You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer?
Sure, I suppose. That why you're on a bender?
Pete... go home. Come on, I'll call that girlfriend of yours, what's her name... Sandy?
Sandra Sinclair.
Gimmee her number, I'll have her pick you up.
Sandra Sinclair. Wanna know her real name? Bella Iskowitz. No one's who they really are, Jer. Everyone's someone else. Even you. Even me. Especially me. I'm Peter Appleton, the communist who's not really a communist.
Nope. Can't. We're through.
Then I'll call you a cab.
'Sides, car's right outside. I'll be seein' ya, Jer.
Any idea how you got here, son?
Been drinkin' a bit, have we?
I don't remember. I guess so. Smells like it. Tastes like it.
Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.
I guess I did.
Here, one of mine.
Do you remember if you were driving a car? Maybe you went over the bridge. No guard rail there, it's easy to do. It's happened before.
It's possible. I just don't remember.
And you don't know your name or who you are, that right?
I... no, I... I just can't...
What is it?
Call me... Ishmael?
That's me and my daughter Adele. My pride and joy. Charms the fish right out of the lake, she does.
She's very pretty.
... sorry 'bout that, but you do look familiar to me.
That's where you live.
Evening, Luke.
What's wrong?
Uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it...
You kids off to the dance?
Aren't you coming?
It's a pretty massive heart attack. His lungs have filled with fluid, and, well... it seems as though his body is just... shutting down.
Can we get him to the hospital?
You smell gas?
Don't smell nothin'. He must not be dead in here.
Jesus.
You think he's drunk somewhere?
Wouldn't blame him if he was.
Well, his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency. He lose his job or somethin'?
What's his rent?
Here's three months rent, and a ten spot for no more questions and to keep an eye on his place. Now, I need a moment alone.
Huh?
Take a hike. Am-scray.
Peter, their hands are tied. You see that, don't you?
I... I don't believe this.
Are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? They say you did.
Who the hell is this "they?"
Congress, the FBI, Red Channels, it don't matter who the hell "they" is. "They" know who "they" are, that's all that matters. Now, did you go to any meetings?
No. Yeah... I... I don't know. Maybe I did. Leo, this was before Pearl Harbor. I was in college. It was a bunch of kids, and I was just one of 'em. I didn't believe in what they were saying. Hell, I didn't even know what they were saying!
So, you're saying that it's true. You went to a meeting of a known communist organization.
Leo, I was trying to impress a skirt. You know me, I'm non- political. Republican, Democrat, Communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway.
You should watch what you say.
I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist!
Kid, that cuts no ice with them.
What? That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one?
They know you were at that meeting, Peter. They've been told, and they know.
Leo, you're my agent. Tell "them" to take a flyin' piss. I didn't do anything wrong. I fought in the war, for crissakes!
Fought? Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix.
I was decorated.
I know. A Purple Heart.
Exactly.
You broke your arm. You were coming out of a bar. You were drunk.
At least I was on our side! Look, they want me to testify? I'll testify. I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear! Jesus, Leo, this is my career!
You can't testify.
They don't want you to testify because you're not a big enough fish for them. They just don't want you writing pictures for now. That's all.
Yeah, well, that's enough.
Peter, I believe in you. More to the point, I read your new script... um...
"Ashes To Ashes?"
That's the one, "Ashes To Ashes." I think it's great. But it'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head. You can't work until you're cleared -- and believe me, starting right now, I'm gonna do everything I can to make that happen.
So, it is a blacklist.
Don't say that. There is no such thing as a blacklist. Now, are you gonna play ball?
The FBI can't arrest you, because you haven't done anything wrong.
Well, that's a relief. I understand they usually don't let that stop them.
However... you're gonna be subpoenaed to testify before the Un-American Activities Committee when they open hearings in Los Angeles. Now, if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear, they'll clear you.
And I won't be a communist anymore.
Exactly.
Next time, it might be the FBI. The time after that, it might be the President. But it'll always be someone. Count on it.
That's not the country Luke fought for.
Lest we forget, Peter, your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than Luke's.
It's wrong, Leo.
That was quite a show you gave them today. We shoulda sold tickets.
I'm not sorry for what I said.
Cigarette?
When'd you quit smoking?
Luke didn't smoke.
Oh, I see. But you're not Luke. You're Peter Appleton, the picture writer.
Not any more.
Why not?
Leo, you were in there, you saw what I did. You think they're gonna let me write pictures? Hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail.
Not at all.
Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore.
Peter, I'm an agent. I buy lunches and get deals made for guys like you. That's what I do. You're a writer. You write pictures. That's what you do. And trust me, you'll be back doing it again tomorrow morning.
What do you mean?
Kid, you gave them what they wanted. This committee, it feeds on names. The more names, the better. But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do.
Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.
Her name was right there in front of them. They gave it to me, I didn't give it to them.
Well, that's not what they think.
Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...
You should keep track of your old school chums. Turns out she eventually joined the communist party. On top of which, she's Lucy Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for "Studio One" on CBS.
Oh god, oh, god, no, I...
So, our lawyers had a talk with the Committee's lawyers. That Elvin Clyde fella won't be too happy about it, but we cut a deal. They cleared you -- and they're gonna thank you publicly for your testimony purging yourself.
Thank me publicly? For what? For ruining this woman's life?
I haven't danced with another man since Mr. Terwilliger passed.
When was that?
That was beautiful.
I taught you that.
I can play the piano?
Sit. Play with me.
No, I...
Luke! Luke, something's wrong! The film broke, and I can't raise Harry on the house phone!
What?
Is there a young Tim?
No.
Found me.
So I guess this fellow belongs to you. What's his name?
Cat.
Cat. That's simple. I like it. Hi, Cat.
We thought you was dead, you know. It's okay that I live here?
T-t-thank you. Thank you. I... I always... I always wanted to wear my uniform from the Great War, but your daddy, he always said no, that's not an usher's u-u-uniform, that's an army uniform and the Bijou, she's not the army. They give me a medal, but I lost it in the h-h-hospital. I forget things sometimes. Since the w-w-war.
That's my r-r-rent.
Can I... Can I t-t-talk to you?
Please, sit.
They'll come back, you know. They'll all c-c-come back.
The customers? I don't know...
Tim, I have to tell you something.
Oh.
It's about me.
I'm... I'm not Luke. Luke is dead. He died in the war. He's not coming back, and I'm not him. I don't even belong here. This whole thing started out as an accident, and that's all it is. An accident.
Oh...
Did you think I didn't kn-kn-know that?
I thought you...
Pete, there's time before the picture starts, you want to get some popcorn?
What happened?
What exactly did you hear?
That you got let go.
I wasn't alone. Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in?
He was, but he got sick. We got a new director today. Why?
Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching.
You mean, he was... let go, too?
Will you help me, Sandy?
Ancestors?
I suppose. Thanks.
They all know you?
Ernie Cole here just got himself elected mayor. Lost both his boys in the war. Kenny at Anzio and Willie at Normandy.
The war...
You hungry, son?
Yes. Very.
Said as much myself, Doc. Can't place him, though. To look at him, you'd think the cheese slid off his cracker. Well, morning's half-over. I'm off.
Thank you, Mr. Lawson.
Now that you remember who you are, were you planning on telling anyone your true identity?
I already have.
Who?
My girlfriend. If she still is...
Would that be Miss Sinclair?
Mr. Appleton, I have reason to believe you're holding something back, and that just rubs me the wrong way. Sir, are you a communist?
No. Absolutely not.
Miss Hayworth?
Yes?
Yes?
The man at the post office sent me. He said you'd know the name of the little Brenner girl.
Cathy?
The one who lives in the white house across the bay?
That's the one. Cathy Brenner.
They seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.
Are you a friend of Mitch's?
I've been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes, but I couldn't convince myself to stop. This 'tilling of the soil' can get a little compulsive, you know.
It's a lovely garden.
Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time. There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay. Did you plan on staying long?
No. Just a few hours.
You're leaving after you see Cathy?
Well... something like that. I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so mysterious.
Did you drive up from San Francisco?
Yes.
It's a nice drive. Is that where you met Mitch?
Yes.
Do I? No, I'm an open book, I'm afraid. Or maybe a closed one. Pretty. What are they?
Mmm. Well, good luck, Miss Daniels.
Oh, hi! Did you find her all right?
I was wondering...
Yes?
That sign. Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
Well, I'd really hope to rent it for...
I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full.
It's utilitarian, I'll say that for it.
I just picked up some things for the night at the general store. You see, I hadn't planned on spending much time here.
Miss Daniels? Is that you?
Hi. Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you?
No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
Would you like some brandy?
If you have some, I'd...
No, thank you. Won't you call me Melanie?
Thank you.
Or would you rather I changed the subject?
I think so.
How do you like our little hamlet?
I despise it.
Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to.
Where are you from originally, Annie?
San Francisco.
How'd you happen to come here?
I guess you knew that, anyway.
I suspected as much.
You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me.
Isn't there? Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's never anything between Mitch and any girl.
What do you mean?
I think I'll have some of that, too. I was seeing quite a lot of him in San Francisco, you know. And then, one weekend, he asked me up to meet Lydia.
When was this?
Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died. Things may be different now.
Different?
With Lydia. Did she seem a trifle distant?
A trifle.
Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it.
When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
And what had you done?
Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother. Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
Then what was it?
Lydia liked me, you see. That was the strange part of it. In fact, now that I'm no longer a threat, we're very good friends.
Then why did she object to you?
Because she was afraid.
Afraid you'd take Mitch?
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
I don't understand.
Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love.
Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.
No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see. She's only afraid of being abandoned.
Someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter.
She already has a daughter.
What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this?
I can understand his position. He went through a lot with Lydia after his father died. He didn't want to risk going through it all over again.
I see.
So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.
Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?
You get straight to the point, don't you?
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself.
I did.
Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.' And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce
And the second?
He wants me to go to Cathy's party tomorrow afternoon. I said I would.
I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie.
Do you think I should go?
That's up to you.
It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
Yes.
Is anyone there?
Look.
He got a call from Dan Fawcett a little while ago. His chickens won't eat, either.
It's what you said, Mom. Mr. Brinkmeyer's feed is no good.
Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco. Of course, they're mostly hoods.
Cathy!
Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it. He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.
In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...
Yes, I did.
Mother!
Mitch, can I bring the lovebirds in here?
No!
Mom, they're in a cage!
They haven't harmed anyone.
Miss Daniels?
They're beautiful! They're just what I wanted! Is there a man and a woman? I can't tell which is which.
I still don't understand how you knew I wanted lovebirds.
Is smoking fun?
Oh, I suppose so.
Could I have a puff?
I don't think your mother would like that.
Why, it's just like air, isn't it? When I grow up, I'm gonna smoke like a chimney! I'll be eleven tomorrow, you know.
I know.
Are you coming to my party?
I don't think so. I have to get back to San Francisco.
Don't you like us?
Darling, of course I do!
Don't you like Bodega Bay?
I don't know yet.
Mitch likes it very much. He comes up every weekend, you know, even though he has his own apartment in the city. He says San Francisco is just an ant hill at the foot of a bridge.
I guess it does get a little hectic at times.
Why didn't Annie stay for dinner?
She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
We've got an extra room upstairs and everything.
Yeah, but she'll be hitting all that traffic going back to San Francisco.
Mitch? Why are they doing this? The birds.
I don't know, honey.
Why are they trying to kill people?
Cathy! Get a blanket and some bandages!
Mitch, let's turn back.
Mitch? Do... do you think they'll be all right? In the trunk? Can they breath?
What?
The little Brenner girl.
Lois!
It's Alice, ain't it?
No, it's Lois!
Good morning.
Morning.
I wonder if you could help me.
Try my best.
I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner.
Do you know him?
Yep.
Where does he live?
Right here. Bodega Bay.
Yes, but where?
Right across the bay there.
See where I'm pointing?
Yes?
See them two big trees across there?
Yes?
And the white house?
That's where the Brenners live.
The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.
The two kids?
Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
I see. How do I get down there?
Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
The front door. Isn't there a back road I can take?
Nope. That's the road. Straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door.
You see, I wanted to surprise them.
Mmmm.
I didn't want to come right down the road, where they could see me.
Mmmm.
It's a surprise, you see.
Mmmmmm. 'Course, you could get yourself a boat, cut right across the bay with it. The Brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at. If that's what you wanted to do.
Where would I get a boat?
Down at the dock by the Tides Restaurant. Ever handled an outboard boat?
Of course.
D'you want me to order one for you?
Thank you.
What name?
Daniels.
I wonder if you could tell me...
Yep?
The little girl's name.
The little Brenner girl?
Yes.
Are you sure?
Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.
I need her exact name, you see.
That case, I tell you what you do. You go straight through town 'til you see a little hotel on your left there. Not the motel, that's the other end of town. This is the hotel. Now you take a right turn there, you got that?
Yes?
Near the top of the hill, you'll see the school and right behind it, the church. You head for the school. Now just past the school, you'll see a little house with a red mail box. That's where Annie Hayworth lives, she's the school teacher. You ask her about the little Brenner girl.
Thank you.
Yep. Could save yourself a lot of trouble. Her name's Alice for sure.
How much for the phone calls?
I don't see what difference it makes, Mrs. Bundy, crows or blackbirds. If they attacked the school, that's pretty serious.
Mrs. Bundy, you don't seem to understand. This young lady says there was an attack on the school.
I didn't even know there were many crows in Bodega Bay this time of year.
Why not, Mrs. Bundy?
What good'll that do? Smoke's as bad as birds.
Deke, have you got a first aid kit back there?
What happened?
Young woman cut herself.
Shall I call the doctor?
You cut yourself outside, Miss?
I had a man trip and fall in the parking lot once, sued me before I could bat an eyelash.
I don't think Miss Daniels is going to sue anybody.
We don't have any fog this time of year, Mitch.
Gulls!
Are you finished here, Sebastian?
Let me have some apple pie, Helen. Who said anything about war? All I said was that some gulls...
One apple pie! You want more coffee?
Here's your pie, Sebastian. You want it at the table?
No. Here's fine.
I thought I saw your car. What are you doing in town?
I had to acknowledge a delivery. Mother, I'd like you to meet...
A what?
How do you do, Miss Daniels? Acknowledge a what?
Oh. I see.
For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she?
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
You did say birds?
Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
Lovebirds, I see.
Seven o'clock, same as usual.
There's nothing wrong with those chickens, Mitch. I'm going to call Fred Brinkmeyer right now.
He sold the feed to me, didn't he?
Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
Whose side are you on?
I'm simply quoting the law.
She's a charming girl, isn't she, Mitch?
Yes, very.
And certainly pretty.
Yes.
How long have you known her?
I told you. We met yesterday.
In a bird shop.
Yes.
She was selling birds.
No. I only led her into believing I believed she was... Mother, it's really very complicated.
But she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way...
Mother, where did you go to law school?
Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that. She's very rich, isn't she?
I suppose so. Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco.
You'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print. She's always mentioned in the columns, Mitch.
I know, Mother.
She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?
Yes, Mother.
Perhaps I'm old-fashioned. I know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but... well... actually... well, the newspaper said she was naked.
I know, Mother.
It's none of my business, of course, but when you bring a girl like that to...
Mother?
Yes?
I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
Well... So long as you know what you want, Mitch.
Well... well, is everyone all right?
Tell him about the party.
Did you you get the windows in the attic, Mitch?
I got them all, Mother.
When do you think they'll come?
I don't know.
If there are... larger birds, Mitch... they'll get into the house.
That's a chance we have to take.
Maybe we ought to leave.
Not now. Not while they're massing out there.
When?
I don't know when. We'll see what...
Where will we go?
I don't know yet. I think we'll be safe here. Let's bring that wood in.
I don't know. We'll break up the furni...
Mother! I'm trying my best! I'm... trying... my...
Mitch...
Mother, get a rope!
Oh, my God, look at her!
I can handle it.
I'm not very good at this, Mitch.
You're doing fine.
They're gone. The same pattern.
But they'll be back.
We won't be here.
Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go.
I want to try for San Francisco. There are buildings there. Steel and concrete!
We'd never make it. They're probably all over the road.
We have to try it. We can't stay here. Melanie needs help. Mother, the house won't take another attack.
If... If... when we get to San Francisco... If they're already there?
They won't be.
If they are?
We'll worry about that when we get there.
I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch.
What do we have to know, Mother? We're all together, we all love each other, we all need each other. What else is there? Mother, I want us to stay alive!
I started to say... inside...
Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco, is that right?
If I go across to Santa Rosa I'll come onto the freeway much earlier.
No, it's me, Mrs. Brenner. I thought you might like some tea.
Where's Mitch?
Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.
Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner.
Then he saw.
He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.
Do you think Cathy's all right?
What?
Yes, I'm sure she's fine.
Do I sound foolish to you?
No.
I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face. They have such big windows at the school. All the windows were broken. In Dan's bedroom. All the windows.
Try not to think of that, Mrs. Brenner.
I wish I were a stronger person. There is a long awkward silence. She sips at her tea reflectively.
I lost my husband four years ago, you know. It's odd how you depend on someone for strength, and then suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone. I'd love to relax some time. I'd love to be able to sleep. Do you think Cathy's all right?
Annie's there. She'll be all right.
I'm not this way, you know. Not usually. I don't fuss and fret over my children. When Frank died... You see, he knew the children, he really knew them. He had the knack of being able to enter into their world, of becoming a part of them. That's a rare talent.
Yes.
I miss him. You know, sometimes I wake up in the morning, and I think 'I have to make Frank's breakfast,' and I... I get up and there's a... a very good reason for getting out of bed until... until, of course, I remember. I miss talking to him. Cathy's a child, you know, and Mitch... ...Mitch has his own life. I'm glad he
Would you like to rest now, Mrs. Brenner.
No. No... don't go yet. I feel as if I... I don't understand you. And I want so much to understand.
Why, Mrs. Brenner?
Because my son is... My son seems to be fond of you. And I... I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. I really don't know if I... like you or not.
Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner? You liking me?
Yes, I think so. My son is important to me. I want to like any girl he chooses.
And if you don't?
Then I don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me.
I think it might also matter to Mitch.
Mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do. I'm not complaining. That's the mark of a man. But... You see, I... I wouldn't want to be... be left alone. I don't think I could bear being left alone. I... forgive me. This business with the birds has me upset. I... I don't know what I'd do if Mitch weren't here.
Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs. Brenner.
I wish I were stronger. Do you think she's all right? Do you think she's safe at the school?
Would you like me to go for her?
I couldn't ask you to.
I don't mind, really.
Would you? I'd feel so much better.
That's the last of it.
Did you close the door?
Please don't mess me up with bandages, Mrs. Brenner.
Shhhh. Shhhh.
That's a chimney swift, all right.
Well, these birds live in chimneys, you know.
Not by the thousands.
No, I gotta admit this is peculiar. Did you have a light burning or something.
Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know. Sure is a peculiar thing.
What are we going to do about it, Al?
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
What's more likely, they got in the room and was just panicked, that's all.
All right, I'll grant you a bird'll panic in an enclosed room. But, they didn't just get in. They came in! Right down that chimney.
My wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once.
Didn't know how he got in there. Had a broken leg, turned out. Just fluttering all around there.
These birds were...
Oh, yeah, yeah. How old is she now?
Does this room look silly?
Well, if there's anything else I can do, Mitch...
Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.
He was killed last night. By birds.
There's an ordinance against burning anything in this town, unless it's...
Is that for Mitch Brenner?
Yes.
He's not home.
He won't be back until Monday. I mean, if those birds are for him....
Monday?
Yes. I don't think you should leave them in the hall, do you?
Well, where did he go?
Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.
Bodega Bay? Where's that?
Up on the coast. About sixty miles north of here.
Sixty... Oh.
About an hour and a half on the freeway. Or two if you take the coast highway.
Oh.
I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm going away myself. Someone's got to feed them, I suppose.
Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.
I wonder if you could help me.
What?
Yes, what was it you were looking for, sir?
Lovebirds.
Lovebirds, sir?
Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true?
Well... yes, sir, there are.
These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.
I understand completely, sir.
As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.
No, of course not.
Do you have a pair that are just friendly?
I think so, sir. Now then, let me see.
Aren't these lovebirds?
No, sir, those are... redbirds.
The sign says strawberry finches.
Yes, we call them that too. Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds...
Those are canaries, Miss. Doesn't this make you feel awful?
Doesn't what make me...?
All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species.
I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.
Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
Are they moulting now?
Some of them are.
How can you tell?
Yes, I see. About those lovebirds, Miss...
Are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead? We have some very nice canaries this week.
What did you say?
I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.
But how... how do you know my name?
A little birdie told me. Good day, Miss Daniels. Madam.
I don't know you.
Ahhh, but I know you.
How?
We met in court.
We never met in court or anyplace else.
That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.
When?
Do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window?
I didn't break that window!
No, but your little prank did. The judge should have put you behind bars!
What are you? A policeman?
I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...
Right. I recognized you when I came in. I thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag. What do you think of that, Miss Daniels?
I think you're a louse.
I am. Good day. Madam.
And I'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds!
That was the damndest thing I ever saw.
What made it...
What's that?
So you're a lawyer.
That's right. What are you doing in Bodega Bay?
Do you practice here?
No, San Francisco. What are you...?
What kind of law?
Criminal.
Is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars?
Not everyone, Miss Daniels.
Ouch!
I'm sorry. What are you doing up here?
Didn't you see the lovebirds?
You came all the way up here to bring me those birds?
To bring your sister those birds. You said it was her birthday. Besides, I was coming up anyway.
What for?
To see a friend of mine. Will you please be careful?
I'm sorry. Who's your friend?
Why...
Yes?
Annie. Annie Hayworth.
Well, well, small world. Annie Hayworth.
Yes.
How do you know Annie?
We... we went to school together. College.
Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying?
Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.
I think we'll have to shave the hair. Deke, have you got a razor?
Oh, no you don't!
So you came up to see Annie, huh?
Yes.
I don't believe you. I think you came up to see me.
Why would I want to see you, of all people?
I don't know. But it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who I was, and where I lived and...
It was no trouble at all. I simply called my father's paper. Besides, I was coming up here anyway, I already told you...
You like me, huh?
I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and... I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.
What did it say?
Can't see a thing.
I can't say I like your seagulls much, either. I come all the way up here to...
But you were coming up anyway, remember?
I was! And all I get for my pains is a... a... a hole in the head!
Right next to the one you already had.
After all, you did go to the trouble of bringing up those birds.
Yes, but...
You are, aren't you?
Certainly, but...
With... with Annie, of course.
Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter to seven, will that be all right?
Annie... Annie may have made other plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I can find my own way.
You're sure now? You won't hire a boat or anything?
I'm sure.
Seven o'clock then.
Hi. Annie had no plans, huh? I'm glad you came. Are you hungry?
Famished.
Why did he shoot her?
He was watching a ball game on television.
What?
You'll be able to find your way back, won't you?
Oh, yes.
Will I be seeing you again?
San Francisco's a long way from here.
I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you. Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.
How does Mother know what I like to do?
I guess she and I read the same gossip columns.
Oh. That. Rome.
Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...
In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
Without any clothes on?
With all my clothes on! The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper. Anything they said...
You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?
I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...
The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd...
Yes, but...
...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or...
Yes.
...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?
Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.
Sure. Do you really know Annie Hayworth?
No. At least, I didn't until I came up here.
So you didn't go to school together.
No.
And you didn't come up here to see her.
No.
You were lying.
Yes, I was lying.
Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too?
I wrote the letter.
What did it say?
It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.
But you tore it up.
Yes.
Why?
Because it seemed stupid and foolish.
Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!
I told you what happened in Rome!
Do you expect me to believe...?
I'd still like to see you.
Why?
That might have been good enough in Rome last summer. But it's not good enough now.
It is for me.
But not for me.
What do you want ?
I really shouldn't have any more. I'm a little tipsy already.
I'm trying to get you to stay for dinner. We're going to have a lot of roast left over.
I couldn't possibly. I have to get back.
Cheers.
What's in this? Nitro-glycerin?
Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco?
Well... I have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing.
You have a job?
I have several jobs.
What do you do?
I do different things on different days.
Like what?
On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid. At the airport.
Helping travelers.
And on Tuesdays, I take a course in General Semantics at Berkeley. That's not a job, of course. I just take it because...
What about Thursdays and Fridays?
On Thursdays I have my meeting and lunch. I'm chairman of a group that's sending a little Korean boy through school. We plan how to raise funds and... things like that.
And Fridays? What do you do then?
Nothing. I go to bird shops on Fridays.
I'm glad you do.
Do you know what I was doing in that shop?
What?
I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. She's seventy years old, and veddy prim and strait-laced. She's coming back from Europe at the end of the month, and I'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her.
What'll it say?
You'll think me very bold, sir.
Are you all right?
You look a little shaken.
I... I am. Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual, is it? The gull yesterday when I was in the boat, and the one last night at Annie's, and now...
Last night? What do you mean?
A gull smashed into Annie's front door. Mitch... what's happening?
I don't know, Melanie. Look, do you have to go back to Annie's?
No, I have my things in the car.
Do you want some mustard with this?
Some cream?
I'll take Cathy up to bed.
Are you staying?
It smelled of the fire.
It's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? It's so beautiful and still now. I think I've got it all figured out, by the way.
Really? Tell me about it.
It's an uprising.
Of birds?
It all started several months ago with a peasant sparrow up in the hills, a malcontent. He went around telling all the other sparrows that human beings weren't fit to rule this planet, preaching wherever anyone would listen...
Growing a beard...
Yes, of course, he had to have a beard! 'Birds of the world, unite!' he kept saying, over and over...
So they united.
Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows out for kicks...
Well, they'll go along with anything.
Sure. But eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen. "Why should humans rule?" they asked themselves.
Hear!
Why should we submit ourselves to their domination?
Hear, hear!
And all the while, that sparrow was getting in his little messages. Birds of the world, unite!
Take wing!
What it was, probably...
Mmm?
They're probably hungry, that's all. This was a bad summer. They eat berries and... and nuts, you know, and the hills are all burned out, so they're probably searching for food wherever they can get it.
It's so damn quiet out there.
It was like that yesterday.
What do you mean?
After the gulls attacked.
I hadn't thought of that. And then the swifts came.
It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
Melanie, Melanie...
I'm frightened, Mitch.
No, no...
I'm frightened and confused and I... I think I want to go back to San Francisco where there are buildings and... and concrete and...
Melanie...
That was Al on the phone. He wants me to meet him out at the Fawcett place. Says some detectives from Santa Rosa'll be there in a little while. Will you be all right here?
I got here as fast as I could. Where's Cathy?
I think it's safe to get out now.
Don't let's take any chances.
The town looks clear.
The bay doesn't.
How long have they been gathering there?
I keep thinking of Annie.
It... it doesn't look very different, does it? A little smoke over the town, but otherwise...
Even the birds sitting out there. It does look very much the same, Mitch. This could be last week.
Do you want to try your father again?
I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
Have we still got power?
Where are they heading?
Inland.
Santa Rosa?
When will they stop?
I thought they'd have stopped by now.
What time is it?
Almost two a.m.
You must be exhausted.
You'd have been safe in San Francisco.
The power.
Mitch...
We'd better light some of those lamps.
Mitch, if they hear the car starting... if they see movement...
Can we turn back?
Hello, Mrs. MacGruder, have you ever seen so many gulls?
Hello, Miss Daniels.
I was hoping you'd be a little late, Miss Daniels. You see, he hasn't arrived yet.
You said three o'clock.
I know. Oh, I know. I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown.
And he'll talk?
Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk.
Yes.
Yes. Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock. Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting?
I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address.
I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call?
There we are!
That... that... who was that?
Have you got a pencil?
They said the myna bird would be here later this afternoon. If you'd care to come back...
No, you'd better send him. May I use your phone?
Yes, certainly.
Do you have any lovebirds?
No, not in the shop. But I can order them for you.
How soon?
Well... well, how soon would you want them?
Immediately. Is this the Daily News? Melanie Daniels. Would you get me the city desk, please?
I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning. Would that be all right?
No, the birds didn't attack until the children were outside the school. Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy. Is there a difference between crows and blackbirds?
There is very definitely a difference, Miss.
They're both perching birds, of course, but of quite different species. The crow is brachyrhynchos. The blackbird is cyanocephalus.
I just came from the school, madam. I don't know about their brain pans but...
Hello, may I speak to Mitch Brenner, please? Yes, I'll wait.
Yes, all right, I'll wait for you. Good-by.
I hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world.
The gulls were after your fish, Mr. Sholes. Really, let's be logical about this.
What were the crows after at the school?
What do you think they were after, Miss...?
Daniels. I think they were after the children.
For what purpose?
I don't know why.
Doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait all that time to start a... a war against humanity?
Have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest?
I have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do. Ornithology happens to be my avocation, Miss Daniels. You're talking about preservation of the species, a hen protecting her young. There's a vast difference between...
Maybe they're all protecting the species. Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and...
Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know.
And what? Vultures? Hawks? Eagles?
Maybe! Is it impossible?
Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.
No one ever said you were, Mitch.
Look, Mitch, even if this is true, even if all the birds...
Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't see any reason for it.
It's happening. Isn't that a good enough reason?
I like Bodega Bay as well as any man. If I thought...
Then help me, Sebastian. You're an important man in this town. If you'll help, the rest will.
Help how? What do you want to do?
I'm not sure, but...
I only know we've got to drive them away from town -- before they drive us away.
How?
How do you plan to do that?
How can we go on living here if we blanket the town with smoke?
Scotch, light on the water.
Birds?
Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
We need them.
Not if they're starting a war.
Then fight back. Get yourselves guns and wipe them off the face of the earth.
Kill them all. Get rid of them. Messy animals.
That's right, sir, I recall it. A large flock of seagulls got lost in a fog and headed in for the town, where all the lights were.
They made some mess, too, smashing into houses and everything. They always make a mess. We're better off without them.
How many gulls did you count, Mrs. Bundy?
Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.
The ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats.
Actually, those gulls must have been after the fish.
Of course.
Makes a lot more sense than... well, an attack.
I'm going out that way, lady. You can follow me.
Then let's go. Now!
I haven't finished my drink.
Were the Santa Rosa police at your school today? Are you coming?
Something like this happened in Santa Cruz last year. The town was covered with seagulls.
I'm leaving! Are you coming?
I'm Donald Fettes.
I'm very pleased to know you, Master Fettes.
Mr. Gray?
Dr. MacFarlane said I should pay you --
I fear he may have to.
But can't you give me any idea?
There, Master Fettes. Sooner than we had expected. A stoke of luck one might say.
Oh, you'll have ample opportunity -- ample -- Good morning, Dr. Fettes.
You asked to see me, ma'am?
I want you to help my little girl.
I'm only a student.
Georgina told me how kind you were to her. It gave me hope you might intercede for us with Dr. MacFarlane.
I don't know that I can do that, Mrs. Marsh.
I didn't mean it that way. I meant only that I am not in a position to ask favors.
Ask this one favor --
You have his promise, then?
-- pain -- and shock. She's brave enough, but I don't know about myself. Now that it seems so close, I wonder if I dare trust my child into any but God's hands. Maybe He knows best.
Good morning, Mrs. Marsh.
It's not because of Georgina -- because of Dr. MacFarlane's failure?
Even so, I could never think of going on -- I've got to find some other profession.
You must leave this house.
I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.
Save yourself. Master Fettes look at MacFarlane and be warned.
He's a great doctor -- a great man --
He could have been a great man -- a good man and a fine doctor, but there was always the shame of the old life and the old ways to hold him back -- and always Gray -- Gray to hound him to his death.
You're over-excited, Mistress Cameron.
I'm cold as ice.
But Gray's only a cab driver -- a Resurrection Man who robs graves to make a bit of money now and again.
If he were only that. The man's evil himself. Some day you'll know him as MacFarlane knows him -- for MacFarlane he was to Knox as you are to him. That brought him close to Gray, he roistered with him and drank with him. Aye, and Gray even brought him to my door and my love. There is all that between them and more
But that's long since. Gray can't threaten him with that.
Gray has no need to threaten. You remember the trial?
I heard my parents speak of it in Thrums. It was a famous case.
And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke?
Aye.
That porter was Gray and the gentleman of consequence who couldn't swallow the shame of it -- who took my last paltry savings to hire Gray --
Listen to me, Fettes, I'm one part befuddled with drink, one part over-heels in love with MacFarlane, and one part fey. You're a lowlander, Fettes, and you have no way of knowing what we Highlanders call the second sight.
I've heard of it.
He's not home.
Where can I find him?
You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.
But I must tell him -- he must know of it. Please -- tell me where he is.
There's no standing between a fool and his folly. If you must babble your news to him he's at the Fisherman's Tryst. It's the inn at Pennycuik. You can use MacFarlane's horse and gig to get there. He'll welcome the ride back.
At Pennycuik. I know the inn. I can be there in an hour.
Excuse me, Dr. MacFarlane --
But, Doctor, I only wanted to speak to you --
Dr. MacFarlane --
I'm afraid I'll have to give up medicine, Dr. MacFarlane.
You're made for a doctor, young man!
I'm afraid I have to, sir. You see, my father is vicar at Thrums -- it's a small parish -- not much of a living --
You're too good a man, Fettes -- I'll not let you quit. I'll make an assistant of you -- that'll pay your keep and your tuition, too --
I thought only the best students were made assistants.
Well? And are you not a good student?
But Richardson?
You know how we get the specimens we use for dissection?
I don't think I can go on, sir.
What the devil do you mean? You have your lodgings, a certain stipend -- I thought I had arranged everything for you --
And that's why you don't want to be a doctor, Fettes?
But this woman -- and her son --
Dr. MacFarlane -- you remember the lady who came to see you yesterday -- the lady with the little girl?
I remember her.
She came again today. She wanted me to ask you if you would not break your rule and operate. She feels you are her only hope.
It was about last night I wanted to talk to you -- about the operation on the little Marsh girl.
You're a man of the world, Fettes, you wouldn't hold me to promise given in drink.
But I -- well, you see, sir, I met Mrs. Marsh and told her.
Really, Fettes, you irk me with your lack of understanding.
But you did promise.
Look here, Fettes. Not I nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation. I would have to study the matter. Have we any "subjects"?
Wilmont used up the last spinal section.
You see, it is completely out of the question.
Yes, I suppose so.
Every street singer with a cracked voice gives tongue to that one.
Well --
Gray killed her.
We can't be sure of that.
I wouldn't do that, Fettes. I wouldn't report it.
I don't know that -- neither do you. This subject may have been an epileptic -- thrown a fit -- fallen out of bed -- cracked her skull and killed herself -- there is everything explained -- the bruise on her head --
I can't believe that.
But, I didn't ask him to kill.
Here is where you must watch closely, gentleman -- closely -- it is the very heart of the matter --
She's unconscious.
I just saw Gray. What was he laughing at?
He has his own idea of a joke. Perhaps his horse tickled him in the ribs.
I've just been to see Mrs. Marsh. Georgina is doing splendidly. The incision has healed -- clean and fine -- but she doesn't seem to have any desire to walk.
When she's ready you bring her to me -- I'll show her how.
Dr. MacFarlane, I wonder if you know what happiness you've brought those people.
I suppose one must pass through this purgatory to the heaven of being a good doctor.
You can't -- can't! Stop trying to bribe her with childishness about white horses. Let the child stand and walk -- her spine's all right. I know it's all right.
But she must want to stand. She must want to walk.
Fettes, the more things are wrong, the more we must act as if everything were right. You must do with Joseph as you did with, the street singer -- complete dissection -- a proper entry in the book --
No.
What do you mean, Fettes?
I'll have no more to do with it. I'll not put my neck into the noose, not even for your sake, Dr. MacFarlane.
What's that you say?
The little girl -- she couldn't walk far -- the muscles are too weak -- but she did stand and she took a step or two.
I know it -- I know it -- The moment I was rid of him --
What?
See that, Fettes?
A burial party -- poor people -- it's hard to bury a loved one on a rainy day when the churchyard is so cold and lonely.
Glencorse -- that's a lonely cemetery, Fettes, not a soul around for miles.
They'll be thinking of that, too.
Tosh! Fettes! It's not their grief I'm worrying about -- I'm talking of our own end --
You've no thought of going there?
Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel? I've had some practice in the art.
You couldn't do that, Doctor.
I pass up no opportunities, I've a whole course of lectures in mind for you fellows. We'll need subjects to demonstrate. Come along.
No.
Where shall we put it? In the back?
This is not a woman!
It was a woman when we put her in.
Are you a doctor, too?
Not yet.
What you really want to ask me is about my back, isn't it -- about where it hurts?
Why, yes.
Hear him?
The white horse. The horse that is going to greet me when he sees me.
Why do you want the white horse to bid you "good-day"?
He was a nice horse.
Of course -- I don't have friends. That's because I can't walk. I try to make myself used to it.
Aye, but I still wonder how much.
I want it --
Don't you want to find the white horse, Georgina? You can't find him from a wheelchair. You have to walk and run to find him.
I thought this was a school day.
You'll not need that again, Georgina.
He'll not leave the grave -- not since Wednesday last when we buried the lad.
Not much danger here, ma'am, I wouldn't think -- right here in the heart of Edinburgh.
They're uncommon bold, the grave robbers -- and the daft doctors who drive them on.
I'm by way of being a medical myself.
A doctor?
Come, Toddy -- come. Sit down here with me.
Don't call me that confounded name.
Mr. Fettes and I have professional matters to discuss.
I will not have you use that name to me.
You're a teacher, eh? Maybe you're afraid to be a doctor, Toddy.
Afraid of what?
Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.
I am the best man for the job.
You? Why? Since when have you become the protector of little children?
I'm not concerned about the child, Toddy. It's you I'm thinking of, I'd like to see you prove that a lot of things I know haven't hurt Toddy MacFarlane any.
I'll not do it, Gray.
Oh, yes, you will. You'll do it to oblige Fettes and myself.
No.
It might be an interesting case.
Toddy hates me.
Don't call me that confounded name, I tell you.
Now that wasn't a friendly thing I heard, Toddy. Not at all friendly.
That has nothing to do with it. We've decided to do more lecturing and less dissection -- it's better for the students -- that's all there is to it.
You know what you want and don't want -- so that's an end of business between us -- but we'll still be friends, Toddy. I'll be dropping by to see you and Meg once in a while -- for auld lang syne, you know.
Oh, it's you, Gray. Well, come in. Sit down. Have a glass with me.
You know something about the human body, Gray.
I've had some experience.
Then you can understand that the backbone is a lot of little blocks and those little blocks are all held together, so that it works like that whip of yours. You know that, don't you?
I've never had it all explained that way to me by so learned a man.
I set those blocks together, patched the muscles. I put the nerves where they should be -- I did it and I did it right -- and she won't walk --
Oh, it's the bit of a girl Fettes was talking about.
You can't build life like you put together blocks, Toddy.
What are you talking about? I am an anatomist. I know the body. I know how it works.
And you're a fool, Toddy -- and no doctor. It's only the dead ones that you know.
I am a doctor. I teach medicine.
Like Knox taught you? Like I taught you? In cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow?
The heart pumps it.
Did he tell you how thoughts come and how they go and why things are remembered and forgot?
The nerve centers -- the brain --
But what makes a thought start?
In the brain, I tell you. I know.
I am a doctor - a good doctor. I could make her walk, but she won't - she won't --
Why should I be afraid of you? What are you holding over me?
I'll tell you what, Toddy. It's because I ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood. It's because you were afraid to face it -- and you're still afraid.
Aye, Toddy, there is something in what you say.
There is much in what I say, Gray, and if you have any regard for your neck you'll leave now and stay away from my house, my school, and from me.
What are you going here? Have I not told you --
I brought you something tonight, MacFarlane -- an interesting specimen -- in very good condition.
I've ordered nothing from you.
This is a gift.
I take no gifts from you.
This is a gift you'll not return.
Get out of here!
Wait, Toddy. That's not hospitable. I want to discuss business.
Gray, I must rid myself of you -- you've become a cancer -- a malignant, evil cancer -- rotting my mind.
So, Toddy, you've made me a disease, eh?
Surely you are not threatening an old friend, Toddy.
Have another glass of something good, Toddy.
I've drunk enough tonight.
You're getting old, Gray, and it's a hard life driving a cab through these wet and windy streets of Edinburgh --
I have other means of sustenance.
What I was going to say is this -- wouldn't you be more comfortable at Leith in a neat little house?
Would you bribe me to leave you be?
I would make you rich.
It wouldn't be half so much fun for me. Toddy, as to have you come here and beg --
Well then -- I beg you -- I beseech you --
But why, Gray? Why?
Because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more, Toddy. You're a pleasure to me.
A pleasure to torment me?
I presume you shall. This won't be my last visit here.
I want to speak to you alone. I saw something. I heard.
What did you hear?
You're welcome to my little nest, Joseph -- is it not? That's right -- you have something to say to me -- something very private.
Yes.
Can anyone hear what we say?
Only Brother.
You say you've come here on your own account? No one knows you are here?
I have made you give me money, but you smile. Aren't you angry?
You and I should work together.
You mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? Dig them up?
No digging Joseph. The churchyards are too well guarded. We will "Burke" them,
Burke them?
You are lately come to Scotland, Joseph?
I come from Lisbon.
"The ruffian dogs, the Hellish pair. The villain Burke, the meager Hare --"
I never heard that song. But what did they do?
But where did they get those people?
"A good-day to you Madame Tosspot, and would you like a little glass of something before you take your rest? Come with me to my house and I'll make you my guest. You shall have quarts to drink if you like." Ah, how he cozened them.
We could do that. But when he had them there, then what?
I don't understand the song. Tell me plain how they did it.
Was the paralysis immediate?
No, Doctor. She seemed to get better, then about six months later she began to complain of pain in her back --
How long after that was the paralysis complete?
Nearly a year.
Any attacks of pain since?
Yes, Doctor.
Is her pain sporadic or constant?
It comes at intervals. They used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent -- much more frequent.
Child seems to take to the lad. What sort of an accident was it, Ma'am?
A carriage overturned. My husband was killed and Georgina was hurt.
How long ago?
But can anything be done for her?
Believe me, Madame, if I were only a doctor, I would undertake this operation at once. But I'm more dominie than doctor -- I've a school to run.
But, Doctor, surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run --
I regret it, Ma'am, but I have the responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own.
There's nothing I can say for one small child?
I'm sorry, Doctor. Georgina's a good child -- a brave child -- you saw how she was during the operation -- but if she can't move, she can't move.
But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
She would if she could.
And why not? He's a good lad -- bright and able.
Aye. He's a good lad. That's why I ask you, MacFarlane.
You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?
Aye --
You're daft. What's Gray to me. He's only a man from whom I buy what I need when I need it -- the rest is forgotten.
You may deny the devil, Toddy, but you'll not rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead.
Nonsense. You're a fey creature with mad ideas. But you have a wildness that holds me to you, lass.
Crony indeed!
Fettes -- where is Fettes?
You're not going to Gray.
You've been with Gray again.
I hate that picture.
Where are they?
Can I get you something? A glass of water? A transfusion?
Where are they? Last chance.
around, or whatever the hell you're doing here. What are you doing here?
I'm looking for my friends.
How many innocent people did you leave dead back there?
You sent them. I had no choice.
It was one thing her dad rejected you. But when she did you lost it.
You're wrong.
Was that it? Well, ok.
What's been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace. And I'll be seeing her again soon. Only what will I say? That I was too stupid to find the guy who killed her? That he's down here laughing?
Tell her... we'll get him.
We won't.
Check and mate.
Two down. Two to go.
"Down?" Wait, don't tell me.
You think I'm crazy.
Lauren's father's involved. He bought the cops fancy cars, I don't know what else. It's a company called D-E-L-T. I think Lauren found out.
What do they do that they had to kill her?
I was hoping you'd find out.
Leonard, Dutton, Erlich. They don't matter. I want the King.
We're getting there. Because in his so-called construction job, Tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called "The Hole."
The strip joint?
Where is it? This place?
I think we should get some support?
That was a fucking hollow point!
Think maybe knives do?
Keep that thing away from me.
Fuck! What do you want?
A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.
You killed her. I saw it.
Sssshhh. She's resting.
Where the fuck did you come from?
You lied at my trial.
I don't know you, man.
Hey. I said what I saw. Two kids arguing. A guy and a girl.
You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
One chance to tell the truth, Tommy. Who is the man with the scar? He planted this in my car.
Wrong. Answer.
What did they give you?
They showed me pictures, what he did to her. Evidence. Said all I had to do was stand up there and not my head "yes."
What did they give you?
We're going to play a little game called "Who's got the Scar."
What Scar? What fucking scar?
You're him! You're Corvis! We fried your ass. You're dead, man!
Fucking Zombie.
The scar.
I heard you were looking for this.
You're the guy killed Dutton.
Fuck. Me.
Not my arm! What you fucking want?
I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.
The scar. Which of you has it?
Are you out of your fucking mind? We're going to die.
How can you die if you're already dead?
You're him. Corvis.
I was a friend of your sister's.
I know her friends.
Yeah, no kidding.
Your father gave them to both of you.
And he's right over there by the way. What did you do to your face?
Someone else did it.
You're a friend of the guy who killed her, aren't you? You almost sound like him.
He didn't kill her.
How do you know?
I know everything about your sister. I'll prove it to you.
Daisy. How did you know?
I told you, I knew your sister.
You killed that cop Dutton.
I know who you are. That's why you paint your face. To hide.
I'm not hiding. I'm right here.
I've been shot, and stabbed and thrown from a car and none of it hurt. But what you're doing now, does. I don't know why.
My dad was right! He said you'd ruin her life.
From the bonfire over there. Look at it.
No! Why are you haunting me?
This is where it happened. Right over here.
Are you ok?
When Lauren was missing the police came to our house. They said they were looking for her, right? But I know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you...
No...
Erin. It's not your fault.
It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead.
No. You don't.
This tree. Here's where it happened.
... took everything I ever cared about. Left me with nothing.
So you're going to kill him?
You know what Lauren and I were fighting about that night? She had a secret, wouldn't tell me...
My father.
All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy.
I wish I could hate him but I can't. He said he'd never hurt either of us, and I know it's true and... I'm going back.
It's ok, it's ok...
It's not. I can't take it.
Erin. Who?
... it connects you to me...
In the woods you said you had nothing. But you wouldn't, and I wouldn't if there's some way you don't have to go. Please. At least not right away.
I thought we had an understanding. I thought we understood that discretion is paramount.
Yeah, we do.
Erlich gimping around in his goddamn hot rod is not discreet. I've got reporters asking me how much he made. I've got the entire force looking at this case now.
I know.
You know.
Tommy Leonard. The eyewitness in the Corvis case.
Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment yesterday.
Guy dressed for Halloween?
They botched the execution.
Could say that.
Fucking crow.
How about sign of a big black bird?
Cause if you're losing your mind, I got a right to know.
Just don't believe everything you see.
Doubt is a motherfucker.
Maybe we had a case of that here. Get me my kit.
Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan? Because there's a ghost threatening us.
You mean Alex.
Because you never accepted that what happened to her was an accident.
An accident, Nathan.
I watched her grow up. Just like you. I know how her mind worked. She kept snooping around because she was worried about you. What you'd gotten yourself into. So stop blaming me. And blame yourself.
I do. Every day.
Anything wrong?
What's with your friend there?
She's... sick. Actually she never had Mai Tais before.
But you, you've had them.
If you had a license, I bet I'd have seen it by now. How old are you? Fifteen?
You want me to walk a straight line?
I want you... to bend over.
Look, can I just call a cab?
Why are there so many?
I want to take this to Lauren. She'd want it.
Honey. I just can't.
Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.
Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
Erin!
What were you yelling about?
This guy said he was a friend of Lauren's. He had like paint all over his face.
Are you ok?
What is it?
What? What is it?
Lauren called me that when we were little. Daisy. No one knew but us.
Honey. It's doesn't mean anything. It's not a message.
That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren.
It still doesn't mean...
I think I dropped an earring.
You're in with them.
It's not what you think.
You killed her!
No.
Stay away from me! Stay away!
They killed her because she found out.
About you.
Sweetheart...
I would never hurt you or Lauren. Never. Believe me.
I don't believe you.
Please. Come inside.
You should see it, Professor Barnhardt! You should go out and see it for yourself!
Thanks -- I'm enjoying it right here.
The whole city has stopped. People are running around like ants!
What about the people who are coming to the meeting tonight? Have they all arrived?
I talked to most of them this morning... They were all very curious about the meeting.
Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter?
He'll be there at 8:30.
Tell me, Hilda -- does all this frighten you -- does it make you feel insecure?
Yes, sir -- it certainly does!
You wrote this?
It was a clumsy way to introduce myself -- but I understand you're a difficult man to see. I thought you'd have the solution by this time.
Yes -- that will reproduce the first- order terms. But what about the effect of the other terms?
Almost negligible... With variation of parameters, this is the answer.
How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory?
I find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another. I understand you've called a meeting to study our space ship.
As though unsure of what he's heard) Yes -- yes, I have.
You have faith, Professor Barnhardt
It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity. Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.
I would like to explain something of my mission here.
That was my first question.
It was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the Earth -- but I was not allowed the Opportunity. I have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society. We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. We also know that
Yes -- that is true.
In the hands of a mature civilization, these would not be considered weapons of aggression. But in the hands of your people-- We've observed your aggressive tendencies, and we don't trust you with such power.
If you mean that you are afraid of us--
We want to be sure you don't make -- let us say -- an unfortunate mistake. We know the potentiality of these developments and we are disturbed to find them in the hands of children... You see, we've had atomic energy for five thousand of your years. We discarded instruments like this many centuries ago. So long as you were limited to fighting among
These other planets -- do they have peace and security?
We had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago. After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos.
We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists. What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?
I came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared, however, to offer a solution.
Would you care to be more specific?
I gather that your efforts on the official level were not entirely successful.
I come to you as a last resort -- and I confess that my patience is wearing thin. Must I take drastic action in order to get a hearing?
What -- what sort of action do you mean?
Would you be willing to meet with the group of scientists I am calling together?. Perhaps you could explain your mission to them, and they in turn could present it to their various peoples.
It is not enough to have men of science. We scientists are too easily ignored -- or misunderstood. We must get important men from every field. Educators -- philosophers -- church leaders -- men of vision and imagination -- the finest minds in the world.
I leave that in your hands.
You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?
No -- not at all.
What about your personal safety in the meantime? What about the Army -- and the police?
My name is Carpenter and I'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house.
I'm afraid I can't offer you any real protection. I have no influence in cases of inter-planetary conspiracy.
I'm sure I'll be quite safe until the meeting.
One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?
Such power exists?
The people who came to the meeting must be made to realize this. They must understand what is at stake. You mentioned a demonstration of force--
Yes.
Would such, a demonstration be possible before the meeting?
Yes -- of course.
Something that would dramatize for them and for their people the seriousness of the situation. Something that would affect the entire planet.
That can easily be arranged.
I wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- or destroy anything.
Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.
Maybe a little demonstration.
Bet he is, Mom. Bet he's out looking for that space man.
Can I help you look for the space man? Can I? I know what he looks like! He's got a square head -- and, three great big eyes!
Hi Mom!
Did you have a nice day, dear?
Come on, Bobby. Time to go to bed.
Mom -- why does Mr. Carpenter have to go down to the police station?
We sure had fun today. We saw the space ship and we went to see Professor Barnhardt -- and--
Professor Barnhardt.
Yeah, sure. Mom, do I have to go to school tomorrow?
Of course, dear.
Go to bed, darling. You can finish that in the morning.
Bobby -- I think it would be better if we didn't see quite so much of Mr. Carpenter
Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... And he's awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt.
Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go to see Professor Barnhardt?
Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?
What do you mean, dear?
I mean -- on account of that policeman last night. You think he's a bank robber, maybe? Or a gangster?
Bobby--! What are you doing up at this hour?
I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!
Tell me what?
I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
Now, Bobby, just a minute--
Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!
Bobby, you've been dreaming again.
Now think back hard. You didn't follow Mr. Carpenter at all, did you? You haven't even been out of the house.
Yes, I have!
He gave these to you?
Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he's a diamond smuggler?
Oh, boy -- can I, Mom?
Yes, dear. Come on now. Bobby, your shoes are soaking!
Are you an FBI man?
Bobby -- who's the greatest man in America today?
Gee -- I don't know... The space man, I guess.
Well -- Professor Barnhardt, I guess. He's the greatest scientist in the world.
He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?
Sure. Right near where my mother works.
Where is that?
Boy, I'll bet he's strong. I bet he could knock down a whole building.
Gee, I'd like to get inside and see how it works. What do you think makes it go?
Well -- atomic power, I would imagine.
I thought that was only for bombs.
No. It's for a lot of other things, too.
You think it can go faster than an F- 36?
Maybe four thousand miles an hour. And outside the Earth's atmosphere a good deal faster.
Gee! How could they make a landing?
You think they'll ever find him?
I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
Bobby -- I have an idea. Let's go see Professor Barnhardt and find out how he talks.
You're just kidding, aren't you?
Wouldn't you like to meet him?
Well, sure I would, but -- Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.
What does that mean?
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
Did all these people die in wars?
Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
No -- I'm afraid not.
Mr. Carpenter" -- you don't seem to know about anything.
I'll tell you, Bobby -- I've been away for a long time. Very far away.
Is it different where you've been? Don't they have places like this?
Go to the movies.
All right.
No foolin'? Will you?
I've got some money. My mother gave me two dollars.
Gee -- those look like diamonds!
Some places that's what people use for money. They're easy to carry -- and they don't wear out.
Bet they're worth about a million dollars.
Would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them?
Let's not say anything to my mother about this, Mr. Carpenter.
Why not, Bobby?
Mrs. Benson -- this is Mr. Brady.
We certainly did.
Aw, gee -- we didn't finish our story.
We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, Bobby.
All you have to remember is, first find the common denominator -- then subtract.
Thanks, Mr. Carpenter.
Bobby -- have you a flashlight?
What do you want it for, Mr. Carpenter?
The skeletal structure is completely normal. Same for the major organs - heart, liver, spleen, kidneys.
And the lungs are the same as ours. Must mean a similar atmosphere -- similar pressure. How old do you think he is?
Oh, I'd say forty-five.
He told me this morning when I examined him. He's seventy-eight.
I don't believe it.
Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty.
How does he explain that?
My name is Harley -- Secretary to the President I've been told that you speak our language -- that your name is Mr. Klaatu.
Just Klaatu.
The President asked me to convey his deepest apologies for what has happened. We all feel--
I'm sure I don't have to point out that your arrival was something of a surprise. Had you been traveling long?
About five months -- your months.
You must have come a long way.
Naturally we're very curious to know where it is you come from.
It's rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor.
I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.
The present situation?
I mean the reasons for my coming here.
We're very curious about that, too. Would you care to talk about it?
I'd be glad to. Not now, of course -- with you alone.
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
This is not a personal matter, Mr. Harley. It concerns all the people on your planet.
I -- I'm not sure I understand--
I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth.
I'm afraid that would be a little awkward. It's -- it's completely without precedent. And there are practical considerations -- the time involved -- the enormous distances.
I traveled 250 million miles. What about your United Nations?
You know about the United Nations?
We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years. That's how we learned your languages. Lately, we've been getting your television also.
You must have a rather strange impression of us.
I'm sure you recognize from our broad- casts the evil forces that have produced the tension in our world. Surely you would agree--
I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with the internal affairs of your planet. I consider that to be your business -- not mine.
I was only hoping to make you understand.
My mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles. It concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on Earth.
Perhaps if you could explain a little--
We could call a special meeting of the General Assembly... But of course the UN doesn't represent all of the nations.
Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State?
I will make that recommendation to the President. I must tell you in all honesty that I'm extremely dubious about the results.
Apparently I'm not as cynical about Earth's people as you are.
Good afternoon. I'm glad to see you up and around.
Thank you... Have you any news?
I tried to make you understand. The suspicions -- the jealousies -- the mistrust-- Surely you realize that my government has done everything in its power--
It's not your government I'm thinking about. It's your world.
Now that you understand the situation more clearly, perhaps you'd like to discuss the matter with the President
I will not speak to any one nation or group of nations. I don't intend to add my contribution to your childish jealousies and suspicions.
Our problems are very complex, Mr. Klaatu. You mustn't judge us too harshly.
I can judge only by what I see.
Your impatience is quite understandable.
I am impatient with stupidity. My people have learned to live without it.
Before making any decisions, I think I should get out among your people -- become familiar with the basis for these strange, unreasoning attitudes.
We're all set. I picked up some sandwiches and put gas in the car. And the radio's still busted, so me can forget about the space man for today.
There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby. I don't suppose we could take him with us?
Well, we could--
It was a wonderful day.
You still haven't answered my question.
You know how I feel, Tom. I just want to think it over.
The boss is leaving for Chicago tomorrow. If I could tell him I was getting married -- with two dependents--
You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it.
Hello--
You ready?
I will be in just a minute.
The picture starts at eight-fifty.
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.
Oh, Tom, that was awful.
He's not there. But look what I found in his room
Is it real?
I wonder if we ought to--
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
You think it's all right for you to stay here?
I'm at Bleeker's getting an appraisal on that diamond. I thought we might have lunch together.
Tom -- I've been trying to get you all afternoon--
I've got some terrific news about your friend, Mr. Carpenter.
What about him?
Helen, he's the man from the space ship! I had that diamond checked at three different places. Nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that! After what Bobby told us, that's enough for me. Why is it nobody knows anything about him? Why hasn't he got any money?
All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.
How do you know?
Never mind about that. You've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody.
Are you crazy? After what happened today?
You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.
Important? Of course it's important. The point is we can do something about it.
That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm talking about.
He's a menace to the whole world! It's our duty to turn him in.
But he isn't a menace! He told me what he came here for.
He told you... Don't be silly, honey -- just because you like the guy. You realize what this'd mean for us? I'd be the biggest man in the country. I could write my own ticket.
Is that what you're thinking about?
Tom, you mustn't -- ! You don't know what you're doing! It isn't just you and Mr. Carpenter. The rest of the world, is involved!
You'll feel different when you see my picture in the papers.
I feel different right now.
You wait and see. You're going to marry a big hero!
I don't know how to thank you.
Everyone seems so--
Bobby's the only person I know who isn't -- Jittery.
He has his homework to keep him occupied.
He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.
Naturally I think so.
Mr. Carpenter -- this is none of my business, but -- why did that detective come here last night?
Excuse me. I was just going up to my room.
Mr. Carpenter, I-- Goodnight.
Oh -- hello--
May I see you for a minute?
I -- I was Just going to lunch.
I saw Bobby this morning before he went to school--
Yes--?
I want to know what he told you last night.
I -- I didn't really pay much attention-- Bobby has such an active imagination.
What is it you want?
What happened?
Just twelve.
We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes.
We could try pushing the other buttons. I have a flashlight in my purse.
Why not?
You hold great hope for this meeting.
It must be twelve-thirty.
Where are you going now?
No, wait a minute -- there's someone else.
Who?
I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting.
Where is the meeting going to be?
It's only a few blocks to Barnhardt's.
I'm worried about Gort. I'm afraid of what he might do -- if anything should happen to me.
Gort? But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do?
There's no limit to what he could do. He could destroy the Earth. If anything should happen to me, you must go to Gort. You must give him this message: "Klaatu barada nikto." Please repeat that.
"Klaatu barada nikto."
Hello.
I -- I thought you were--
I was.
You mean he has the power of life and death?
No -- that is a power reserved to the Almighty Spirit.
This technique, in certain cases, can re-stimulate life for a limited period. It's a refinement of scientific principles known to your own people.
But how -- how long--?
We'll miss you very much -- Bobby and I. He won't have anyone to play with.
He'll have you -- and Tom.
No. That's all finished.
I'm sorry.
How dare you write on that blackboard! Do you realize the Professor has been working on that problem for weeks?
He'll catch on to it in no time now.
How did you get in here? And what do you want?
We came to see Professor Barnhardt.
Well, he's not here. And he won't be back till this evening. I think you'd better leave now. Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad. He tears off the piece of paper and hands it to Hilda.
Is it worth anything?
I have never seen such a stone. Will you please tell me where it came from?
That's what I wanted you to tell me.
You sure about that?
Would you like to sell it?
No -- no, thanks.
The Professor's secretary says she found you in Barnhardt's room, making marks on his blackboard.
Oh, I see. He was having trouble and you were helping him out.
That's right.
I suppose you know that Barnhardt does a lot of secret work for the Army.
In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much. He doesn't know the answer himself.
But I suppose you know the answer.
Your name's Carpenter -- that right? Any identification, Mr. Carpenter? Driver's license -- social security number?
No -- I'm afraid not.
Well, how do I know who you are?
Okay -- book him and get him fixed up. Looks like everybody's goin' nuts.
They would have killed this man?
People get hysterical enough, they do anything. Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself, I got to send you over to the Army.
How long will that take?
May I suggest that you call the Professor?
Just passing through Santa Carla?
I don't like horror comics.
How do you like Santa Carla?
Yeah, you think we just work in a comic book store for our dad, huh?
We're fighters for Truth, Justice, and the American Way.
I don't like horror comics.
Think of this more as a survival manual... there's our number on the back, and pray that you never need to call us.
All day.
Can't stand light?
Salt sticks to the bottom of his feet.
Yeah.
Why not?
He's my brother.
They wouldn't be out in the daytime.
<u>I'll</u> have to drive!
We don't ride with vampires.
Burn rubber does not mean <u>warp</u> <u>speed</u>!
They're gaining on us!
Well... we blew Plan A.
Time to activate Plan B.
We've been aware of some very serious vampire activity in this town for a long time.
Santa Carla has become a haven for the undead.
All together?
Okay. Where's Nosferatu?
The Prince of Darkness.
The nightcrawler. The bloodsucker.
Should I run him through?
Shut up!
We unraveled in the face of the enemy!
They're looking at us.
Good.
Did you see that sucker burn?!
Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
Two down and two to go.
<u>Four</u> to go.
Whattaya mean?
Those two we brought back with us. The girl and the kid. I don't trust 'em. I say we terminate 'em while we can.
Death to all vampires!
Maximum body-count.
We are awesome monster-bashers!
The meanest!
We still going?
Honda 250, huh?
That's right.
C'mon, Star. Climb on.
I can't beat a Triumph.
We were gonna grab some food.
So how do you like those maggots, Michael?
What?...
Don't! Stop!
I'm my own man.
What's going' on?
Where is she?!
Hey, take it easy.
Where's Star, David?!
What is this, David?
Where you going?
For a ride.
With him?
C'mon, Michael. I want to go.
Leave him alone.
Look.
You can't kill me, Star.
I will, David!
And these Archies should be over here with the Richie Rich's.
Where the hell are you from, Kryton???
Or a vampire.
Are you guys sniffing old newsprint or something?
This is just our cover. We're dedicated to a higher purpose.
Bad breath? Long fingernails?
Get yourself a good sharp stake and drive it through his heart.
I have something to tell you guys. Not only is my own brother showing systems of being a vampire... but now I'm convinced my mother's <u>dating</u> one!
That is very probable. What's your reasoning?
I wish they were vampires so I could nuke them in their hearts.
He's not glowing.
He's telling the truth! Aren't you, Michael?
Just so you know: If you try to stop us, or vamp-out in any way, I'll stake you without thinking twice about it.
What's that smell!?
I thought they'd be in coffins.
Oh, no...
What?
No, Nanook! Quiet!
We don't have one yet. And we only have two and a half hours to come up with one.
What happens in tow and a half hours?
Of course not!
David.
I don't want names! Just lead me to him. Where's their nest?
I said, <u>I'll take you there</u>. Nobody's going near Star without me.
Don't go out there! Stop him!
Lucy, you're the only woman I ever knew didn't improve her situation by getting divorced.
Ouch, my hair...
I can't sleep with the closet door open, either. Not even a crack. Your father doesn't mind, though. It could be wide open for all he cared. I think one of the reasons I divorced him was because he never believed... in the horror... of the <u>closet monster</u>!
Dad! Don't sneak up on people like that!
Smells good. When do we eat?
I told Max eight o'clock.
Max? You men we're having company again?
'Again'? Dad... you haven't had company in this house since Mom died eight years ago.
... And stay outta here.
You have a T.V.?
Thanks, Grandpa...
Grandpa, stop doin' the Indian Walk!
Gotta keep in practice. It's a dyin' art.
Good!
Whatcha doin' over here?
Oh... I was just... having a look at your truck. What's all that wood in there for?
Been fixin' to build me fence one of these days. Bought all the materials, then put it off... for about ten years. Well, one more day won't hurt. Wanna go into town with me?
Are we havin' fun or what?
I thought we were goin' into town.
Grandpa, the Widow Johnson called. She said to pick her up a seven instead of eight.
Did we have a date tonight?
I guess so. She said not to be late.
Hi... I'm Laddie.
I had the dream again about <u>them</u>.
Who, Laddie?
I know it was them, Star. I'm sure of it. He was working in the yard -- hammering something. The yard was big with lots of grass. There was no boardwalk and no ocean. She was bringing him something cold to drink... and had red hair. I was there, too. And a dog -- but I don't know its name. I was running and
Laddie... you can <u>still</u> remember. You can still remember home.
It was a dream, Star.
You didn't tell David?
No. Just you.
You like Michael.
I like Michael.
Still mad at me?
For what.
He looks dead.
He's just a deep sleeper.
It's early. Why do we have to go home?
Bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want... well 'til eleven thirty maybe.
I'll hitch.
See you later.
I get off in another twenty minutes. I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.
Michael, are you still in bed?
No. I'm up.
Michael, will you do me a favor this evening? Will you stay home with Sam tonight? I'm meeting Max for dinner after work.
I watch him all day. The only time I have more myself is at night. Let Grandpa watch him.
Okay?
Sure.
Does that mean we are, or we aren't?
We are...
-- If there's a girl, we could talk about her.
I'm tired now.
Wait a minute, kiddo.
Max is coming for dinner, Michael. I'd like you to meet him.
Can't. Got plans of my own.
There's only three weeks left of summer, Michael. Things are going to change around here when school starts.
I <u>didn't</u> invite you in this time!
Michael!...
We're getting close...
What's that smell?
Ocean air!
Smells like something died.
Mom, there's an amusement park right on the beach!
That's the boardwalk, Sam.
Tell them to get something to eat.
I thought we were poor.
When you ran away from home, hitch- hiked to Berkeley, spent the night in Golden Gate Park and begged for spare change in the morning?
You've heard this story before?
Help me, Mom. Help.
He met a girl.
I guess no one cares what I got a job.
Lights out, Sam.
Sam. Is everything all right?
Mom. I think we've got to have a long talk about something?
What's wrong? Tell me.
Sam! What happened!? You had me scared to death. Are you all right?
Where's Michael?
Can I sleep in here with you tonight?
In here?
Do you mind? It was a real scary comic.
These are my dinner guests. Edgar and Alan. The Frog Brothers.
Ah... I didn't know you were having guests...
Well if we're in your way we can just eat peanut butter out of the jar in the kitchen.
Nanook, stop breathin' on me.
Oh, no. Now what?
What did you say?
Vampires, Mom! Everywhere! You've got to tell the police! The newspapers! The TV stations! They'll listen to you. They'll believe you... you're a <u>mom</u>!
Not funny, Sam!
This is not a joke. They know that we know about them. They're coming to the house as soon as it gets dark!
Stop it, Sam. Stop it right now!
But, Mom...
Not another word! I can't believe you're doing this. I'm going to see Max tonight and you're trying to ruin it for me again.
No, I'm not...
There's nothing wrong with Max. I don't know why you don't --
Ohmygod...
Mom!
You've got a generous nature. I like that in a person. My name is Max.
Lucy.
So what can I help you find tonight, Lucy? We've got it all. Best selection in Santa Carla.
I'm not looking for a tape. What I need is --
-- a job.
Say hello to Thorn.
You're cute, Max.
Not impressed, are you?
So, I've met the one woman on the planet who's going to hold my success against me.
You seem like a terrific guy, Max, and I'm grateful for the job...
But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?
I guess if I had my choice, I'd like to do something that involves children. Work with kids in some way. Teenagers, maybe. And Santa Carla seems to be full of them.
Yeah. Runaways, mostly. They come from all over. Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean. Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute.
Is it okay for the guest to see the food before the dinner?
You're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding.
This looks terrific, Lucy.
Max! What's wrong?
I'm really sorry, Max.
Our batting average isn't very good is it? So far we're zero for two.
I don't understand Sam. He's just not like this.
Boys Sam's age need a good deal of discipline, or they walk all over you.
He doesn't walk all over me.
Maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change.
Something the matter?
No, no. Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.
Let me tell you something about boys. They're like weeds. They grow best when they're ignored.
I thought you said they needed discipline?
Max... what are you talking about?
Will somebody please tell me what this is all about!?
How about a little Parmesan cheese on that?
Does it burn?
I am?
But you passed the test!
Michael invited me in. Never invite a vampire into your house. It renders you powerless.
Are you following me?
Well, I...
Well... yeah. Sure.
Okay. Talk.
Hi...
What's your name?
Star.
Oh. Your folks, too, huh?
What do you mean?
Ex-hippies. My mom was one. I came this close to being called Moon Child, or Moon Beam or something. But Star's great. I <u>like</u> Star.
Me, too.
I'm Michael.
I guess you're new around here.
Are you hungry? Wanna get something to eat?
Ouch.
I wouldn't have given my Mom such a hard time about moving here if I'd known I was going to meet you.
I used to fight with my family all the time... just got fed up and ran away.
Now you and David...
No. They've made me one of them, but I miss my family.
Let's go see them.
I have to talk to you. Please wake up.
Have to sleep. Have to sleep, Michael.
When?
I have to talk to you. Can I come up?
Do you know where David took me tonight, Star? Do you?!
Yes... and I'm to blame for it. If you hadn't met me... if I hadn't liked you... I tried to warn you...
That night in the cave -- that wasn't wine they gave me to drink... it was blood! David's blood. I'm one of them, Star! I'm just like them!
Not yet... You're like Laddie and me... Half-vampires... You're not a full vampire until you've made your first kill... You were supposed to be mine... but I couldn't, Michael.
Why not?
Because I love you...
Then it's not too late for us...
It's not too late for you to be saved... but each night... it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing...
I know, I've felt it...
David's looking for me... I have to go.
You've got to put this on.
Take laddie.
Huh?
They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they?
It's gone. I feel it!
What!? He <u>can</u> and I <u>can't</u>?! No fair!!
This is kind of a cool place.
I'm so excited I just can't hide it. I'm about to lode control and I think I like it.
Grandpa does not own a T.V. Have you noticed? There's no T.V. Santa Carla has no malls, no Cineplexes and now I won't even have MTV. I will not know anything hip happening anymore.
Hey, Sam, we're flat broke.
This room is mine.
I was here first.
You're beautiful.
Where are we going?
Nowhere.
Then what's the rush? You're chasing that girl, why don't you just admit it? I'm at the mercy of your sex glands!
Mom, you hitched all the way to Berkeley once, remember?
Do I have to do this?
Go away.
You're supposed to watch me and entertain me, and make me appreciate the brief but happy years of childhood.
What did <u>you</u> do last night? You look wasted.
You don't suppose Grandpa's an alien, do you?
What would that make Mom?
Did you spill something?
No. Why?
I told you it was pretty weird Chinese food.
Wanna go to the comic book store?
Mom's home?...
I'm making you a sandwich.
Lose the earring, Michael. It's not happening. It's just not happening.
Piss off.
Michael?
What happened, Michael!?
Nanook...
What about Nonook? What have you done to Nanook?! What have you done to my dog, you asshole?!
What did you to do him, Michael? Why did he bite you?
What??
We've got to stick together, Sam. You've got to help me.
What about Mom?
No! We can't tell Mom! Please, Sam. Don't tell her.
I don't know, Michael. This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
It's that girl from the boardwalk. Is she one of them?
Star.
Who are you calling?
Michael! Get behind the wheel.
What's the matter?
Sixteen.
What do you want from us?
Pretty nasty out, Mac. Thirty-five knots.
All right... Box of dynamite... box of thermite... three shotguns... box of flares... two flare guns... thirty cans gasoline... and a case of alcohol.
Maybe dinner.
Dogs don't eat each other.
Where these tracks headed?
What do you mean "got" to the dog?
Clark, did you notice anything strange about that dog? Just anything at all? Any little thing?
That night?
Yeah.
What was he doing in the rec room?
Well, after I worked on him -- thought I'd let him rest. Left the room for a bit. When I came back, he was gone.
Well, where was he? Where did he go?
Don't know. Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him.
How long were you with the dog? Alone, I mean?
What the hell you looking at me like that for?
Was that dog, the Norwegian dog?
Couldn't make much of it myself.
I've asked him to try and locate the site. Okay with you?
Sure. You think there's a connection?
Look, I know it's hard to believe...
So what's our problem?
... It could have gotten to somebody...
Anybody sick?
Listen to me, Garry. Please...
Don't you understand?! That Thing didn't want to become a dog...
Damn you, Blair! You've already got everybody half-hysterical around here.
You can't let anybody leave!
Whatever that Norwegian dog was... It... It was capable of changing its form... ... when it attacked our dog... it somehow was able to digest... or... absorb it... and in the process shaped its own cells to imitate our dog's cells exactly... ... This for instance isn't dog at all -- it's imitation... We got to it before it had time to finish or...
Finish what?
What you doin'?
Nobody's getting in here. You can tell them all that!
Now why'd you go and...
And I don't want any more food with sedatives in it. I know what you're up to. Don't think I don't. And if anyone tries to get in here -- I've got rope. I'll hang myself before it gets to me.
Too damn dangerous.
... Can't you see...? If one cell of this Thing got out it could imitate every living thing on Earth. Nothing could stop it! Nothing!
Look Blair, maybe you're right about this. But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over. I'm unarmed and I'm coming in.
How you doin', old boy?
I don't know who to trust.
Know what you mean, Blair. Trust is a tough thing to come by these days. Just trust in the Lord.
Watch Clark.
What?
I've changed my mind... I'd... I'd like to come back inside... I don't want to stay out here any more... Funny things... I hear funny things out here.
Have you come across Fuchs?
Fuchs...? No, it's not Fuchs... You must let me back in... I won't harm anyone... I promise...
Happens all the time, man. They're falling out of the skies like flies. Government knows all about it... Chariots of the Gods, man... They practically own South America. I mean they taught the Incas everything they knew...
Childs, where's that magneto from Chopper One?
What?
Auxiliary light cables...? Been cut.
Somebody broke in.
Childs!!
Let go of me...
Don't get near 'em. The plants! They're alive. Those things can imitate anything...
We got to burn 'em.
Why didn't it imitate Fuchs? Isn't that its number -- to get more recruits.
Could have been anytime. Anywhere.
Let's open it.
Let's open it. Now...
Why you so damn anxious to let him in here...
He's so close. Maybe our best chance to blow him away.
You catch anything he was saying?
I suppose... well, it's possible someone might have lifted it from me. But...
That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt. Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?
I said where? Where'd you go?!
Was dark... find a light...
Lighten your load, sucker. You ain't the judge and executioner around here!
Childs! That a fuse?
Cut that out, Copper. Nauls? What's taking you?!
I'm working it! Nothing's happening!
That's impossible, man! Okay, Clark, out of the john where I can see you!
It's shorted out or something!
Somebody's taken it. I can't find it!
Cut him loose of the line up by his shack.
Cut him loose?
What's happening?
Torch it over there!
The dogs?
MacReady!
Look, I'm just guessing...
... So it crashes, and this guy, whoever he is, gets thrown out, or walks out, and ends up freezing.
Yeah, they dig him up and cart him back. He gets thawed out, wakes up and scares the shit out of them. And they get into one hell of a brawl...
Now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, huh?
I don't know how. Because he's different than we are. Because he's a space guy. What do you want from me, anyway. Go ask Blair.
I can get maybe another five or six feet out of it.
Where's the other half?
What we going to do?!
Torch them!!
But...
What do we do about those three?
MacReady!
What?
Garry's missing!
Oh, shit! Well, hang on!
Well, who says I want you going with me?!
... Nothing human could have made it back here in this weather without a guideline...
What are you doing?
We found your clothes -- the ones you tried to burn.
What clothes?
... Ever occur to the jury that anybody could have gotten to some of my clothes and stuck them up...
Palmer, you and Copper tie everyone down. Real tight.
What for?
You ain't tying me up.
Then I'll have to kill you.
We should have jumped his ass.
Load of bullshit.
Spaceship of some kind.
I think so.
Not the only one.
The fire's got the temperature way up all over camp... won't last long though.
Neither will we.
Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
Maybe we shouldn't.
Maybe we shouldn't make it.
If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.
Screw regulations! Four guys could be crawling around on their bellies out there!
My God, what in hell happened here?
Hey, Sweden!!!
Anything?
What are you doing?
Could be important work. Might as well bring it back.
Well, who's got access to it?
Would that test have worked?
Now hold him.
I'm a real light sleeper, Childs...
And if anyone tries to wake me...
I guess you're okay.
Thank you.
... Guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us.
Nothing we can do about that.
Yes, there is. I'd like to go up.
In this weather?
Goes on like that quite awhile. What do you gentlemen make of it?
Hold on, damn it. We're getting nowhere... If this bit of Blair's about absorbing and imitating is true... then that dog could have gotten to anybody.
How long will it take you to prepare this?
A couple of hours.
Can there be... some kind of test? To find out who's what?
I don't see how... when I'm finished I return it right away.
When was the last time you used it?
I'm getting worried about you. You ought to have a checkup.
Let's just not get worried about anything just now.
After all this mess then.
Gotta be from the Norwegian camp.
How far's that?
'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
How many in their party?
Right. Why not?
Hey, man...!
You reach anybody yet?
We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man. It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
Couple seconds of an Argentine disco station.
Put that down!
No.
Look, if you're going to keep bitching, MacReady -- Palmer's offered to take him up...
We're on fire!
Don't let up, Childs!
You're not thinking of going after them, are you?
Get these things out of supply and meet me over by the snowmobiles.
You're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got.
Ah... no one... I give it to Copper when he needs it...
Let's rush him. He's not going to blow us all up.
Pure nonsense. This won't prove a damn thing.
Looks good.
How long's it been?
Four!
What's...
Oh, I got you. Not too long.
How's that Thing get to the dogs? I though we stopped it in time.
Copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight.
No it ain't there. Would I be asking if it were there?
Sanchez...? Hey, who...
Somebody definitely messed with it.
We going to make it?
Sanchez, you and Palmer search the inside...
What kind of test?
Tie up Clark, too.
He's dead.
How we going to try and find out who's... you know, who's who?
Where were the flashlights?
We've got to find Fuchs. When we find him -- we kill him.
Why?
What if it doesn't come?
He might just wait us out.
That thing's too smart to be hiding any more of its clothes, MacReady.
This storm do that?
... Hey, somebody! Open up, it's me, MacReady... ... Come on, damn it... The towline snapped. Been crawling around like a seal out here...
We're going to draw a little bit of everybody's blood.
What are you going to do? Drink it?
What is it?
Where was he trying to go?
What about Childs?
You and Nauls got to block off the west side bunks, the mess hall and the kitchen.
You crazy? He might be inside already?
Get back!!
The generator!
Got Sanchez... World War Three wouldn't mess with this fucker... Can go through walls... And it's like all over the place...
Calm down and get in your position.
Maybe it ain't coming.
Then we go after him.
You jerking off or just pissed?
We got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?
Get your gear on.
Magnesium of some type... or some kind of strange alloy. And those poor dumb bastards had to go and blow the hell out of it.
So what do you make of it?
You know damn well what we both make of it.
Somebody else sure as hell thought so.
We should sleep in shifts.
What's happened?!
MacReady, that you?
Yeah!
It's the generator I think! No power.
... Made sure I got ahead of him on the towline on the way back... cut him loose.
MacReady...?
He's one of them.
You hear that?
It's got into the pub! It's turned on the stereo!
What?!
It's in between us and them!! How we going to get back?!
It must have been hard, leaving your work.
Now how did you get hurt?
I had an accident.
What do you do on the towers?
On the towers?
Ah... no.
Don't tell me you're a mud carrier.
... Thousands and thousands of people. And sometimes we live in great buildings that reach up five or ten stories.
And everyone looks like us?
She didn't want me to be a climber. She wanted me to be a planner like her.
How can they just go back to work as if nothing happened?
What else can they do?
Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
There's a place that might help... we could try going there.
Where?
The Hall of Books.
You have books?! Kalen, you've got to take me there. There might be history. Records. Something to help us find where the Morlocks took --
No one ever comes here. My mother told me stories about it late at night. They tell all the children.
What kind of stories?
I had a friend who came here once. Sort of a dare.
What happened?
I think we should go on by ourselves.
No...
Please, just listen to me... Your mother would be very cross with me if you got hurt. I'll find her.
But you're only a mud carrier.
... Well, you wanted to see it.
This is it?
Yes. Just about here.
Right up your alley, I would think. You are from the past, yes?
How did you know?!
I can smell carcinogens and industrial pollutants on your skin that have not been known here for -- -- 800,000 years perhaps. Don't keep me in suspense. What year?
1899.
I must say, you look remarkably good. You don't want a book then?
What are you?
I'm the librarian. I've always been the librarian.
I know you -- you're an automaton of some sort that --
Sir... have you a name?
Please, we need your help. The Morlocks have taken --
Morlocks --
You know of them?
Who doesn't know the Morlocks?
Do you know where they live?
Oh yes... They found our knowledge useful for a time. They used us much as your people did. Then they decided they had learned enough so they tore us up for spare parts.
But you escaped.
I was lucky. The others weren't.
Regenerating fission reactor, you wouldn't understand. It's power is well beyond your neanderthal cranial capacity.
We need your help.
Because you'll never die.
Excuse me?
So, Relic, you want to open Pandora's box, do you? See all the mysteries exposed?
Yes.
And if the truth is so horrible that it will haunt your dreams for all time?
When was his mother taken?
Last night.
Send him away.
What?
Send him home. You don't want him to see it.
My God... I saw this.
It frightens you.
Yes...
So, do we go on?
Yes.
Aren't you a plucky little -- ?
It's what they want you to see.
This is the way in?
Yes... Are you sure you want to do this?
In for a penny, in for a pound. Do you know that saying?
Machines?
Yes.
Vox?
What's it all for?
The air... the power.
Why did they built it?
Alexander... Listen to me, it was wrong to bring you. You're not going to find what you're looking for.
What do you mean?
They raise them like cattle... Feed them until they're ready and then hunt them.
No...
This has to end.
End...?
Vox --
Takes a licking but keeps on ticking... ... For a while anyway.
What can I do? Tell me what to do.
Nothing to do, I'm afraid. I'm just a librarian after all. Wasn't exactly made for all this swashbuckling. Very Byronic end, though. I appreciate that. Do you know Byron?
Vox...
I'm babbling. Good to have someone to talk to for a change... But you need to go. Take her out of here... ... I don't have long.
I won't leave you like this.
Go back to the light. You weren't made for this. I was... I was made for this moment.
I don't understand.
Now get out of my sight, you hideous primate.
I'll never forget this.
I should hope not... ... Alexander... Make them read my books. Tell them who they are. Who they could be.
What's your name?
Alexander.
Well, Alexander, as a fellow scientist I know you have a thousand questions --
You came underground when the world was ending above. And you evolved. Some into the Morlocks and others --
No, we created the Morlocks.
Created?
You wouldn't understand. We genetically engineered the Morlock class to serve our needs.
As slaves.
And centuries later when we tried to emerge into the sun again, we couldn't. Our adaptation was too successful. We survived... we endured... for this.
How do you control the Morlocks?
We make them see what we wish.
How?
And what of the Eloi?
They survived above. Became what they are.
No... they didn't survive only to be your food. You did that.
I'm afraid your indignation is lost here. I have no more "human" response to the Eloi then you would have to a carrot. It's just how we live now.
But this is barbaric! Have you completely lost all sense of --
And who are you, Alexander? Who are you to question thousands of years of evolution? This is the world now. I am fact.
What?
Go back to where you came from. Or die here.
Why would you let me go back?
Say I just come back again?
Alexander, yours is a world of brocade and velvet, not tooth and claw. Why would you come back to this? To save a few cattle? No.
Why?
We have lost the capacity to reproduce. But the species must continue.
So you take their best...
When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool. We're breeding them for submission. Soon they will be fully domesticated.
You took her because she helped me.
She won't remember you. None of them will. You will be forgotten. That is how history works.
A man can change his history.
Now will you go?
If I can only find the right door... the lady or the tiger...
No...
That was a foolish thing to do.
I could have a hundred Morlocks here in thirty seconds.
I know.
I'm tired of running.
But you've earned a reward for your valor. I think you should become. You'll like it here. Once you get used to the darkness.
I don't think that's going to happen.
And why not?
It's spectacular...
Thanks. Old Nell's my girl all right. Al least when she decides to move, stubborn beast.
I've only read about them -- and the new internals.
Now that's what I call plain crazy -- internal combustion is just too dangerous, all those little explosions, never catch on.
How do you keep the water temperature stable?
God -- could have killed me -- bad girl, Nell! How did you know to do that?
I just love mechanical things.
Well, much obliged -- I'm always forgetting the confounded brake -- say, if you wait until I get her up and running I'll give you a perambulation. Tell you all about her.
Ahhh... I'm afraid I've got a prior commitment.
Next time then. We perambulate here most every night.
May I help you?
I -- what are you?!
I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk. VOX registration NY-114. May I help you?
The 2005 terraforming demolitions for the lunar excavations sent the moon into a diminishing retrograde orbit resulting in global gravitational fluctuations, increased seismic activity and tidal anomalies. Can I tell you more?
No -- wait -- the moon's falling out of orbit -- that's not possible!
Well, considering it is, in fact, happening, I would assume it's possible. The retrograde orbit began in 2005 when the demolitions for the lunar colonies --
Why is it -- breaking up?
You're late.
Got here as soon as I could.
Dance with me...
You know I can't.
You promised me flowers.
What?
You promised me flowers tonight, don't you even remember?
Sorry... I was distracted.
Well there's something new.
I need to... um... talk to you.
Talk away, Professor.
... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth. You see it over the rocks there? Sailors consider that an omen of good fortune; the hunter watching over them on their travels... Are you listening to me, Alex?
What? Yes -- Orion -- good fortune -- sailors.
All right, what is it now?
Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you.
Admiration? My my.
I mean... well... affection.
Oh dammit, I love you! I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't think, all I do is moon over you and -- hum, apparently.
You know, the moment is rather dying here.
I know it's not a diamond but --
A moonstone.
You're late.
Got here as soon as I could.
Dance with me...
You know I can't.
Alex, what is it?
Holding you... again.
Darling.
I need... to talk to you.
All right...
Let's walk through the park...
No... let's walk through the city.
Alex, what is it?
Alex...?!
Why do we have to race for heaven's sake?!
My God...
You're so pale... I hope you're not coming down with something.
No, I'm fine. I'm... ... wonderful. Just walking down the street with you again.
We took a walk three days ago.
They are rare... ... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth --
The sailor's omen of good fortune. The hunter watching over him on his travels.
Heavens, look at that now!
Now I know you're ill -- passing up the chance to explore some new gadget.
Alex... people are staring.
Let them.
... The point is I know it will work once the, um, numbers and such are in order.
Do you know you were humming?
I was not.
Somewhere around "D+2xy something something."
Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
Tonight's the night?
... One day he'll be discovered by some future archeologists and they won't know what to make of him. The thick brow, so lacking in imagination. The dim little eyes, devoid of curiosity.
You know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers.
Where's the challenge in that?
Alex, this is your first year as an associate professor. You might want to play things a little more conservatively.
Look at them, Philby, all alike, everyone in an identical bowler hat. Do you want your students to turn out like them?
I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.
I don't. I want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see.
You may not like it, but this is the world we live in, Alex. Little grey men with little grey hats.
In the future, we'll be better.
What?
Emma actually likes chalk dust -- says it smells like me.
The most able inventor I know and you can't tie a simple four-in- hand.
That's how I knew we were destined to be together. When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk. They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled. At that moment -- I just knew. How did you know with Molly?
She made the best Shepherd's pie I ever tasted.
Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
Alex, really... good luck tonight. She's a fine girl, and she's done wonderful things for you.
Oh?
All these clocks -- how can you constantly be running late?!
I've been working.
I came by the house every day after the funeral. And then every week. Then every other month. Then I stopped coming. Did you even notice?
I'm sorry, David.
It hurt me, Alex. Very much.
It's my Jamie's birthday today. Your godson. He's nine years old. At his party he asked me if Uncle Alex was coming. I told him no. Then he asked me if you didn't like him anymore.
For God's Sake, David --
There are some things I need to say to you. You may not like hearing them, but I don't know if I'll ever get another chance --
You care for me. And you're concerned. And I have to start living my life again. I hear it from Mrs. Watchit every day.
But you won't listen. You won't see me, you won't see anyone. What would you like me to tell Jamie? That Uncle Alex is busy? That Uncle Alex is hiding up there in his laboratory --
Hiding?
You know that's what it is. Mrs. Watchit tells me you're here at all hours -- day and night --
That's because I'm working. You remember that? You used to care about your work.
What happened to Emma will never go away. It's part of you now and it always will be. But you have to learn to live with it...
I live with it every minute of every day.
I know that --
You don't know that. You couldn't possibly. If I'd only done this, or that, if I'd arrived ten minutes earlier, or later. If we'd taken a different path or I hadn't fought the man for the ring. You have no idea what it is to relive every moment of that night -- consider every action you made -- and every one of them wrong.
It wasn't your fault, Alex.
Wasn't it?... I have a dream almost every night now. The Lady and the Tiger, you remember that story? In the dream I'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors. Behind every door, save one, is a tiger. I have to make the decision. Which door conceals Emma? And I just stand there... looking at the doors...
Alex, nothing will ever change what happened, but --
David... I appreciate your concern, I do. But I ask you to have faith in me. Just for a little while longer. I'm working on something now. Something... extraordinary.
What is it?
You wouldn't believe me.
I would.
I'll tell you what... come by for dinner in a week and I'll show you.
Why don't you come to our house instead?
I can't do that --
When's the last time you were outside this house -- -- or this room?
I can't leave when I'm so close.
There are trains leaving Grand Central every then minutes. A dozen liners leaving the harbor. Get on one of them. Go to Singapore, Scotland, Manchuria, anywhere, just away from here --
That's absurd --
You won't say that in a week.
All right. I'll come for dinner. And in the meantime... you'll think about what we discussed?
Good night, David.
And this would be my study. There was an elm tree outside the window then.
This... was my home.
Couldn't help but overhearing. Two fine young people starting out on the road of life. I wish you the very best.
Thank you...
I hope it's a happy journey for you both -- and much as I hate to do this, moved as I am by your protestations of love, I'll be needing your money now.
Sir...?
And your jewelry too. I guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss.
Did you hear me, lad?
You're up! You must be feeling better --
How long did you travel?
Yes.
Is there a lot of illness?
His curiosity is amazing.
Kalen will tire you out if you let him. He's always been curious. His father was firm with him but... it's just his way.
Your husband is dead?
It's hard for me to imagine a better place. Where I come from there's so much... frenzy. Day and night. It seems we're all running faster and faster... ... All in identical bowler hats.
You're not from beyond the valley.
We don't have anything like this. Or the machine where Kalen found you. And I doubt they do beyond the valley... Now where do you come from?
You might find the truth rather hard to understand.
Oh, that explains everything.
I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
That machine --
Allowed me to travel from my time to yours.
How long ago?
Why?
Why not?
I might find the truth rather hard to understand?... Can you go back?
Yes. Or forward into the future. I suppose I really should check on the machine, see that it hasn't been damaged...
I'll take you tomorrow... You must have seen a lot on your journey.
Is he all right?
I'm going to sit with Kalen. Keep the fire burning if you can.
I'll take you to your machine tomorrow.
You seem fascinated by the stars.
You can see so many here.
Don't then have stars where you come from?
Good night, then.
Mara, I had a strange dream last night. I was here, walking through a forest very much like this, and then...
Then you came to a desert and mountains...
Yes.
And you saw a shape ahead of you...
Yes!
We all have that dream.
All of you?
Every night.
You share dreams? That's incredible.
This is magnificent...
Thank you.
And this is your "work"?
The mud carriers.
I can see Kalen's point.
Want to be a high climber now, do you?
What you need is an engineer. If you set up a system of pulleys and counterweights, some basic block and tackle mechanism, you could to this a lot more easily.
It's not supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be beautiful.
What's it all for?
I don't understand.
I mean, why do you do it? What purpose does it serve?
It has no purpose. It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?
Most things. We're very high on purpose.
It's always been this way here. We work on the towers all our lives. When we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors...
Or mud carriers.
And there's no shame to that. It's all the same here. Everyone has an important job to do. We all work together and couldn't survive without each other.
What are you?
I'm a planner. I help decide where the new towers go and what they should look like.
How do you decide?
... It was a great city. The greatest city in the world.
You liked it there.
Oh, very much... ... I used to work somewhere in that direction, I think. A huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature.
Learning was important?
Oh very. Learning, commerce, the arts -- the whole place was buzzing all the time. Night and day.
Did you have fires at night?
Only to keep warm. For illumination we had gaslights on most of the streets and a new invention called electrical lighting that made it seem like daylight all through the night.
It must have been safe.
Oh, it was... ... Most of the time.
It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
Alexander...?
Those rocks, over there... they're the same... this is... Central Park.
You know this?
This is where my journey started... right here.
You lost someone.
Yes.
Someone you loved very much.
Yes... After her death, it was intolerable for me here... The future had to be better.
Is it?
You've welcomed me into your home. Into your lives. Everyone has... For the first time in a long time it doesn't hurt quite so much. I thank you for that.
Good -- it looks fine. We had quite a ride together...
It's undamaged?
Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.
So you can use it now?
Yes... I suppose so.
Go back to your own time?
Alexander, take my son away. Take him back to your time. Will you do that?
Mara --
Kalen...
Mara...?
Mara -- what -- ?!
It was different then.
Oh huzzah, the master's home.
Do you have it?!
Don't torture me -- do you have it?
I have it, but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change. I've laid out your green coat.
Now that's more like it. You look a proper gentlemen for once.
Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?
Oh, I'm already swooning.
Sir, Mr. Philby is here.
Here?
Yes, sir, he --
All right, Mrs. Watchit. You can go.
May I get you some --
Dr. Philby, Dr. Hartdegen. I received the most extraordinary letter last week. From a parent. We are always pleased to receive letters from parents. They are our employers, after all. This gentleman's son is in your class, Dr. Hartdegen.
I see.
As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering", am I correct?
Well, just as I thought. Surely it's all been a terrible mistake. This parent actually suggested that your freshman course in applied mathematics has somehow become a seminar on theoretical physics!
Imagine that.
But I know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum.
Well... perhaps I have "deviated" the tiniest bit.
Might I ask why?
Sir, that curriculum is forty years out of date. The students today are looking toward the new century -- they want to be challenged and inspired, not spoon-fed dusty old equations that have been proved a thousand times. They want to explore.
And roosters.
No, Dr. Hartdegen, they are not just chickens and roosters. They are science. Perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you. Perhaps they don't "challenge" you --
No, sir --
Animal husbandry is science, Dr. Hartdegen. I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years. I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns, social behavior and breeding. Empirical, exacting, quantifiable records.
With respect, sir, would we have the telegraph without fantasy? Would we have radium and X-rays without someone first dreaming we could?
The advances you speak of were the result of countless years of study and empirical experimentation, a careful evolutionary process, not chalkboard parlor-tricks.
My equations are not parlor-tricks!
Abstract mathematics, relativity of dimensions, geometrical "durations" -- even allowing for the uses of speculation, what is the point?
Yes, sir.
And hungry, I'd say. You had such a long journey.
I did...
"Eloi"?
What are your people called?
Well, I guess you'd call us... New Yorkers.
We had another visitor from beyond the valley about four years ago. His name was Moren. Do you know him?
No...
He said he traveled for two months.
Oh, very different. But not entirely... I mean we have lots of, um, trees and such. But not everywhere. And more roads. And buildings.
Why?
To live in. There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
New Yorkers.
I am the oldest.
No, I mean someone considerably older. Your father perhaps?
My father has gone to a better place.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
Good morning, Alexander. Feeling up to some work?
Where do they take them?!
We don't know.
We have to go after them, find where -- !
Alexander, I know you're trying to help. But they don't come back.
What do you mean?!
They've gone to a better place.
You know that's not true.
We choose to believe it.
This is out life, Alexander. It's a hard life but it is how we have always lived.
Then it's time to change that --
You won't even try?
My fowl have polluted the yard.
Sir, if I may --
If I might explain, sir --
You supported his application, Dr. Philby. You are his senior, advisor. I depend upon you to restrain his... excesses. Any repetition of the behavior I witnessed in his classroom today and there will be consequences for you both.
Yes, sir.
How did you get hurt?
Kalen...
I found you. I saved your life. You were bleeding all over the place!
What did you do at night?
We'll see about that.
I want to see your home. Will you take me?
Kalen, right now you need to go up to bed. You're exhausting Alexander.
Kalen, it's all right, I'm here --
They're here! They're inside the house -- !
No, you're safe --
They're inside --
Hello, Mrs. Watchit. You're looking in the pink.
I wonder if that poor girl has any idea what she's in for?
I don't know what to tell you, sir. He's been gone this whole week.
And you've no idea where he went?
Sir?
I think I might be. But there'll be some changes made. I run a tight house.
I have no doubt of that. I'll come by in the morning and we'll arrange it. Goodnight, Mrs. Watchit.
You ok?
I'm fine.
[Beat] Listen, I hate to bother you...
Then don't.
But... what about Starks?
What about Starks?
Should we be...
Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.
Don't get all worked up, Justin. I expected some common sense on your part and clearly I was expecting too much. [Beat] Just open the drawer.
We never should have done this to him...
Well, your condition's pretty serious.
[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct?
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
He's recovering on the third floor.
Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic!
I don't know better. All I know is that you left me in there.
In where?
We were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to.
That wasn't a fucking restraint.
Relax.
Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
You're just suffering from delusions that are unfortunately part of your condition.
I didn't dream it. I may have been asleep but it wasn't a dream. BECKER sits down in a CHAIR, half-shrouded in the light.
I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
I don't give a shit about your patient!
We are not birds of a feather.
Long live the Organization for the Organized!
Hello, William. I understand you've been asking for me almost every hour. I would've been here sooner but you gave our little state visitor quite a bit to talk to me about.
That's too bad.
It is. But when it comes down to it, you just have to patient with them. They'd rather have their vacation, too, so they just push dealing with our "practices" off to the New Year.
They make it hard for you to get away with your business, huh?
And what's that?
My business?
Yes.
Getting away with things. Like whatever I may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison.
I'll say a prayer for you in Church today, Starks. Maybe the Gods can pick up where the medicine left off.
You sure you know where to find one?
I've managed to every Sunday of my life. [Beat] Some of us are God- fearing men, Starks.
And what does that mean?
Becker, how do you sleep at night?
Who are you?
I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
[Beat] You're his son?
No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing.
You died, Starks. Years ago, in the hospital.
I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't you?
No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.
I don't know how you died. The last time I put you in the Jacket was just after you told me you remembered killing that police officer...
I didn't say I remembered killing him. I just repeated some words to get myself back in there.
I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out.
How?
Of people like you. People I was just trying to help. They couldn't get worse so I thought, with medication, they might get...
Medication? What kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer?
It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be...
So, what, you guinea pig sick people to find out?
The three of you weren't regular patients. You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove.
How did you come to know their names?
You just told me. The last time I was with you was when I was in the Jacket. I'm in it right now, Dr. Becker.
I don't understand...
I'm in it as we speak. [Beat] You're haunting yourself right now. [Beat] I guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else does. You didn't make history like you wanted to, huh, Dr. Becker. It turned out different, didn't it?
I didn't put you in Alpine Grove.
Do I know you from somewhere?
That's right! Goddamn, you're the spitting image. I didn't know he had a son.
Did you know my father?
My father used to talk about you.
Look here, I don't like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me...
That's too bad.
I thought you said you never knew your father.
I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death?
He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it.
We're late.
I wish they'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget. Our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we don't have.
It's the ticking of a box on a sheet of paper no one cares about.
What should they be looking for?
Where? [Beat] It's Becker isn't it? He's doing stuff, isn't he?
You look like you've lost some weight. Are you eating?
You done with your small talk?
Sure.
This is really happening, isn't it?
[Beat] What do you need me to do?
I need to get this letter to someone.
I can't take you out of here in your condition...
And I can't stay here in my condition. I am going to die tonight. It's already been decided.
No, it hasn't.
I'm sorry I can't tell you more about your father's death, Mr. Starks. Our own medical examiners determined only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right around the time the Alpine Grove's staff changed and I'm afraid we didn't have the best record system before then.
His body was found on January 1, 1993, but do you know if that was long after he had died?
No, I don't. I'm sorry. I wish I knew more.
What about Dr. Thomas Becker or Dr. Loel Lorenson? There was also a Dr. Gries, I think.
Well, Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital. If she was here at the time your father was, then I'm sure she'd be of more help to you.
What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries?
Get your fucking hands off my daughter!
Mom, he just fixed our car.
I'm sorry? Your face looks awfully familiar, I just can't quite place it...
Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
Jackie, go play in the snow.
Why?
Come on, mom. Don't fall asleep...
You two ok?
Your mom take anything before this happened?
Yeah, but I don't know what.
[Beat] What's your name?
But I like it I guess.
Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
You're just gonna walk?
What're those?
Dog tags. [Off her blank look] They've got your name and date of birth for identification.
What for?
I think I can remember what's on them.
What'd you do? Snoop all over the place? You had no right. You had no right to go through anything.
[Beat] I know it doesn't make sense. It doesn't even make sense to me.
Jackie, I'm William Starks. I can prove it.
What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital.
Stop it! Stop it! JACKIE covers her ears and looks at him, pleading with her eyes. STARKS' eyes plead right back.
I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.
You can't be William Starks. He's dead.
[Beat] What?
William Starks is dead... [Beat] I've been to his grave.
[Beat] What?
I looked it up.
I gave you my dog tags.
No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.
How'd he die?
I don't know. But he did die. STARKS falters under the news. JACKIE looks around, through her now blurred eyes, like she might find some help in the apartment. She settles for the BOTTLE of VODKA on the table, lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink, then laughs nervously as she looks up.
